    "Research has shown that gifted children can exhibit some of the same behaviours as those on the autism spectrum. Social quirkiness is normal in bright kids as well as in those with autism. Like kids on the spectrum, gifted kids also have keen memories and a good grip on language. They can also get lost in their imaginations or think logically and critically to the extent that imagination seems far away. Both groups can also find it difficult to manage social interactions with their peers. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, these are broad generalisations of behaviours. Once you dive deeper, you can see there are some salient differences. For example, a gifted child may present an extensive and advanced vocabulary with a rich verbal style. A child on the autism spectrum may have an advanced use of vocabulary, but they may not have full comprehension of the language they use. They may also have a less inviting verbal style that lacks the engagement of others. By extension, these differences can cause students with aspergers to have learning styles and needs that deviate from those of gifted students. \n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have shown that it may be possible to distinguish children on the autism spectrum from gifted children by examining their use of language. This forms the basis of Project 3. This project will address convergent and divergent aspects in communication & language between individuals with aspergers and gifted individuals."

    "\n",
    "Healthcare waste is incurred any time a patient, doctor, or healthcare worker engages in unnecessary medical activity - ranging from preventable mistakes in medical care, to misdiagnoses, provision of unnecessary treatments, and procedural inconsistencies. Research has shown that up to 20% of all healthcare resource expenditures are quality-associated waste and this can amount to a staggering sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Singapore, part of the costs (and risks) are borne by individuals and families, while part of the costs (and risks) are accounted for by the State - borne by taxpayers, and/or private health insurers. To eliminate waste, the Singapore government has come to incorporate technology into various care models to overcome the various cost- and quality-based challenges in the Healthcare sector. Most of these technologies are procured from private healthtech companies and start-ups. "

Any ideas on the backburner for one reason or another? Any ideas just in the planning phase?** Even if you are working on them with someone else, they still apply here. If you can mention the interest that you have that relates to the project, that would be great; it may help others.   \n",
       "2  I need to prepare both mentally and physically for a long time just to go on a casual outing. Can you relate? The only time I agree to go out with people is when I have been given a lot of notice. Even if it’s just a casual outing that seems like nbd to most people. \\n\\nFor example I am going with my SO to his friends house for a dink in a few days and I can’t stop thinking about it. What am I going to wear? How will I respond if they ask me this question or that question? I prepare to meet friends like I’m preparing to go for an interview (don’t even get me started about how I prepare for an actual interview) I feel this is not normal. I’m new to this sub.\\n\\nAlso, if I run into someone spontaneously like someone visits without telling me or I see someone out and about or my husband forgets to tell me that someone’s coming by - I am a completely different person, like I don’t know how to socialize and I am so awkward. I’ve even hidden in the bathroom or bedroom a few times and told my husband to say I’m not home. I feel horrible and like I am so fucked up for this.

Weekly post #264 [Here's last week's thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/11g6v1j/hows_your_week_going_so_far_weekly_post_263/)\\n\\nSuggestions are ALWAYS welcome on how to improve the threads I post at any time. After all, I do this because the community wants these threads to exist, and I take the time out of my day (every Thursday and Saturday) to post the weekly threads, to ensure the community gets what it feels it needs.\\n\\n**So, continuing with the theme... /r/aspergers, How is your week going so far?** :)   \n",

Weekly post #264 [Here's last week's Solitude Project Saturday](https://old.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/11i5qdt/solitude_project_saturday_what_projects_are_you/)\\n\\n**So, /r/aspergers, what projects do you have on the go right now? Any ideas on the backburner for one reason or another? Any ideas just in the planning phase?** Even if you are working on them with someone else, they still apply here. If you can mention the interest that you have that relates to the project, that would be great; it may help others.   \n",
       "2  I need to prepare both mentally and physically for a long time just to go on a casual outing. Can you relate? The only time I agree to go out with people is when I have been given a lot of notice. Even if it’s just a casual outing that seems like nbd to most people. \\n\\nFor example I am going with my SO to his friends house for a dink in a few days and I can’t stop thinking about it. What am I going to wear? How will I respond if they ask me this question or that question? I prepare to meet friends like I’m preparing to go for an interview (don’t even get me started about how I prepare for an actual interview) I feel this is not normal. I’m new to this sub.\\n\\nAlso, if I run into someone spontaneously like someone visits without telling me or I see someone out and about or my husband forgets to tell me that someone’s coming by - I am a completely different person, like I don’t know how to socialize and I am so awkward. I’ve even hidden in the bathroom or bedroom a few times and told my husband to say I’m not home. I feel horrible and like I am so fucked up for this. If I’m forced to interact I feel like they think I’m a completely different person from when I have had time to prepare   \n",
