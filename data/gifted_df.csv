"Does your brain automatically synthesize information rather than remember all the details? When I observe regular people interact, they tend to share their life experiences through storytelling. They say stuff like “the other day, I was walking into the grocery store, then bla-bla-bla” with a bunch of he said and she said throughout, in addition to commentary about how they felt. Essentially, they stay at the descriptive level. This seems geared towards social bonding.

When I think about the bulk of my own interactions, they tend to be at the explanatory and argumentative level. This means instead of describing every single detail, my brain tends to just synthesize the whole experience into a short summary “went to the grocery store, nothing out of the ordinary, got everything we need for the next 3 days”. Similarly when reading books, my brain just skips over anything that’s normal or predictable, and only focuses on the parts that surprise me.

Otherwise, the rest of my interactions are for getting my point across. There’s some agenda I want to influence, and I’ll provide arguments and explanations to support it. I also make up stories in order to convince, because anecdotes work on people who don’t think analytically (critically).",0
"Parents, what were the early signs that made you think your child is gifted? We just discovered that our son, who just turned 2 years and 4 months, have taught himself how to read. He started sight reading shortly after he turned 2. 

My son has always been good at remembering so we figured that he just memorized the words (although he knows how to sight read A LOT OF WORDS). 

Months later, we were surprised when he read an unfamiliar word. We asked him to read a word in our native language to be sure whether he could really read or not, and he read all of the words we asked him to. 

As a background, my son started humming songs at 13 months, knew all the letters and numbers by 15 months, and learned how to count (actual counting) by 18 months. 

It took a 15 minute trip to the grocery store for him to learn about shapes, including complicated ones like hexagon, pentagon, octagon, and trapezoid. He was about 16 months at the time. 

Has anyone experienced the same thing with their child? Our pedia advised us to get him tested for giftedness but I believe it’s way too early. Please share your experiences. What were the early signs of giftedness that your child exhibited?",0
"Gifted folks who struggled and then succeeded in career post-college, what were your valuable lessons? School was a breeze for me. 

I was consistently one of the top achievers. I was put in a special high school with a sort of Advanced Placement / Accelerated curriculum in my country in Southeast Asia.

But I was lazy, I barely studied, barely took notes. Was always distracted flirting with my cute female classmates. I procrastinated everything at the very last minute.

Many classmates kinda despised me because sometimes I'd get the highest grades barely studying. Likewise, some professors were also hesitant to give me As and B+s for my papers and work because they knew I barely listened and that I crammed everything, but objectively my work was good.

 I was lazy and had bad work ethic but coasted through one of the top Unis in our country anyway.

That bit me in the ass post-college, I struggled for several years after work due to my poor work ethic, tardiness, and inclination to just drink and party.

Got fired a few times too, in some cases, in spectacularly embarrasing ways. I'm getting way better now but there's always room for improvement. 

Some of my contemporaries are already way ahead of me career-wise and income-wise. It makes me feel like shit sometimes. 

For you gifted folks who struggled and then succeeded in your careers post-college, what lessons did you learn? What did you do differently that made you successful? What did you do wrong that made you struggle?",0

"Programs similar to Beast Academy for Sciences/Languages Hello,

I'll be traveling with my 5 year old gifted daughter from end of May until end of August.

She's currently doing Beast Academy for Math as an enrichment program outside of school.
Is there anything similar for Sciences/Languages? I would like to do a bit of schooling with her while we're away, as she loves learning and thrives with routine. 
Also, she will be attending French Immersion when we come back, so I'm planning to start her with Duolingo kids. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you.",0
"Loneliness Hello, I have been on the internet for almost ten years now, and I would like to talk about how it has affected me as well as just express myself freely for once, not only on some matters related to the internet but also how this society has affected me while I grew up with it, but before I start- 
I would like to preface my opinions by saying that anything of what I try to express here, to the people who read it- it would only be like viewing a small portion of a blurry, shifting replica of a painting, i.e my self. A replica seen through the lens of one's own assimilated experiences, correlated with their ideological perceptions and psyche, even trivial ones, and as I intuit that understanding can only be attained through experience- it is imperative that my writings are seen as subjectively objective. Any experience a person perceives is dependent on how they subjectively process it, but it does not devalidate the idea of an objective reality as one can only perceive the objectivity, subjectively- and I think that it is the same for people as well. I do not agree with the notion that opinions can only be subjective as there seems to be a real, tangibly magnitudinal nature to reality- one person being taller than another, some liquids being heavier, etc and people can be different in a similar way as well, albeit the way it expresses in humans does not make it any less complex. 

I am not here to dwell on irrational eugenics however, as I do not have any desire to compare one person with another, i.e to say that one is better than the other. But I cannot ignore these differences, coming to the actual point now- since as long as I can remember, I have felt different than others in the sense that not only do I feel like there are differences solely in the formation of ideas but also that there are these, anatomical differences as well...A feeling that I am fundamentally different than most other people, some of you might have heard of the term ""giftedness"", now- I get that this term is sometimes used facetiously/in wrong contexts (usually when the person in question misconstrues/misinterprets what it means to be ""gifted"") but I do not want to delve into that rabbit hole in this post, instead I want to focus on the scientific side of it. Ever since a long time, people have noticed that there exists some real physical differences between human beings, for example: Some people can naturally build more muscle than others (which seems totally unfair), but apparently it all comes down to hormones and genetics (more prone to muscle hypertrophism) and again, in a similar way some people are more intelligent than others but again, the human brain is extremely complex, so people devised different methods to magnitudinalize intelligence, there have been other methods to identify intelligence but as I do not know enough about them, I am only going to focus on I.Q, overexcitabilities, sensitivism, synesthesia and some other subjects. Now, this feeling of difference I felt as I said before, I am pretty sure came from a difference in sensitivity, fundamental differences in how I processed information (Mild hyperthymesia, hyperphantasia, and multiple forms of synesthesia) and more controversially, intelligence. I remember slogging through the entire K-12 system, when I first entered kindergarten- I had already completed learning about addition, subtraction,multiplication, and division, and whatever the teacher taught us afterwards in later classes, from K.G to class 6-
I had already learnt all of it by looking up the syllabus. School felt like a place I would go to indulge in mind numbing chores and misophonic, artificial ""productivity"" when I could have been doing more while staying inside my house. After years of wasting unreciprocated time in school, (Of course I do not mean to say that schools are a waste of time, I just do not think that it is made for everyone) I got frustrated, and quite depressed and that's when I had a mental breakdown which changed my life from then on forever.
I decided that I would pretty much, try to willingly fail in subjects as nothing interested me anymore, it was kind of a retaliation against the education system in which I felt so oppressed in. I wanted to be a paleontologist as well as an astrophysicist when I was nine but the necessary rote memorization, uninterested+ some toxic teachers, even major family issues left me feeling empty inside, the exuberance I felt as a child grew weaker and weaker and eventually fainted wholly. I felt like I was entrenched underneath the ocean layer,  crushed under the suffocative pressure of what seemed to me like a dystopian, bureaucratic future as I lay floating static within the sea bed, asleep and petrified. And gradually, I went from being a topper to someone who did not really care at all. As soon as I started getting horrible marks, the people- instead of trying to comfort me, understand me, empathize with me- rampaged through me like a rogue wave with their snide, fickle and sly remarks. I was faced with relentless verbal abuse from my parents, mild but still- disappointed looks from my neighbours and relatives, even called a ""failed golden child"" as if I was an experiment. 
Eventually though, I got better, through the help of a miraculous device known as the internet. Computers were rare back then and I had something which was even rarer- an internet connection. 

It helped to keep my marks upto a decent level, alleviated the ceaseless, self loathing tirades within my head and I branched out from my old views that caged me, I sacrificed my little study time for time on the internet spent googling various things, things I never imagined I could get my hands on.It truly felt like a wondrous moment, the whole first two years of it- it was like a boon to me, offering me respite from my plight. It wasn't necessarily escapism as I tried to be aware of the loopholes I could fall into,
so I tried to distribute my focus and that's when I realized that I was hypersensitive to stuff, as well as showing symptoms of hyperfocus, perfectionism, intense desires, etc. When I reached class 9, I knew that I was different from others as it would be an extremely triggering experience for me if I had to divert my focus from one topic to another. 

To me, every single topic I felt attracted to, needed to be understood fully. I would spent 7-9 hours per day, looking up things online and watching video-essays. That caused me to deviate even further from the norm as I read mangas that affected me profoundly, like no other indian media back then could have (anime was already scarce then but somehow its popularity was decreasing further still, nowadays it's probably the most popular it's ever been in India which can lead to better diversification in art I think, anyways I apologize for the digression). I read berserk, made in abyss, death note, blam, so many light novels and watched so many films (interstellar, the social network, satyajit ray films as well as tagore songs, ghibli, the theory of everything, etc), watched attack on titan as it aired raw (watched all 4 seasons now),
listened to some of the most breath-taking music humans have ever created and I just felt so enamoured, dazzled and even conflicted at the realization that entire worlds had been tucked away underneath these curtains of ignorancy. Little did I know that, in a few years- I would be participating in one of the biggest races mankind had ever created. I was already feeling the shockwaves from class 8, as I noticed a stark difference in the study content between class 7 and 8. It felt different somehow, more abstract and complex, less texts and more problems to solve as I felt rust growing underneath my skin. None of that is to say that I didn't perform well though, I did and it still felt easy to me- its just that the things they introduced seemed to be the tip of a massive iceberg which I didn't wanna become a part of until I chose itself by my own accord, on my own natural pace. Come, class 10 and it was right infront of me, a massive mechanical tide that would wash away the organic frivolity, only letting sheer practicality, money, and arduous, boring, rote work into it, into an illusory, periodic replenishment. 



No way to escape it, I got thrashed into it and felt forced to complete the entire ICSE annual syllabus in like 1.5 months , mind you I was still suffering from major depression, anxiety and a whole host of other issues. Somehow I got through it, with A marks I suppose, all I got was a ""great"" from people, very good but nothing exceptional. To be honest, I did not really much care what other people thought of me then as I had one of the worst burnouts I ever experienced which I had to deal with instead (any of you who read this and think that I didn't try to get professional help, I did. Its just that my parents were reluctant to do so, mental health stigma and all that). Then COVID hit, and it gave me some years to recover from all the shit I went through, processed so many things that I never had before and then something...happened, some of my family members died and that kind of broke me, I felt dissociated and I felt like I had nowhere to turn to except my online friends from places far away, they had similar tastes as me and I could choose who I liked to talk to, I had a wider reach and more people to connect to and so it is obvious that I would find my people in there. And I did, its just that they were scattered across the globe, I came across the concept of ""giftedness"", which did not only rely on I.Q tests but also a lot of other factors like overexcitabilites (I recommend reading da browskis book on it to understand it better), twice exceptionality and hypersensitivism- all of which I could relate to.


I even discovered stuff about neurodivergency- autism, OCD, ADHD, giftedness, ASPD, introvertedness, ambivertedness and extrovertedness, etc. My mom never really liked the idea of going to a psychologist due to stigma issues (as mentioned before) so unfortunately I was not able to get diagnosed with any of them, I am hoping to go now though, soon. I resonated a lot with what people with OCD described their experiences to be like, I also talked with some of the members of the autistic community as well and I was sure all the while, to question myself at every moment, I support the idea of provisional cynicism so it was really difficult at first to confirm my doubts about it but I am pretty sure that I have it to some extent as well as OCD which- nowadays, is pretty clear from the symptoms- I will still go to a psychologist though to be conclusive about it.",0
"How to find folks to work on project together Hi,

"Dear Gifted Children, You DO NOT Owe the World Anything It took me 27 years of my life to realize that I do not owe society anything other than my taxes, following the law, and being a good civil citizen. I have been a part of numerous groups, I thought I had to ""save the world"" and do ""great things."" I realized part of it was a messiah complex, part of it was a revenge fantasy against bullies. You do not owe the world your time or energy if you don't want to give it. You do not owe anything to anyone but yourself.

"Putting things into context Hi, this is my first post and originally I wanted to talk about a different and more complex topic but I thought I'd start with a simpler question of mine:

What is even the difference in intelligence between an IQ of 130 and 180. I have no clue really, I can't really imagine what it's like to have such an abnormally high IQ. Is the difference big? Is it less than the difference between 130 and 100? 

How do people even have an IQ of 180 (or higher than that I guess)? I'm quite jealous haha. I thought after 130 the results get exceedingly rare? Like in the bell curve? And still 22 people said they have an IQ of 180+ on the vote here on this sub which seems like a lot to me.

I also heard in the US they use a 16 SD test which yields higher results for participants? So the european one would be ""worth more"" for example. I guess I shouldn't make IQ so competetive lol, in the end it's just a number and like Stephen Hawking said people who brag about it are losers or something",0
"What have you done with your giftedness? I originally did premed, went to medical school, dropped out because it turns out I'm not that great at memorizing large volumes of information and studying long hours. I then pursued computer science after some introspection, and learned to embrace my giftedness in mathematics and logic (I've won medals in national math competitions without preparation); I was able to coast through the classes and graduate with a high GPA without much effort. I then worked for a top high frequency trading firm after college. So all in all, I just took the easy way out and leaned on my strengths, although it's not really a passion of mine. I've yet to find something that I'm really passionate about as I get bored easily once I figure it out. I originally thought I loved finance and the stock market, as it obsessed me for over 5 years, but once I learned the secrets of the trade, it became a lot less interesting.

I'm interested in hearing your experiences with your special abilities, how and what you decided to do with your life, and what you've done to find your passion in life.",0
"How to manage the need for change I have always been driven by a need for change in what I do, where I live and the people I am with… the script usually runs something like find out a new interest, explore it in all its depths and dimensions, usually become good at it (start feeling comfortable with it), then lose interest and feel the need to pass onto the next thing to be explored.
While I do love this drive and curiosity about myself, it does create some difficulties when it comes to life in this world.
This pattern means rapidly exhausting a career for example… constantly changing does not put one in a very good position financially (especially since I’ve always been circling between things that require a long investment in terms of time to reach a remunerative position).
Even worse when it comes to relationships; it sounds horrible, but I am afraid of not being able to stay with someone long term (though there is a part of me that would like it) because of this need for change and new stimuli.

I guess I’m just looking for some insights from those who may have similar experiences 🙏🏻",0
"Why some gifted learners hit a wall in education - a video Wanted to share a great video that came my way this week. 

I've seen a ton of posts from gifted learners who suddenly doubt their giftedness when suddenly education goes from being really easy to really hard. This video from North West Gifted Child Association hits the nail on the head talking about [James and Susie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrvZ4fwBKU) who are two learners, one gifted and one not.

I've talked about it in a few replies to posts here, but thought it was worth sharing as I think when kids get to a certain level in secondary school or at further education, when they hit a wall and haven't experienced it they can lose momentum and not reach their potential. I see a lot of people refer to themselves as 'former gifted kids' as opposed to 'gifted adults', which is what they are!",0
"Is giftedness, in your experience, received differently than other exceptional abilities? Reading through a post in another sub where the OP stated that at an IQ of 130, a person would be the dumbest gifted person. This kicked off a whole range of comments - most of which were centered around the validity of IQ tests, and how one could erroneously think they were gifted by their result, but only because that result was BS, not administered by a psychologist, etc. I’m holding that “giftedness” isn’t so simple as a certain IQ score - for lots of reasons. 

My main point is that giftedness seems to always have an acceptance problem around it - meaning it offends people and makes them defensive. This leads to discussions about the “real” dividing line to claim that you’re gifted - like an IQ score. My son is exceptionally tall, and good at sports, and is accepted by a lot of people because of it. On the other hand, it’s my experience that giftedness has to be wrapped in bubble wrap and foam so it doesn’t make people feel bad - masking, etc. (And sure, giftedness can come with being aloof and aware of others feelings, but I really don’t think that most gifted folk are bounding about like condescending a-holes.) 

This may very well be my own experience that I’m extrapolating - so I ask the question of you all. Why does our extraordinary capability cause this type of reaction? (And I’d love to hear from folks who operate with zero cares to give AND are aware of it.)",0
"I think some people might like this I think by now most of us in this group have found that it’s mostly comprised of meta contextual questions that get repeated over and over about things like ADHD/Autism, cognitive testing, the definition of giftedness, “am I gifted” etc., and it’s severely lacking in any type of actual intellectual conversation or engaging discussions. 

Well, I think I found a group that fills that void for me. I was looking for a group made for contrarians, which is what I suppose I’ve come to see myself as, and I stumbled across r/criticaltheory . 

It’s not perfect, but there are a lot of good conversations in the group, and I’m really liking it so far, despite not agreeing with everything posted.

It really feels like a group that has surpassed the initial barrier of controversiality and unsupported statements to conversation

>Could anyone explain this translation and etymology of the word in German-and maybe provide a comment on the place of antisemitism in the 30s and transphobia in the contemporary far-right as targeting certain minorities on the basis of this apparent inability to be confined within ontological categories. This notion reminded me a bit of Zygmunt Bauman’s work in antisemitism.”

"I'm tired of trying to find where I fit I'm here because I just read a scientific article about gifted people, in another attempt to try to figure out why I never felt ""normal"".

At this point I just don't know anymore but I recognized myself in every point listed in this article

Great right? Yeah it's great in school but anywhere else it's just shit 
I always was the quiet weird kid who has trouble making friends, being the outcast without knowing why. I started smoking and drinking when I was 14 to try to fit and it quite worked but now I struggle with that too. I have overwhelming anxiety that make me unable to function some days. I review every social interaction to check if I behaved ""normally"". I have spent the whole fucking 23 years of my life wondering what was wrong with me and I just want to find out

"Gifted Children Hey guys, So my 3.5 year old daughter, is quite bright. TL;DR - Do I put her into primary school (elementary school in Australia) early? To be with peers developmentally where she is at.

She is currently doing 4 year old kindergarten (pre-school), and is thriving and so happy there. We skipped 3 year old kindergarten, as being with her biological age peers the year before negatively impacted her; she had friends yet is very social so would hide parts of herself to fit in, and was clearly bored from lack of cognitive stimulation/activities developmentally at her level. So I found a kindergarten that understood gifted children and understood wanting her to be with the older age group (she is right at the age cut-off, is 2.5 weeks 'too young', so she is just the youngest in the room by a few weeks. Where as before she was the oldest in the room and developmentally 1-2 years ahead so it wasn't great for her. Now she is able to interact with others right where she's at).

But, although the kindergarten understands, and is happy to apply for her to start primary school next year with her current peers, there has been a lot of unsolicited advice from others, saying I should have her repeat 4 year old kinder and go to school with her age group (and be always the oldest in the class as opposed to the youngest). But I personally feel that wouldn't be nice for her, and that it would be a repeat where she feels the need to dull herself to fit in, or feels 'different' and insecure in her giftedness, as opposed to feeling she belongs. I personally think children are less focused on 'age' and just see their classmates as friends in the younger years, so feel developmental age is more important in terms of placement for her. Am I wrong?

I would love your thoughts! :)",0

"Why psychology would be the best major in the apocalypse - I just spent a crap ton of time writing this on r/college, and I just want more people to be able to see it I say psychology would be the best major for the apocalypse, more specifically with a focus in social psychology.

Sure, you could do agriculture to grow food, but my guess is that you’re not in a rural area and will not have access to the modern farming tools and techniques that are taught in contemporary agricultural science. Also, anyone can figure out how to grow food without a degree.

I saw other people saying engineering. Maybe construction/structural engineering, but again, unless your degree is teaching you how to build structures out of raw materials or rubble from old buildings, it’s not happening. Also, good luck doing anything while you maintain a crutch on computers and catalogued formulae necessary for calculating structural integrity when there’s no longer anyone to run electricity and what remains of the libraries doesn’t have what you need.

Someone said medical. That’s a great point, but that’s not a major. That is a doctorate or master’s level occupation. The only thing you’re getting taught at the undergrad level includes the names of bones and muscles and how to do organic chemistry. Uhm… good luck with that when you need to suture a wound, which is something taught in medical school (sometimes but rarely nursing school). [you could also do premed as a psychology major or any major, so it’s not that useful by itself]

Someone else said chemistry. Honestly, this is the strongest contender thus far. Just from the general knowledge, you will know how to do certain things. However, having said that, most of what chemistry consists of professionally is lab work and technical skills with complex equipment. Also, I would argue that the skills you need for more complex things require graduate degrees. These  undergrad students getting 1200% errors on their lab reports are not going to do you much good when you’re trying to make a bomb to clear out debris from a collapsed building. Still useful from knowledge of chemical reactions though.

Someone else said communication. 😂 What are you going to do? Give them a speech? Use the SMRC model to what? Communicate your message about how you can help people talk to each other, all the while trying to convince people that being able to talk effectively makes you a valuable asset? All I’ll say is good luck.

Someone said physics. Just no. That’s even more useless than an engineer because it’s basically just applied math. Math is important, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not going to be that important when the world collapses. It’s very much an intellectual elite type field of study that exists just for the sake of advancing universal knowledge. That’s beautiful, but unless you’re Einstein or Marie Curie, you don’t really have anything to offer in that department, much less if you’re an undergrad.

Finally, someone said public relations. This is a terrible choice. All public relations does is maintain a good face for business conglomerates and increase public awareness of the people that pay them to do so. I promise, your social media skills will not help you in a post-internet society.

Well, now that I’ve basically just taken a massive, steaming dump on all of those other majors, why do I say psychology? Simple, you will know what to do when crap hits the fan. Knowing how people are bound to react by understanding human behavior in social situations, including how individuals respond to stress, how they form relationships, and how they make decisions could prove useful in understanding how groups of survivors might behave in a post-apocalyptic world, how to negotiate with others, and how to form alliances. Because let’s be honest. We’ve seen what happens when there is no government (Somalia). A war state is pretty much going to be inevitable, which will necessitate forming alliances. Additionally, a psychology /social psychology degree may also serve to protect you and your allies by anticipating what other people are likely to do given certain circumstances, and it will also allow you to protect against social deterioration in your own group, such as mitigating group think and paranoia that can arise in dire times. Moreover, this degree would also teach you coping mechanisms, which will be invaluable when it comes to helping both yourself and others cope with the emotional and physical trauma everyone will experience from bearing witness to the fall of civilization and the loss that comes with it. Psychology also emphasizes communication skills in an applicable way, especially for crisis situations and in times where people might not be thinking properly due to the strain put on them by the current situation. Finally, if it is a goal to rebuild society, a psychology student (but more likely a psychologist) will know how to do that- how to get people to follow and conform to rules, how to assess the wellbeing of others after the fact, etc. And one of the biggest reasons social psychology is so useful is that it does not rely on anything else other than your mind. Once you understand how to do these things, you don’t need conplex tools or technology to apply them, and this makes you irreplaceable.

Now, like with other majors, an undergrad degree might not help you as much as people with higher degrees, but when worse comes to worst, those types of people will be in short supply, and you’ll be better than nothing. And even if you are to take a backseat to a professional, you’re going to be younger, stronger, and likely more resilient than an actual psychologist.

Anyway, that’s my argument. Feel free to pick it apart where you see fit. This was really fun for me, if you couldn’t already tell!

Honorable mentions:

Any performance arts - you may not think of it at first, but people are going to want entertainment and something to boost their spirits in the dark times. Psychology can help with that, but if there is no outlet of joy, it will be a losing battle. You might not need a degree for this one though.

Anthropology (archeology)- within certain branches of anthropology, you learn how to excavate and uncover remnants of the past, and I don’t think it’s talked about enough that you are taught how to interpret what you find in terms of behavior retroactively. This could prove useful in making sense of what is left of the world, and anth also helps you adapt to new cultures, which will make adjusting easier. 

Worst majors:

Business (unless you’re rich) - you might be able to trade and sell things in exchange for other things, but it’s not like you’re going to be starting a business to do it. Anyone can do what you do.

Economics - understanding how capitalism and money works won’t aid you one iota when both of those things are no longer in motion.

Philosophy - you know a lot but not enough, and your proclivity to exaggerate the preponderance of questions and metaphysical abstractions that have no answers isn’t going to do you much good, and it’s probably going to piss people off when they can’t understand you. This also goes for English and History.

Architect - you basically offer even less than a structural engineer.

"Daughter's school wants to do eval Hi. Hopefully this is a good place to ask this. The TL;DR is: should I go through the school to have my 6.5y daughter evaluated for the gifted program since they sent home a letter asking for permission, or since our family has a history of neurodevelopmental disorders should I seek a complete evaluation through a psychologist to ensure we have the whole picture? Or both? And any other advice for us during this process?

My daughter is 6 (7 in late summer). She's in kindergarten this year. It's her 1st year of public school. We did homeschool before this, and technically did kindergarten last year with her, but felt she would benefit from doing it at public school as well. Last school year was pretty tumultuous because her older brother (8) was seriously struggling with behavior and we were in the process of getting his ADHD and ASD (Aspergers) diagnosed and the right treatments started. She wasn't quite where I expected a beginning 1st grader to be when this year began, AND her birthday is only about 1 week before the cut off anyway. She's doing amazing this year. 

We had wanted to get her started in the public school system earlier but because of covid things and the (pretty bad) virtual option from our school we continued with home school for both her and her brother. 

I also have ADHD that wasn't diagnosed until I was 30(ish) and there's a suspicion of Autism as well- based off of conversations with a behavioral psychologist, and the information/observations more recently brought to my attention from psychologists who've been working with Autistic Women/AFAB individuals for decades. However, I'm not able to get a formal evaluation at this time due to our location/ limited options for providers/ high demand for children's evaluations on the few providers within realistic travel range. 

I was also classified as a gifted child in my early elementary years. I personally found the pressure to be a lot, and as I had more expectations, deadlines, etc. placed on me things of course became more difficult and less manageable. Much of this was likely due to my undiagnosed ADHD. 

I also have noticed a fair amount of other people who similarly were diagnosed later in life with ADHD or ASD,  mentioning that they were also placed into gifted programs as children. I have seen from my very limited amount of research into this that there is the chance of both or of misdiagnosis one way or the other. I also saw a higher chance of socio-emotional struggles among gifted individuals indicated in a couple of studies. 

Adhd was already on my radar for her because of her very strong emotional reactions and sensitivity to criticism/perceived rejection etc. That is not something she shows at school, AT ALL. She also has some other behaviors that I recognize from myself- that look more like inattentiveness/executive function struggles. 

This isn't something we plan to just ignore, but I do want to see what other's opinions are about going through the school and essentially having that label put on her (and potentially all the stress that comes along with it) at this point in time. We also could pursue the full evaluation from a behavioral psychologist. We could do both. Or we could see what the doctors say and hold off on the school system for now. I'm just looking for opinions. I understand that if she is gifted it isn't going to just not exist if we don't do the evaluation. I just want to make sure we choose the right path for gaining information. 

I did also email her PCP, who's special interest is ADHD & has worked closely with psychology in the past. He recognized our other child's ASD before we did and helped guide us to the correct people for evaluations and education.",0
"Anyone else feel not gifted anymore? Really been grappling with how trauma can rewire the brain… At the end of high school, top colleges were fighting over me and I threw it away to go to a faith based school in the South.

Life has kicked my ass with a series of really shitty things and I’ve gone to therapy for years. 

But over the last couple of years I couldn’t even get interviews after months and months of endless job searching. 

I applied to grad school for a mid-life career change for what I’ve always wanted to do that would allow me to have fulfilling work, and just found out I didn’t get it. I’ll apply again on the next cycle, but it just really sucks going from having a Midas Touch to having to fight really hard for everything only to be rejected over and over and over and over and over and over and over. I didn’t get on the waitlist either.

Anyone else been here and found your way through it?",0
"WAIS profile interpretation Hello, my 18 y.o. son has received his WAIS profile.

How would you interpret this profile, especially in regard to the FSIQ?  


His verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning were both around 120, resulting in a GAI of 122 but his CPI was significantly stronger, with working memory at 135 and Processing speed 125. The FSIQ was at 130.

The subtest scores for PRI were BD with 12 SS, VP with 11 SS and MR with 16 SS. I might add that they also administered the Figure Weights subtest in which he got 15 SS and according to one study one could supplement either BD or VP with FW without loss of structural validity which would push the GAI to 125. On the other hand i'm sure there are reasons why it is administered that way by default.

I would appreciate your input very much!",0
"What kind of consulting do gifted people can do? Hello:

Typical gifted pathway - worked my ass off, kept burning out doing things for others, priotizing others (and my company) before others. Long story short - I have to re-start, and I thought of going into consulting. 

&#x200B;

Though, i struggle with how to defind myself. I thought I can ask for some advice.

&#x200B;

I have a pretty good specialization in technology - specifically looking at climate change, and architecture. Before, i was working in architeture - but focusing a lot more on sustainability, integration of innvoative technologies. But, I also was running/managing part of the firm, and picked up a lot of skill-set. 

&#x200B;

I am a polymath - but, I just do not want to work that 9 to 5 environment, or have someone who does not understsand what I am doing shout down my thoart to get things done and re-do things, etc. 

How would someone like me market myself?

One reason why I want to not limit myself to building/architecture is because I enjoy more than anything to learn about new things, and I thought to myself - why not just chose projects. I also have large projects that I want to work on - 

  
But, I suppose I need a way to bring in some income until those projects start going online. But, in the meantime - I need to market myself, and I just am curious how you would go about it.

  
Any suggestions/feedback would be appreciated.",0
"Have I missed my chance at a meaningful career? Have I missed my chance at finding meaningful work I can truly devote myself to? I'm 36. If there's still a chance, what method would you recommend me using to identify a career path?

Background: I grew up poor, in the middle of nowhere, so I gratefully jumped into the first university that gave me a scholarship. It was a bad culture fit, very under-stimulating and I didn't fit in. The guidance counselors were annoyed by my initial enthusiasms and I got no help there (""I wanted to work in a think tank too, but if I couldn't make it, there's no way you will""). Finally I got so depressed and checked-out, and I was never able to settle on a particular field of study because I had loved everything and now I loved nothing, so finally just graduated with a general social science degree. I also went to grad school at a prestigious institution, but I could never fit in and I hated the cutthroat world of prestige academia.

I eventually became a librarian because I love learning/research. But the pay and safety issues are unsustainable, so I know I've got to make a change.

Edit: One thing is I don't do well with stress/pressure. I'm a sensitive person so I also don't want to be exploited by the rat race. So I've also entertained the option of just staying in a low-level job, flying under the radar, and then having lots of time and mental space for reading, painting, writing, time in nature, etc. Is this the best path? But I hate the conflicts with my bosses who can somehow sniff out my intelligence. And I sometimes feel like a ship that just stays docked all the time.",0

"2E and wide disparities in skills I was identified as gifted when I was in high school and a somewhat recent assessment put my IQ at 138. I was assessed because I was struggling to maintain passing grades, primarily in subjects that involved literature that I wasn't interested in or math. I would often pass subjects like history with As quite easily and I was always advanced in writing and reading comprehension when I was able to maintain focus for long enough. I was diagnosed with ADHD in the 99th percentile and my parents decided against putting me on medication because in the years before I entered school, there was a lot of discussion about the overuse of stimulant medication in children and I don't exactly fault them for that. From Kindergarten to 8th grade, I was able to skate through school without ever studying and earn straight As. I was even put in a program where I helped other kids with math because it came so easily and intuitively to me. I think it was called Math Masters if I remember correctly. The issue I'm experiencing is my present inability to perform well in algebra. I started out by skipping steps, which got me into some trouble with my instructors, so I ended up losing interest. Eventually, when I came across concepts that I didn't immediately understand, I shut down. I grew to hate math as a result. I had a series of unkind math teachers who responded negatively to me struggling and it's been a common theme ever since.  


Fast forward to today, I'm a student at a community college. I have highly advanced writing and reading comprehension skills, and language in general comes extremely easily to me. I speak three languages and I'm learning a fourth, comprehension comes extremely easily to me and I'm able to intuitively draw connections between distantly related languages that are seldom obvious to most learners. I can get As in classes that involve language arts, writing and history without studying for more than fifteen to thirty minutes a week. I've gotten As on papers that I felt needed significant revision and felt like rough drafts to me. On the other hand, I had to drop my intermediate algebra class because very little of it sticks. I can understand the concepts when they're being taught and do the problems in the homework assignments with little error, but when it comes to the exams, I'm often the last one still taking it and I perform abysmally. This disparity can be confusing to me at times when I think about my overall cognitive abilities and capabilities as a student. It's also confusing to me because I used to be excellent at math but I hit a brick wall. I can multiply random three digit numbers in my head and produce correct answers but when it comes to somewhat higher level math, I often get confused about what the instructor wants me to do and all the different steps and skills I need to apply not only don't stick, they bore me to death. I often wonder why it is that I, as a person who has certain strong mathematical abilities can also struggle in high school level math.  


I should mention that my study skills are still atrocious. When it comes to math classes, I'm so uninterested that I zone out almost immediately. I hate it. I would rather drink out of a latrine than factor a fucking polynomial. There's still this part of me that feels like it should come more intuitively to me so I get frustrated with myself when it doesn't. I want to get past this mental block or whatever it may be so I'm not limited in my educational prospects to areas that don't require high level math. Is this just a limitation I should work around? Have I reached the limit of my capability in math? Is this one of those areas where I just need to learn to buckle down and study like I've never studied before?",0
"Hi, I am new. Hi everyone. I am just introducing myself for now. I am newer to Reddit. I tested Gifted in 2004 I think. I was in Kindergarten. Heard the whole story a few of us did I’m sure about being excellent, saving the world, being capable of anything… Now we aren’t doing those things.

Well I hated that. I’ve been misunderstood my whole life and I didn’t even realize it until maybe last year or so. I mean, I knew things were different and frustrating but I didn’t understand how far on another level I was operating with my emotions, thoughts, and interests.

"Is it normal to have giftedness characteristics and not have an IQ of 130 or above? Hello.  A few years ago, I took a neuropsychological exam and through explanation and discussion, I explained to my examiner that I aligned myself with many of the same characteristics that I found through my own personal research on giftedness and through reflecting on my time in school. I believe I encountered some of the same struggles. While the Forer effect might have been at play during this period of self-reflection, I found solace in finding that these characteristics I found online perhaps reflected my own, leading me to believe for a period that I found the answer to why I felt different. After the test, I found that I was not gifted but tested in the high average range and did not test highly for ADHD or ADD, but she found that I tested highly for OCD and signs of autism and schizoaffective disorder. Although I am not gifted, is it normal for someone not in that level of mental cognition to have a lot of similar characteristics? Or am I fooling myself into believing I do? I understand that some disorders like autism exhibit similar characteristics to giftedness so perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the middle.",0

"Is it too late for college ? Is this even a good reason to go ? Hello,

Like a lot of people here I've been at the ""roadblock"" where due to not having to study to score high, I never quite learned how to study, or any form of discipline or diligence whatsoever. As a result I kinda didn't do well at the end of high school and in my 2 years of college. I'm ashamed to say I don't know most things people 8 years younger than me probably know. (I'm 24 , almost 25)

Lately (read: for the past 2 years) I've been thinking about going back to college. But there are many problem's with this and I'm not sure what the correct decision is.

- I have a ""life"" where I am. I have a best friend that I love dearly. I have a job, a startup, a place to live. If I go back to college, I throw all of that away.

- I'm a software developer. I don't know how much things will have changed in 4 years. I love programming, I don't know if I can stay away from it for that long

- I have plans. Plans to buy a house. Plans with friends. Plans to learn a ton of things that require me not being in a dorm and having time to spare. Plans to travel to places. 

On top of that, the choice of university is daunting. My school of choice is St John's college. 

I've absolutely fallen in love with this school. I'm not exactly sure why, but the format of their classes is very appealing. The major turn off is that it's liberal arts. It's not a degree that will be useful or that will teach me things I want to know, rather I see it as a pathway to thinking better and learning to learn and be more disciplined.

At the same time, taking an actual curriculum on a subject I planned to learn on my own may be better...? I could go for engineering or biology or even better, physics.

And perhaps one of the biggest reason I want to go is that I feel I'm missing something. Some thing that I haven't experience yet that I need to .
I want to, for once in my life, struggle in the classes, force myself to learn, to pay attention, to improve, to strive to be the top of the class, to be in a club, to be more independent, to not have to worry about rent or work hours and just 100% fully commit on learning things. 

But as well, what if what I'm looking for is already here , and I'll only realize once so can't go back anymore ? What if I'm not missing anything? 
Has anyone experienced this ? Does anyone have this feeling that they're missing something ?",0
"can you lose your giftedness/have a wrong assessment as a child I just wanted to know if you can lose your giftedness or miss your potential if you fuck up during your childhood/teenage years. I was diagnosed with being gifted in primary school, but the older I got, the more I think I was misdiagnosed or just lost my gift. I think the only thing I am really good at is cramming knowledge into my short term memory for tests.

I am shit at logic puzzles, but I obviously was good at them as a child for me to score something up in the 99.5th percentile in official giftedness tests. How can I get more stupid the older I get? 

Academically, I am still doing well in Uni so that's not an issue, but I think academics actually have nothing to do with intelligence except blunt memorization and I am studying music (where theory is not emphasized much). It's just in everyday live I am so incapable of functioning and also incapable of thinking straight. Like a lot of people think I am really slow and a lot of the time I am ""not there"" and don't get anything and also cannot remember a lot.

TLDR:   
I'm supposed to finish my Master's thesis in April, and I don't know if I can do it. I don't want to let myself, my peers, my profs down, but I can't seem to take control of my life. If you've been in a similar situation, I would love to hear your story and words of encouragement. 

Longer version:

This gets a bit more ranty/personal. I don't know if I can consider myself gifted, but I always had an easy time learning things quickly (mainly things to do with emotional intelligence, psychology, philosophy, literature, etc.). I actually learned maths and sciences well too, but my brother excelled way more than I did (I couldn't get past the fact I was always inferior to him). It didn't help that my dad (since I can remember) attempted to teach me (us) material about 3-4 years in advance. I became completely non-responsive to doing his work, as he was a difficult teacher and often resorted to yelling at me and calling me stupid (my mom was no better). I'm a little conflicted on the ""gifted"" title because I was often considered dumb, but did well in school. 

In school, I hardly studied. I could get an A by learning everything from scratch the night before, which used to be a point of pride, but in reality it's ridiculously stressful, unsustainable, and causing me ill health. My study habits right now often follow this kind of pattern: I get the assignment, I'm overwhelmed, I feel like it's too much and I can't do anything, escapism is my friend, then the deadline comes and the anxiety of embarrassing myself outweighs the stagnation. Evidently, I never end up doing my best. And that sucks because, with this, I can't see a future for myself. I can't see myself attaining any of my goals.

Weirdly enough, if I try to do something in advance, I'm at a loss of what to do. Yet, I can clearly prioritize when there's no time left. 

I kind of feel like this is just who I am and I can't escape. I'm also ashamed of it and I feel like I should just be able to try harder and tough things out. 

PS - This is more of a side note, but I find it so interesting that my brother and I both ended up ""gifted"" (having an easy time in school (especially the case for him)) as well as went through/have similar disorders (depression, anxiety, eating disorders). 

(I am ok, by the way—I'm mostly just struggling with the escapism thing).",0
"I'm 38 and just found out I'm gifted In a very random turn of events, some old records were found by a colleague with my information on them, showing I had a gifted designation (the records were from school). I was shown them on Friday and confirmed that I was assessed as a kid and designated as gifted.

I had no idea. 

All I knew was that my parents considered skipping me ahead from K to Grade 2 but I decided that for social reasons, I wanted to stick with my friends. My mom said that the school wasn't very clear with communication (about the designation) but it appears as if I was being supported as a gifted kid, when I look back at my experiences. I have spent all weekend processing and reflecting and it all makes sense. I feel so validated and understood. It's like a whole new context to see myself in and that really excites me!

"Hold on a second…are all gifted people 2e? I say this because I thought I was ‘just’ gifted, but I have been diagnosed with ASC and I’m seeking an ADHD-I assessment. The lightbulb suddenly came on at the age of 30, after exploring giftedness and its comorbidities. My partner (also gifted) now thinks she has ADHD-I, but only recently has the penny dropped.

Are all of these conditions and traits just a result of an ‘overdeveloped’ brain, positive or negative?",0
"recomendations of books on the topic I found 2 and another one not on the topic, but I tried anyway.

Here:

\- Your rainforest mind

\- The drama of the gifted child, Alice Miller

The third one: 

\- The Geography of Genius, Eric Weiner

&#x200B;

You know, I wanted something more like The Paradox of Choice from Barry Schwarz, or The Power of Habit, Emotional Intelligence or something. Even something more technical I think would be better.

I got excessively bored on these 3. The third one isn't on the topic, so although it was funnier, it doesn't quite fit. The latter ones are on the topic, but they're just too \*I don't know the word in english for that, but it's like commiserative, something like ""oh poor baby, poor poor baby you suffered so much, your parents were bad people, but, here, let me give you a hug"". And I'm like ""just tell the information I want, please.""\*

You guys know books that talks about the topic of gifted but for not-traumatized adults? I wanted to get ideas on how to deal with the gifted situation, how it is being categorized (like if there are subcategories or are all the same), how to feed it and how to deal with it and so on.

"The Paralyzed Athlete: Living with Giftedness and Adhd Hey there, 

I’ve been gifted with a sharp mind that loves nothing more than diving deep into complex, abstract ideas. Unfortunately, I’ve also been cursed with ADHD, which makes it extremely difficult to focus and keep my mind on track. It’s like being an athlete with a strong, muscular body but being paralyzed from the waist down. I can see the finish line, but I can’t get there no matter how hard I try. 

One of the things I struggle with most is feeling like I’m not living up to my intellectual potential. I love challenging myself and pushing my brain to its limits, but ADHD often holds me back. I’ll start working on a project or reading a book, and my mind will wander off to something else entirely. It’s frustrating to know that I’m capable of so much more but can’t seem to harness my own power. 

Another big challenge is finding a career that’s both stimulating and manageable. I’ve always been interested in fields like science and philosophy, but these subjects require a lot of focus and attention to detail. Meanwhile, jobs that don’t require as much brainpower can feel boring and unfulfilling. It’s a tough balance to strike, and I often feel like I’m stuck in a rut. 

But perhaps the most painful part of living with giftedness and ADHD is feeling like an outcast. Many people see me as intelligent and capable, but they don’t see the struggles that go on behind the scenes. Meanwhile, those who are truly gifted and successful often look down on me for not being able to keep up. It’s like I’m stuck in a no-man’s land between these two worlds 

I would love to hear your struggles if you relate and i'd also love it if you could share how medication has helped.",0
"I suspect I have ADHD-I and am gifted simultaneously. What do I do? Do I do anything? I'm in my late 20's and currently going through a process of diagnosis concerning ADHD-I. Lately I have spoken to some people close to me who were 'diagnosed' (I don't know if that is the right word) with being gifted during their childhoods.

It has led me to consider I might be so as well. Now I know I can't really diagnose myself when it comes to these things so I won't go around saying that I am gifted.

But let's say I am, should I do anything with that knowledge? Should I look further into it? Or should I just leave it be as it won't really help me in any way?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",0
"Therapist Issues I’m 2E ADHD, and I’m having a really difficult time finding a therapist. I keep getting disqualified as a patient during the consultation.
I have a complex, but mostly processed background. I’m looking for a therapist who can help me with existential depression/frustration/dread. I’m very honest during the preliminary consultation, zero masking. I realize I tend to ask abstract questions when I’m not masking; but I’m just asking questions I have. And I’ve done masking with therapists, it gets me nowhere introspectively.
I’m not outraged, just at a loss for how difficult it’s been to find a compatible therapist. Has anyone else experienced this?",0
"Am I stupid or am I gifted and the others are not getting it? Hi guys,

Am I stupid or am I gifted and the others are not getting it? Look at some of the examples below and try to judge if my plans make sense.  
In general I have like 10 years of developing campaign plans. I have read 18 books with a total of 1000s of pages. I have spent 1000€ on surveys to gain a deeper understanding on certain details. In detail:  
I have insight from the books which factors explain the media reporting.   
I have insight from the books and scientific literature which factors explain how media reporting is processed in the brain to create certain opinions and how manipulation is at play. To do this, I have read into psychological concepts and conducted own research.  
I have insight from the books into the theory of planning effective campaigns. And have planned many campaigns so far (read below).

Does that make me gifted or an expert on campaigning?

&#x200B;

 **------ EXAMPLES (pick one or two at random) ------**

**Example 0: Am I gifted in math?**  
Well in School I had like straight As in Maths and Physics. Is that exceptional? For me it's normal. I then went on to study Physics, where I barely came by (scored a ""pass"" on first math exam). Well I also did not like to study hard, maybe it was that. But well I never was exceptionally gifted in comparison to other physics students.

Well then I switched to economics where I scored 15 points out of 15 point on the math course exam. It's the top 1% of economics students, which should have a higher IQ than normal. I also did an online (free) test where I scored a 130 IQ on math, but less so on other IQ topcis, so average IQ was more like 110 or so. After graduating economics bachelor I went on to work as a statistician. Combining the information, I probably am gifted in the field of mathematics but not over the top gifted?

**Maybe Asperger explains the high math IQ**  
Also I did an online test on Asperger and almost all these free Asperger test say it would be likely I have it. (except the one test where it is about recognizing emotional states in faces, I can do that). That would explain why parts of my IQ is elevated, but not all. Also would explain difficulties in relationships. But it's not terrible. I have some friends I talk to and play online games with. I have good contacts with my colleagues. I worked on my social skills. It takes some brainpower to come up with the socially appropriate response, but I think I can manage it. You have to look for clues in the faces of people, like are they looking away, looking distracted, how are they talking, and also factor in what would be a ""normal average"" response. But I don't have not so much interested in ""small talk"". But I've worked on that too, I was much less interested 7 years ago.

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 1: LGBT Youth support (fail)**  
So I have been interested in politics for a long time now. My first topic of interest was LGBT youth depression and suicide. I crunched the statistical numbers and I found out, that the problem here where I live is not that people don't think LGBT youth should not be supported. They simply were not aware of the problem. Then I found out that the problem of lacking awareness is that something like LGBT youth suicide is not really interesting in the media cycle. It is depressing and once reported loses it's newsworthy status and interest takes a nose dive. So I searched for ways to attract genuine media attention to the topic through the back door. I found out that if we combine the topic ""LGBT youth"" with ""gay soccer player"" then suddenly interest would skyrocket. This is shown by past coming outs where it was the nationwide headline in the newspapers. You would need 100s of millions of $ to replicate the attention with ads, I calculated and I think that should be the goal metric to solve the problem. But somehow I could'nt convince other organizations working on it of this? I don't think they understood the strategy? Or they were just showing narcissistic fake compassion where you pose to ""work for the good cause"" but you actually just showing off how great of a person you are and how much you ""care"". So I did it myself. I myself created one of the biggest LGBT social media channels in my country (like a few thousand followers) working with the proposed strategy. Still no one would join the effort. Also, in addition later I found an alternative way towards the objective: The relevant literature on campaigning like the Core Curriculum of the Center for applied nonviolent Actions and Strategies (Capter one ""A Vision of Tomorrow"") and Chapter 3 of activist Popovis book ""Protest"", you find out, that you need a large vision that captivates whole of society and not a special topic, that almost no one cares for. So creating an alliance to combat mobbing in general would be the right strategy, here the interest of pupil, parent, womens, LGBT, disabled, migrant organizations would converge and they could stand with a united voice to protect all our kids. Explained this to people, did'nt work either. Again: Don't they understand the underlying principles of the literature so I need to start there? I thought it would be obvious once applied and I don't need to circle back to the theory?! Or again: fake narcicisstic compassion at work? Or did I overlook something and the solution is not as great as it seems? What's wrong here?

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 2: development aid (fail)**  
Again, I was looking at the relevant literature (""poor economics"") from Nobel Literate Banerjee. Turns out development aid is incredibly ineffective. Read a bunch of other research papers (like 25 to 40) too. Goal is to prevent hunger and starvation. Solution is raising education levels. Each year of general education on average rises income enough to stop hunger if you crunched the statistical numbers (average calorie deficit, price to close calorie deficit with cheap food, % of income increase that is spent on chap food). Also health interventions (deworming meds, vaccination, breastfeeding, iron supplements) have an extremely high ROI as the preven sickness costs of 100s of dollars (meds, loss of work). You can accomplish these health interventions with health education. So new Goal is to reduce price to spread general and health education as low as possible. Current price is about 200$ per year for schooling children and basically unattainable for adults in rural settings.

So if we program an free education app, we cut down the price down to free / 0.5 dollars to spread the app. What I mean is: You can work with the school system, NGOs on the ground, stars to advertise the app for free. If you run of that strategy you can run paid ads that reach 1000 people for 0.5 Dollars. The cost to acquire and help one user is pushed down from 200$ per year to 0.5 dollar for a lifetime. Free user recommendations not even factored in. And as 45% of the population in development countries already have a smartphone and 80% will have towards the end of the decade, this means we can provide education almost for free, while the upside for people is like 100 dollars per year. So the ROI is like 1000X after 10 years. Better then everything else. 5-10X is like the standard that is considered decent. 30X is considered very great. We are at 1000X. Not saying this is easy to pull of. But should'nt we invest really serious resources to see if this is possible if the potential reward is 1000X? What am I missing here? Talked to CEO of one laptop per child program, the biggest e-learning developing aid program in the world to date. She should now. She said it's interesting. There was no criticisms from her. Only thing she said is read a book which talks about ""deschooling society"" so the only thing she said was: Be aware not to force people into rigid education rituals, but the app would be not rigid but provide the education for everyone who wants it for free.

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 3: Corona politics (fail)**  
Ok I am getting into hot water here. So during peak corona there were two sides not talking to each other: Side one: 50% of us are all going to hospital of the virus if we get the virus. We have to fight virus at all costs. Side two: The virus is not dangerous. This is just a conspiracy to enforce the Great Reset on us. No one wants the corona restrictions. This is turning into a dictatorship.   
And I was more on the camp of the restrictions were to much. But not at all in the ""great reset conspiracy camp"". So, again I crunched the numbers / statistics on this. Turn out, majority of the population was ok with the restrictions, while some wanted more and some less restrictions. And turns out that fear of the virus was actually quite widespread, explaining the wide support of the restrictions.

So, again,  I read the relevant literature on campaigning, like the Core Curriculum of the Center for applied nonviolent Actions and Strategies (Chapter one ""A Vision of Tomorrow"") and Chapter 3 of activist Popovis book ""Protest"", you find out, that you need a large vision that captivates whole of society. You are focusing on issues were everyone agrees upon to advance your course. And if you read the very first chapter of ""The Politics of Nonviolent Action"" from Gene Sharp of his 900 pages opus dei on nonviolent action you read that you need to cut off the power of the opponent at its source. The source of the power of the opponent was clearly fear.   
Combining both concepts and conducting opinion research, I figured out that the common ground was ""understanding the restrictions"". Like 80%+ wanted transparency, they wanted to understand the restrictions and have clarity when a restriction would be suspended and when it would be in place. And a majority did not understand the restrictions. So you would pick the most unpopular restriction and simply demand to explain what metric exactly was crossed that pushed the danger to far and what metric exactly needs to crossed again to lift the restriction. Not explaining this would be highly unpoplar and reduce support for the measure. Explaining this would reduce fear on both sides (fear of a corona dictatorship and of the virus) and widen the common ground of both sides. Follow up demand would be to make the crossed line metric comparable to heavy flu seasons. Not saying this would have solved everything. But saying that this is much more effective then the one side shouting ""dictatorship"" and the other ""your irresponsible"". It never got to the underlying core issue that way. Again, tried to explain this to the organisators of the corona protest. Barely got them to understand it. They half-heartetly deployed the strategy one week, but no follow up next week. Next weeks everything back to normal like ""demanding all restrictions to fall immediatly"", although the literature says that's not how you do it. You politicize a small issue that you can win to build momentum towards the big goal.  Again: Don't they understand the underlying principles of the literature so I need to start there? I thought it would be obvious once applied and I don't need to circle back to the theory?! Or did I overlook something and the solution is not as great as it seems? What's wrong here?

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 4: Help to make peace in ucraine war (fail)**  
Ok again getting into hot water here twice. So, again I was crunching the statistical data on this topic. I found out that in general public support for the actions taken by my government is above 50% (close to 50% or as high as 70%). I also found out that the reason for this is widespread fear of russia (80% having fear of Russian aggression). Again, the literature (more details in example 3) suggest not to campaign on divisive issues and cut the power of the opponent at it's source. Yet, all the peace movement does is running on divisive issues and not attacking the power sources of the opponent but interacting with the product of this power structure (the public opinion the power structure has created). I think I have asked them and they don't know about the nonviolent action literature.

It seems like in general the organizations neither have crunched the data on public support nor have read the nonviolent action literature. So they have no realistic model of the problem and no realistic model of the strategy to solve it. Are they just copying what everyone else is doing? Just following the standard template and not wasting any thoughts on what the optimum solution would be?!

Anyway, so again the rule is not to make the big end demand but make a small demand on a non-divisive point to gain momentum for the campaign. In our case this would be demanding a newspaper to apologize for the weapons of mass destruction lie. According to my survey, 95% of the population supports this. If this demand does not get met, why think a more divisive demand would? Or you could analyse an article on the ucraine war for biases with a scoring system and demand the biases to be cleared. Again, this would arouse almost no protest from the other side, as it identifies a common ground which is: There should be fair and unbiased reporting in the press. No one argues against that. If the demand is not met in private malings, you would move on to public protest. If that doesn't work, you start a boycott. Especially pushing the advertisers away from the press by boycotting advertisers  that don't obey the boycott. This can hurt the opponent extremely as they make like 50% of their revenue with ads. Risking significant parts of their business for biased reporting doesn't seem likely. Repeat until demand is met and first victory is scored. Well accurate reporting would not mean peace right away. But it would increase the likelihood and prevent additional oil added to the fire by biased media reporting.

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 5: migration politics (fail)**  
(Triple hot water.) In my country there are two sides on migration politics. One side: Let's welcome all refugees and be open and tolerant. Migration critics are nazis. Other side: No more migration this will be the end of our culture. Again, the strategy would be not to take a divisive stance but to identify common ground to advance the campaign. Turns out it's not too hard. Reading the handbook on nonviolent campaigns by war resisters international, reveals framing of your goal is important and can make a huge difference in acceptance of the goal. 

Having invested some money into a survey, I found out that when asking people if refugees should be helped near their homeland at a safe place or at our country, 70%+ say it should be near their homeland. So actually, the divisiveness goes away if you approach it right. But politicans and activists still say they are ""against migration"". Saying it this way, only 30% of the population supports you, while being in favor of helping near their homeland gets you 70%+ support. Why would you frame the issue so bad? And it gets worse: I don't want to get into detail but saying you are ""against migration"" can really easily gets you placed into the nazi category. (Which is a logical mistake as 30% of the population has that opinion and they are not all nazis.)",0
"How do you ""think/feel"" about autism and ADHD? Last year I started going to a psychiatrist to get ADHD pills, and I got an autism diagnosis, but I'm having a hard time coming with terms with these diagnoses. I'm highly skeptical about the validity of these disorders, mostly on a personal level, but sometimes even when thinking about other people.

&#x200B;

When I first went to my psychiatrist I had spent weeks learning more about ADHD and I felt like getting a diagnosis for it would really help me. As a small child I was lucky that I got stimulated by my parents and got my mind engaged, but eventually things changed and I became ""lazy"". I've always guilted myself for not actively trying harder as a teenager, so finding out about ADHD made sense and brought me temporary relief - ""it's not that I didn't try harder, my brain just didn't know better"", or something along these lines.

I never got a formal diagnosis of ADHD, I just said why I thought I had it to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me a stimulant. So I always questioned if it was ""fair"" to get the pills, if I really needed them. I eventually decided to quit it, but apparently I got way moodier than when I was on them and my life got messier. My mom had an argument with me about it and now I'm taking them again, but only when I have to make chores or do college/work stuff I find very boring.

For my autism diagnosis, I don't really ""remember"" why I decided to get it. After thinking so much about it, I deconstructed any self-convincing reasons I could have for it. An online friend of mine got a diagnosis last year, and after talking a bunch to him and making my research I thought it made sense that I'm autistic too. So I scheduled an assesment with a trusting evaluator, and she concluded I'm actually autistic in my first session, just with an interview and a questionnaire.

I got quite excited about the autism diagnosis but this feeling got quickly dilluted too. I didn't want my parents to know about this, so I didn't have anyone to tell about how I acted during my childhood other than myself during the assessment. I wouldn't say I lied when talking about it, but I also don't think I really looked and behaved as an autistic kid. The evaluator said it was fine that I didn't have someone else in my assesment because she was really sure I'm actually on the spectrum, but I don't know how to feel about this. I feel like I cheated, if this makes sense.

&#x200B;

I don't feel comfortable saying I have ADHD or that I'm autistic. I can't not see ADHD as something other than a social issue, I can't see it as a personal issue I have. I just take stimulants because they give me an advantage and it would be silly of me not to use this in my favor.

And I don't know why I should consider myself autistic, I don't have a clear reason for this or any advantage to get. I can relate to traits but I don't know how much these impact my life negatively. I'm also pretty good at social interactions, even though there's a bunch of average interaction things I ""don't comprehend"". I thought an autism diagnosis could explain my problems but I don't see how being an ""extroverted autistic"" is better than just being a ""quirky smart person"".

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm mostly just venting here and looking for peace of mind. I'd like reading about how someone here thinks of these ""disorders"" since they're strongly related to giftedness and if/how you feel comfortable with these labels, how they help you or something like this.",0
"How do you deal with frustrations with other drivers? Hi! I'm not sure if this is specifically a 'gifted' issue, but here it goes. I've had my driver's license since 2013 but I've been growing more and more frustrated with other drivers (especially since actually having a car since last year). 

I stick to the rules and try to drive as considerate as possible, while there are many drivers who don't keep enough distance, drive way too fast, don't use their blinkers, merge into my lane without enough distance (so I have to break), pass me on my right (which is not allowed here) when I keep a safe distance with the car in front of me. It causes dangerous situations and frustrates the heck out of me. 

I don't understand why people create dangerous situations and why they don't stick to the rules of the game. But getting frustrated myself is A) unpleasant for me and B) influences my driving. I know I can't change how other people drive, so I'll have to change my reaction to it. (Just to be clear, this reaction is inward/internal, I don't express this to other road users.)

Does anyone recognize this? And how do you deal with it? How do you process the feeling of frustration? Or do you distance yourself from it? Any help is very welcome! :)",0

In my harder courses like research methods, thesis, intro comsci, etc (i'm studying psychology) i struggle but work hard and get A's. in this easy course thats 99% review from 1st and second year i nearly fail my midterm. I studied with a friend and had a strong grasp on the content. I was laughing at how easy the exam questions were when i got in the exam. ironically i nearly failed. it makes no sense

its a generally easy course (i'm not the only one who thinks it's easy... everyone says its laughable) and the multiple choice was fine but gosh i struggle so much on short answer questions *all the time*. with short answer the questions are open ended and literally could be answered with so many different course concepts.

"Frustrations about misunderstanding conversations and not getting to share my thoughts I just had a quick call for a potential freelance gig in my niche that would pay big bucks. The problem is that I had difficulties understanding what the interview questions were because I have trouble processing things quickly due to being 2e.

I'm worried that my answers were off base from misunderstanding the questions. Usually the clients I've worked with just communicate over message so I don't run into this problem.

It's not just this though, it happens all the time. By the time I understand what's going on, people have moved on and I'm stuck with really good thoughts that I never had the chance to share. This time was just more high-stakes unfortunately.

I'm sure this isn't fully unique to being 2e- what do you do when a convo has moved on but you still have thoughts about it? / do you get frustrated with yourself at the possibility that you went on unrelated tangents?

"My gifted childhood friend gave up on everything and is wasting his life. I'm writing in this sub, so maybe someone can relate and have more insights or advice.

This gifted software engineer friend \[30M\] was known as the genius in high school and college, getting almost 100% grades, was a local chess champion, good-looking, very kind, and likable, and had well-paid jobs. It seems like nothing could go wrong.

Two years ago, he quit his job, saying he was ""traumatized"" and ""had enough,"" and moved back to his parent's house. This is not the first time he has quit suddenly, but he used to get another job immediately afterward. This time it was different. He depleted his savings, living off his parents now, barely going out, and not even trying to improve his condition.

He stopped meeting friends and had no girlfriend. When I asked him what are you doing in this void you are creating for yourself? He mentions books, music, hobbies, the internet, and games.

His mom called me a few times to discuss this and asked me to talk more to him. She tells me, ""if staying home makes him happy, then why not? but it doesn't make sense. I could see he's not happy,"" and she's worried he's giving up on everything and is wasting his life.

When I talk to him, he is still the same bright person, always retains his wit, and has a solid argument for everything, and it is very difficult to understand where all of this is going.

I asked his mom whether she is willing to put some healthy pressure on him, like setting a deadline or planning for him to move and force him to change and take action. She said, ""never ever would I kick my son out."" She thinks he is emotionally soft and sensitive and would suffer immensely.

Here are the main unhealthy thinking patterns that I noticed:

* He thinks therapy is a waste of time and a way to assimilate and integrate adults. He said they only care about money and partially blamed capitalism for ruining everything and hacking the greedy nature of humans.
* He tried two therapists before, and he didn't like them and described them as patronizing and superficial.
* He told me how he knew how depression screening works and could get any outcome he wanted (which I believed because he was not diagnosed). 
* He thinks most SNRI interventions are hiding the problem under the rug instead of dealing with the root causes that make people feel like shit.
* He gave up on having a corporate job; he tells me: ""you don't understand; it's painful to witness the greed, inefficiency, lies, and unreasonable decisions made daily in a corporate structure."" He mentions how he witnessed evil people and sociopaths climb the corporate ladder, and the smart ones doing the heavy lifting are barely getting by. He told me, ""I didn't wanna be one of those people.""He goes on deep theory rants that I don't remember well, but I know he reads a lot (That's all he does right now.)
* Another strange behavior was that he didn't ask for unemployment benefits or insurance even though he was easily eligible. He states that he refuses to get this help from a failed society and that they make it difficult and embarrassing on purpose to apply.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",0

"Help! Tips for a 2E kiddo?? My son is 7 and is 2E.  (Gifted with ADHD)  I am often at a loss as to how to help him get what he needs and also not go insane.

His interests have fluctuated a bit in his lifetime, but are consistently more math/science related.  He is advanced at reading but dislikes it.  If he MUST read he prefers “non fiction” books.  (I found him in bed the other day voluntarily reading a book about physics and next to him was a book about pre algebra and an Ernest Hemingway).  

His most recent interest is in engineering, which we want to encourage.  The problem is that he’s engineering things by being… well… wasteful and destructive.

And now he’s disassembling furniture to use.

I mean, I want him to thrive!  God knows he’s bored at school…he complains they’re just doing subtraction and he’s into exponents and playing with pre algebra.

"Inventors and ADHD Hey!
I was playing around with «chatGPT», and to my suprise i found out a lot of the big inventors and general inventors been speculated to have ADHD.
Tesla, Einstein, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Da Vinci, Edison, Galileo Galilei, J.K Rowling, Bill Gates, Gurdon, Pasteur, Stephen Hawking, Benjamin Franklin, Newton, Alexander the Great and a lot more people. 

Again; many of them have not been diagnosed, if any, but they displayed characteristics that are overlapping with ADHD (Rowling have been diagnosed). I’ve read a lot of articles that takes on giftedness and overexcitability, that gifted people can display a lot of ADHD-characteristics because of that + general boredom.

So What do you guys think? ADHD, overexcitability, boredom + drive and energy, just pure curiosity, high energy with a really creative side or anything else? - People with ADHD have been displayed as more creative and innovative then the general population.

If ADHD i was thinking that they had a bigger grip because of the ability to hyperfocus, their high energy, tend to be highly creative and innovative, resilience, conversational skills and spontaneity. That combined with high intellignece could make wonders.


Also, i am not really suprised, but rather sad. I didn’t get a lot of women listed, and in general listed as inventors. I Wonder How many amazing women-brains we have missed out on through out history. - (not suprised as in the way women have been viewed, treated and the gender roles that have been displayed through out history)

What’s your take? - Would like to hear😁",0
"Giftedness and 'extreme' music/art taste Hi everyone,

Gifted coming from a family of gifted persons, with highly gifted kids and so on. Working / teaching in University-like environment, well adapted although always felt like an outcast.

My question relates to music, but may be extended to art in general. In term of context, I tend to 'hook' very quickly on some subjects / intellectual challenges which often turn obsessional. Very difficult to unhook.

This is particularly true about music, where I slightly drifted from (heavy) metal to more extreme genres ( black metal, melodic BM...). I love the hidden beauty and delicateness behind this apparent wall of noise and brutality. By the way, I also absolutely love symphonic music and especially Mozart's operas.

I would like to know how frequent it is that gifted people turn to extreme forms of music and art and intellectualize the hidden beauty they find in them ?",0

"An extremely practical example of the importance of first acknowledging how the system truly works - getting a job. I'm sure many of you will remember my post from yesterday about accepting people where they actually are. Here's an extremely practical example of the importance of that (even if only for selfish reasons).

I had an initial interview which is normally conducted through an HR recruiter. Now, my resume contains amazing things for an accountant. I've automated half of my job away before. I served in the Marine Corps. I've solved problems that no one had the answer to, and no one knew who had the answers or where they could be found. Consequently, my resume looks amazing *if* you are an accountant.

This won't come as a surprise, but HR people... aren't accountants. They rely on ""Applicant Tracking Systems"" to choose resumes for them. After I gave the internal recruiter all of that information, he proceeded to ask me about things that were so basic, I would never think to mention them. After all, every accountant does a month-end close process. It's like asking a nurse if they have any experience with *looks at paper* ""patients.""

Now, here's the rub. I have really high-level accomplishments to put on my resume. If I didn't, what would my resume say? That's right! ""Performed bank reconciliations, monthly account reconciliations, variance analysis, etc."" That would get me through the HR process though, so in this case, our ingrained belief is that meritocracy leads to accomplishment, but unless you first acknowledge and focus on the system as it is, you may get passed up for a mediocre candidate because they accidentally conformed to the system better. (I'm pretty convinced that last bit happens to gifted people and neurodivergent people in general all the time.)",0

"I'm starting to think some of you guys are being so ""accepting"" that you're never really accepting people. I have quite a fascination with the behavior of neurotypical people, and I've made several posts about their behavior and my inability to cope with it. I find the replies are often mixed. I think about half of this sub reflexively stands up for people in general because they automatically think of any negative discussion as being tantamount to bullying.

Look, I'm 33 now. I didn't always have this annoyance with the inefficiency of society even though I had every reason to be. It gnaws at you over time. One thing I've learned in the last 15 years is that the step after learning known systems is to start examining systems with a lot of mythology built around them. I strongly believe that's how you go from 90th percentile to 99th percentile.

People are a really good example of this. I believe this reflexive ""standing up"" for people is inefficient. If you want to help people, you have to meet them where they are. Being unwilling to admit the extent of their faults or examine their causes is not helpful. It's tantamount to ignoring the problem.

I hesitate to put this here, but I'm becoming very disappointed in this sub. I know IQ doesn't correlate with conscientiousness extremely strongly, but in a technology-driven world, high-IQ individuals (who are usually open to experience) are the most capable of changing things. Instead, I see a complete lack of pragmatism.

What's going on here guys? I've never met a gifted person in real life like half the gifted people on this sub. Am I just missing something here?",0
"Coping with stress Does anyone have any advice as to how to cope with stress and/or psychological problems?

The general advice to cope with stress seems all so trivial and unsuitable. Regular stuff like excercising, mindfulness or specific de-stress excercises are often simplistic or counterproductive, and frankly I've tried most of it without succes. I also often clash with (mental) health professionals because they tend to use a methodic approach that seems mostly aimed at beurotypical people. When I confront them with my concerns and reasons why their suggestions don't work for me, I'm often told to 'just keep trying' or deemed 'uncooperative'.

"I'm struggling to find motivation to improve my cognition after abuse Let's just start with the point. I was severely abused as a child for 18 years. I was moderately malnourished, medically neglected, lacked an education completely (wasn't sent to school) and physically/emotionally abused daily

I'm 19, I just moved out last year and I have a tremendous amount of trauma that's manifested in mood disorders as well as possibly some more serious disorders like BPD, schizophrenia, and DID. I don't have these disorders fully but I can see there's a high chance of development because of heritability and because I'm showing prodromal symptoms.

Could these factors have severely impacted my intelligence? 

Intelligence is extremely important to me. I frequently feel motivated to take steps to cure my mental illnesses with the hopes of drastically improving cognition but in the back of my head there's a voice of impostor syndrome telling me I'm struggling cognitively because I was never particularly gifted in the first place. Maybe in the 130 range at most but not in the 150-160 range.

I don't know why I feel intuitively that I am or how to move beyond these doubts.

If I believed there were something worth restoring I'd be very motivated to do so but when I have even a glimmer of hope it's like a drop of blood in a pool of sharks

On paper, every aspect of intelligence measured by IQ tests is influenced by severe and chronic stress. I know that to some extent my IQ would be higher if I had been educated and if my brain could have developed properly instead of being on survival mode. If I didn't have to shut myself down all the time to avoid the pain of existing with the memories I have and the vicious voices of anxiety. Thing is, I'm not sure how much. 

As my mental illnesses have progressed, I've seen tangible decreases in my cognition. For example, as of last year I can't visualize images in my head even though I was able to visualize very well before that.

I don't feel that I exist most of the time. My sensory experiences fluctuate. I know I'm dealing with severe dissociation.

I know that this could affect intelligence. Because I am not certain I constantly ruminate over the possibility that it's not true


What I'm not looking for is predictable advice. ""Go to therapy"" ""take medications"" ""stop worrying so much about intelligence"" I've already considered all of these which is why I'm making this post.

If you have any knowledge on 
a) the effects of severe stress on intelligence 
b) evidence that scores/intelligence can or cannot change drastically 
c) personal experience with this 
d) genuinely helpful methods of dealing with impostor syndrome and pathological self doubt

It would genuinely help me so much. Thanks for taking the time to read this",0

"I cannot cope with the neurotypical need for patterns and rituals. I've realized this is a major issue in my life. Nothing makes me more angry than this. There are a series of rituals in society, and neurotypicals cannot cope when they see any departure from the pattern they're used to. I assume this is common to gifted people, but I see the ritual and the purpose of the ritual, and I can depart from the ritual easily to better address the purpose using another method.

One example is renting an apartment in a new city. They have two-pet limits and don't see the underlying issue of preventing animal hoarding and being a disturbance to your neighbors. They also need to see two recent paystubs. I took a sabbatical, so they have trouble seeing an income of $90,000 as being able to pay the rent on a place that would otherwise require $40,000. Some places will take a bank account balance, but they want you to have $25,000 in the account. Here's the crazy part - they won't even take all six months' worth of rent upfront in many cases. I say again, some places have concerns even when I pay them the entire balance of the lease upfront. I am, however, allowed to use paystubs from a job I obviously won't have when I move, and since I have three pets, most people are just telling me to lie about how many animals I have.

Another example is that a tree fell in my backyard and is resting on a neighbor's powerline. I put in an emergency ticket. The representative didn't understand how it was an emergency since the line hadn't actually fallen yet.",0
"Choosing a school for my 5 year old. Hello everyone!

My 5 year old absolutely loves Math and is doing extremely well doing high number multiplication. Thanks to advice from this group, she's being doing Beast Academy and really enjoys it! 

We live in Calgary and Kindergarten is not mandatory. She's currently in Montessori and will start Grade 1 in the fall.

Unfortunately, the public schools where we live  don't offer any support/challenges for gifted kids.

We applied to a public charter school for gifted children, and she's been preselected. We'll find out at the end of the month if she gets in. The downside is that many kids have also an underlying code besides their giftedness (ADD, ADHD or on the spectrum), which I worry might impact her learning and making friends.

We also applied to French Immersion, and she did get in. It's a great school and as much as I like her to learn a second language, I'm afraid it will impact her Math as it's taught in French (she doesn't know any).

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thank you.",0
"Anyone took a leap into being an entrepreneur / consultant or doing their own thing?

"Online Schooling I've been incubating this idea for a while, and I'm curious on real thoughts, especially after reading a number of posts on here. If you're currently a parent of a gifted child, I'd love your feedback!

I would love to see an online gifted school for kids who don't fit the ""mold"" of public education. I know so many parents of gifted kids who homeschool or move to another state to get an adequate education for their child. This would be an option for those families.

Anyone who has worked with gifted kids knows they have unique needs. I would love to see a school that does these things:
1. Has a specific executive functioning/social-emotional aspect, targeted to gifted kids' needs
2. Creates a community for parents and families to connect
3. Gives students a chance to work at their pace and excel as far as they need to 
4. Groups students by ability, not age
5. Pairs the best educators with adequate training in working with gifted kids with the students who need it
6. Allows students to work on passion projects

My questions for all of you...
1. How comfortable would you be with your student attending synchronous online courses?
2. Have you considered or are you homeschooling because of lack of resources?
3. What things would you want to see?
4. Would you want classes on just one or two subjects, or a full day curriculum?

"Question regarding moving my gifted child to a different school Hello, been lurking for a while. Found out last year our (3rd grade 8yo) son is gifted. We knew his whole life he was different, but just though he was ""smart"". Long story short, he's hopped between 2 schools and 1 year of Covid homeschooling. He has made some friends at his current school, but is absolutely not challenged academically. We've supplemented his schooling with coding, robotics, the Johns Hopkins CTY program, etc.. We found out last week and academy that normally only takes middle/high schoolers would be opening up to his grade next year, and are waiting to hear about acceptance.

"Talk to me about asynchronous development in young kids My possibly gifted but untested Kindergartener (almost age 6) is having a really rough year so far and we’ve been trying to find ways to best support them. 

We think they may be gifted for a few reasons both related to how advanced they are academically but also they’re very advanced verbally and have been asking really interesting questions since before age 2. For example they started asking questions and having conversations about what happens when you die around age 2.5. They can read books at a level which is more typical of 1st/2nd grade. Adults have often commented to us about their unusual precociousness. Both me and my spouse were in gifted programs and academically advanced throughout school and college so it’s not too surprising.   

Behaviorally though, the year has been a struggle. They struggle a lot with outbursts, since they often have ideas while the teacher is talking and they tend to be impulsive about shouting them out. They’re also not great at respecting classmates’ physical space. The phrase  “class clown” has been floated around as sometimes they get a bit out of control and start looking for more attention. The teacher has also said they aren’t as good at navigating social conflict as peers.

Together, these issues have led to a lot of problems because they’re complaining about being so bored and being more fidgety as a result. They hate “school math” and this has been the worst behavior time because they’re ahead and it moves too slowly. We got Beast Academy at home and they love that. 

All of this is making me feel like school isn’t designed for my kid. Their self confidence has started to be impacted and I’m not sure if we should consider this asynchronous development as part of giftedness or not. Will it even out? Do we need a different school environment? Should I be so worried?

Edit: The reason we worry about their self esteem is the school is big on their behavior point system and they are often sent to the principal’s office to chat. They like talking to the principal but don’t like being obviously “in trouble” all the time.",0
"Best countries for the gifted For context I’m bringing up gender and ethnicity, only because if people react badly to gifted men, it feels as though these attributes worsen being able to climb up in society to a place where I can gain autonomy.

I live in Asia where it’s relatively patriarchical, we don’t have as strong of a feminist culture here but women for the most part are treated well in the workplace (just maybe more invisible / favours pleasant, agreeable women).

I’ve also lived in the States briefly where feminism / diversity narrative is very strong outwardly but as a foreigner and Asian, again I feel invisible or people stare as though I have two heads when they find out my personality doesn’t suit my gentle image.

I’ve tested for giftedness across different channels, and am also possibly on the spectrum but I don’t want to find out because the information to me is useless and doesn’t remove my challenges.

I’m thinking of moving abroad, after a few failed workplaces. Where would be a good country or workplace situations or jobs where a gifted, highly pragmatic, “speaks literally / speaks their mind”, non-caucasian woman might thrive?

I’m also highly disagreeable, not on purpose, but because I often see from A to Z faster and am talking about Z when some people are still talking about J. This is not bragging (I thought I was delusional earlier on) but only believed in myself when I achieved results multiple times.

"how to figure out giftedness besides regular IQ testing? is there a standardized procedure to figure out giftedness? an official giftedness magistry™ that decides that? 🤔

I don't consider myself gifted, I think I'm above average, with very strong competences in some areas, but people who are gifted keep pointing out they think I'm too.

I don't come from a family where giftedness was a thing. working class parents, alcoholism, abuse, that sort of thing.

\- I start many projects, but finish almost none.   
\- When I find something really interesting I become hyperfocused and obsessed. I can devour difficult books in a few evenings if I find it interesting. But the moment something bores me, I find it extremely hard to focus on it, understand it or motivate myself to do/study it.   
\- I think way too much and then I start thinking about my thinking ... My thoughts distract me a lot and consume all mu energy.   
\- I hate small talk. I can do it, perfectly even, because I adapted. But it exhausts and bores me. But deep conversations give me energy. I can dive deep into a conversation much quicker than people appreciate.   
\- I'm that irritating 'I told you so' person: I see what's wrong long before others see it and am 90% of the times confirmed in what I foresaw.   
\- I love learning, I'm an autodidact, but I have difficulties learning something that someone else has imposed on me. When something \*must\* be done, I loose interest. It's got to do with not accepting authoroty that easily.  
\- As a kid I did very well at (primary) school, I understood things faster than others and my level of reading was top 3 in the class. But I lost motivation to study when I started high school, my results started to drop and I had to change schools eventually to follow a course of a lower level. There were no courses that I found interesting enough to really want to work for it. And the fact that maths was so important in E-ve-ry course was very demotivating.   
\- I adapt other people's emotions and find it difficult to hold my sense of self in a bigger group.  
\- I feel as if I'm talented and gifted in things that aren't appreciated in our society: high EQ, intrapersonal intelligence, philosophical thinking, creativity. But not in the things that are highly valued as rational thinking, mathematics ...

When I read about giftedness I recognize myself a lot. But the problem is, I've done an IQ-test (WAIS-IV-NL) a few months back and my result was 116. Far from 130. On some level this score feels right as I don't think I'm that smart and I was very motivated for the test. On another level: I didn't answer some questions because I was afraid I'd be wrong. As a hypthetical example: 'How big is the moon?' I don't know that exactly, so I passed, but later learned that saying something as 'It has a diameter of a few thousands of kilometers' would've been right. And I'm also not a quick thinker, I need my time. But the psychologist that took my test was impressed how far I got on some questions. I feel that being slow has influenced my result. Also: there were a few questions that I believed to be difficult so I started thinking about it wrong and after sometime realised: 'Oh no, I'm totally misinterpeting this! I'ts simpler than what I'm doing!' But then the time was up. And these things frustrate me, honestly. 

Idk what to do or think right now anymore. These IQ results are now holding me back from believing I could be gifted, even though I recognize myself in it. I feel I could cry. I feel so lost ...   
Have others had this experience? Or are there others with some insights for me? Things I'm not seeing? Is taking a second IQ-test a good idea? Useless? Not 'fair' since I've done it before? 

I'm so sorry this post is so long, sorry for grammar mistakes (English isn't my first language), sorry if it's a bit incoherent ...",0
"Gifted child worrying too much about what friends think of her. How to encourage her to be confident? My second grader is lately obsessed about her friends, she joined gifted school this year and since being in this environment rather than leaning into the freedom to express herself in progressive-project-based learning school setting she has become less confident about herself. Teachers are sharing feedback around her always wanting to say or do what her two other friends want. To the extent she shuts down in group setting. She was a confident vocal (voice my opinion) type kid in old school. Now she is constantly worried about “how can I draw as good as this person?” “My thoughts/work are not as good as my friends work” “I will copy the work from my friends sheet as mine might not be perfect” she is losing sight of what is expected from her and thinks about what others think. She has even recently been involved in behaviors that is not “her” she knows it’s not right choice but would do it so her friend wont feel bad. 

I know gifted or not, child or as adults we struggle to find our voice in new settings. But how do I ensure my child doesn’t lose sight of how wonderful she is and be more confident in school? She is totally different person at home. We as parents use positive feedback more often and celebrate her personality at home all the time.",0
"Gifted child... how can I help him Hi all, I hate posting things like this because I feel 'show-offy' in any mother groups. 
But my beautiful 5 year old was just diagnosed with adhd by a behavioural paediatrician and giftedness (we are waiting to do the official diagnostic test until he is on appropriate medication for his adhd). 
I am not gifted, but my husband, his father was deemed gifted as a child (and also starting grief counselling seling due to the death of a sibling, and moving country - USA to NZ) 
I see so many posts about 'being the gifted kid and now an anxious adult' and we really want to nurture my son without putting that pressure on him. 
He is 5 and loves to read chapter books (james and the giant peach, Charlie and the chocolate factory, charlottes web... ) 
And knows his timestables up to 13x13. 
BUT while he excels in stem and reading, he also forgets to put his pants on sometimes - so you know, he's also a typical 5 year old!

I digress. 

How can I help him? What do you wish your parents did to help you? What should I NOT do? 

He's a sweet little boy with a wicked sense of humour. 

Also please be nice, I'm not trying to show off, nor do I think he is any more special than any other child. I'm just looking for guidance.",0
"Can experiencing nostalgia very intensely be a form of overexcitability? It's the one thing that I could never put my finger on. Other people don't seem to experience it and it's not part of any mental illness/disorder (I mean why would it be). I remember when I was little, probably around 10yo I was in bed thinking about the past and how I missed it and suddenly just started crying. I don't think I could describe it as nostalgia back then but that's what it was. So it's not anything new either. 

I do experience it just thinking about the past, usually when I'm in the right mood, like a melancholic one. But music is what really induces it. And more specifically, music I used to listen to a long time ago, typically the more time has past the stronger the nostalgia. I also save memories in music in a way. I know this isn't uncommon but to the degree I do it may well be. There are many many songs that take me back to a very specific moment in the past when I listened to the song. 
Along with what I can only describe as an overwhelming feeling of bitter-sweetness. 

Can anyone relate lol?",0
"Inching at a snail's pace I'm 23 years old, and I'm faced with some very tough decisions. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and I recently found out I was gifted. I've spent my adult life jumping from one fixation to another, going to school off and on, and fighting through seemingly one adverse experience to another. After surviving multiple years of domestic violence and getting clean from several substances, I spent 1.5 years recovering from prolonged trauma and I find myself at a fork in the road. There exists a multitude of paths, each with their own eventual splits. The possibilities are endless and it is daunting. The troube I'm experiencing is the fact that I'm no longer fresh out of high school and I've experienced first-hand what the world has to offer, and how merciless it can truly be, and I'm terrified. I'm no longer the naive 18 year old kid filled with excitement about the possibilities of life. 


I have posted in here before about my social alienation and come away with valuable insight, and I'm in a better place in that regard. I have a girlfriend who is similar to me in many ways and happens to be highly gifted, more so than me. We have interesting conversations, we exchange ideas, and best of all, we can coexist, with her working on tech-related projects and me studying languages, writing and doing other activities I enjoy. I'm slowly forming connections with others and it's both rewarding and enlightening. 


However, when it comes to choosing a path in college, I'm stuck. I have to consider to some degree what my financial situation will look like going down a particular path and most of my strengths aren't conducive to reaching the goal of financial security. I also need to take time into consideration. 


Where my strengths lie, I could very easily excel in something like history, linguistics, or a language in particular. I've grown quite accustomed to Slavic languages, which may be of some use somewhere. I've also always excelled in writing, whether it's fiction or merely the ability to express my thoughts and ideas clearly and in specific detail. However, I'm not certain what I can do with that if I expect to have any sense of financial security in the future. I also have a strong interest in psychology and I've considered going down that path, focusing specifically on working with underprivileged LGBTQ people. Perhaps I could work at an LGBT center. 


Being concerned with time, I've also considered starting a web development program at my local city college. I have absolutely no background in it, but you start with beginner level courses and the program is rather short and provides career counselling and assistance. 


There is so much I can do and I feel like I'm just hemorrhaging time I could be devoting towards a particular skill or vocation. I'm just stuck on what I should do. Has anyone else encountered this and pulled through? If so, how did you manage to do it?",0
"Does anyone else here only recognize their own giftedness in moments of alienation? I am a 58 y.o. female, retired academic. My husband is a not-yet retired academic and almost all of my friends have higher degrees and are bright and successful. After spending my 30s and 40s chasing career success, I belatedly realized that happiness is all about relationships. So I cherish my relationships. And I am generally happy where I am.   
I do not go around thinking I am gifted. In fact, I hardly ever think about it. I just try to live every day in the most fulfilling and helpful way possible. But every so often I walk face first into an invisible wall that seems to separate me from others, an invisible wall of something that I think is giftedness that makes me realize that I am really different than others, usually in a kind of depressing, lonely way. 

Fortunately, this doesn’t happen to me very often. Maybe those who are more gifted experience it more than I do. If so, I’m sorry. 

Example: About five years ago, I came down with the flu and was quite sick. High fever, chills, fatigue, weakness. All that. Basically stuck in bed all day. So, to entertain myself I spent hours learning Kanji characters (I didn’t decide just then to study Japanese. I had been teaching myself for a month or two (around a trip to Japan)). 

My husband, seeing me in bed with a fever and a bunch of Japanese-English language books and learning tools strewn about, said: “Why are you working so hard when you are sick!? Take it easy! You can just watch a movie or something.”   


But I explained to him that I  prefered working on my Japanese to watching a movie, however entertaining that movie might be. And he kept on with the “don’t be a workaholic, take it easy” thing. And I kept trying to explain: Of all the possible things that were in my power to do that day, learning Japanese was the most fun and the most relaxing thing I could think of. Way more fun and way more relaxing for me than watching some comedies on Netflix, for example.   


Anyway, I am not sure he ever completely understood. And this is my husband! Another academic!   


I was going to give other examples, including what just happened to me tonight, but I am too disheartened now, so I will leave the floor to others …",0

"Jack of all trades, master of none I decided to write down all the past interests of mine that I could remember just to see if a pattern I noticed was true. And man not only was it true but I had no idea I've gone through so many different hobbies/phases. Dozens upon dozens of them. To call it a wide range of interests would be an understatement. 

I tend to get bored of things and move on really quickly and the pattern is that I lose interest in almost all of them due to some kind of an obstacle that prevents me from advancing or exploring the topic at a pace I would like to. That obstacle might be lack of necessary tools/materials, lack of challenge or unclear progression (last two usually go hand in hand).

This is probably in large part due to my ADHD (and possibly ASD, waiting for assessment), when something sparks my interest I usually delve into it very deeply and research it thoroughly. And because of this rapid progression I inevitably hit a wall at some point where I either lack material resources or insight as to what the next step in learning is (majority is the former though). This was either not the case or somehow counteracted in all my hobbies that lasted especially long. In the future I'll try to consciously plan out the progression to be more gradual & clear and make sure that I have all the resources I need beforehand. While likely pursuing more things simultaneously to make up for it.",0

"Frustration at seeing so many options w/ tasks I work in a creative capacity for a non-profit. I’m constantly given broad briefs and find this very frustrating. Not because it stifles my creativity but I realized today after receiving the feedback I did too much and went too far that it’s a ‘me’ issue.

Basically I realized that the instructions are broad because average people see that as clear — there’s one outcome to what they’re saying. For me, there’s many outcomes and options, and it’s hard for me to discern which one best aligns with what I see as a very broad brief.

"I strongly relate to the characteristics of ""giftedness"" and feel like it explains so much. How do I talk to mental health professionals about it and not sound full of myself?

I used this factor analysis of overexcitabilities to mark the items I relate to just so you know what I'm talking about.

I'm still waiting for my autism spectrum assessment (which is in a month) to know what is really going on here but I'm quite confident it's either one of these two or both, I mean it has to be. But of course I don't actually know yet whether gifted is the explanation. I've done a bunch of leaked professional and semi-professional tests and I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that I'm in the 130-140 range. It's not like I expected it either, I genuinely had never considered myself more than slightly above average and my academic performance mostly reflected that. 

The thing is, the term ""gifted"" already sounds bad enough in English but in my home country there isn't even such a concept nor is there awareness of it. The closest alternative is ""bright"" but that's just silly. I can't just suddenly go ""hey, btw I think I have a very high iq"", like come on...

I guess if it does turn out I'm correct about this then I can just show my SB5 report and start from there. But I'm so tired of waiting for answers at this point and I want to at least discuss that possibility",0
"creating the first IEP - what normally goes into one? Our son has been identified as gifted after scoring very high on the CCAT7 and then WISC tests. He was offered a position at a gifted school because he meets the criteria, but every teacher, admin and counselor we spoke with said it isn't always necessary or worth ""uprooting"" a student who's in a good spot. He has lots of friends, supportive teachers and the only real negative we can see is that he's not challenged enough in class. Granted this is the 3rd grade.

So we've been told by everyone to make an IEP but I honestly have no idea what to put into one for a gifted but otherwise completely normal kid. I understand that some accommodation needs to be made for 2E kids. I also know that many IEPs are made for kids with other exceptionalities but none of that applies here.

To note, the school doesn't have a spec. Ed teacher who could pull gifted kids out of class for an afternoon per week. It sound like there are a few older gifted kids and they are in their regular classes.

So what should I be asking for in an IEP when special accommodations aren't needed, or even available?",0

"4year old bored at school Reposting this from parenting, 

How do I support my child when she complains about things being too easy at school? Initially I took it as kids just saying kids things but it gets to a point that she says it almost everyday. 

She is 4 years old, reading chapter books and doing maths more advanced than her age. She picks up reading when we read to her but we have no idea where she learns maths from. I have no plans to move her up a year but wondering what can I do so that she won't lose interest in learning. She is getting restless and shouts 'too easy' when teacher asks questions. She also goes around the class telling kids their work mistakes after she finishes hers. I would like her to stay humble, able to handle boredom and at the same time remain inquisive at school. 

How can I support her at home or is there anything the teachers at school can do? 

Also, we suspected she has adhd and plan to get her assessed when she is 5. She doesn't play with her classmates, couldn't relate to their super hero/princess obsession. Teachers at school said that she is very well behaved at school, when she is at home she couldn't sit still and she is always on the go.

"I'm progressively becoming dumber and dumber each and everyday. Help. So I was a very smart kid back then. I was a topnotcher since kinder and even graduated as valedictorian in elementary. And then high school came. I got into STEP  and still got good grades but I wasn't at the top anymore. At first, I was devastated. I was so used to being the best kid in school and it shattered my ego and everything. High school marked the start of my procrastination as well as my depression. But despite it all, I still could keep up with everyone in my class. Senior High, I got into STEM. I still got fairly good grades too, considering it was during the pandemic. But my mental health got worse quickly and I started to lose my motivation to study. But I still grafuated with honours, although I would prefer to have graduated with high honours, especially because almost all of my friends did. AND THEN COLLEGE FUCKING CAME. My mental health is the worst (so far...) and I even attempted to take my own life once or twice. College showed me how fucking stupid I really am. I really have no idea why I thought Civil Engineering would be the best course for me. Calculus kills me everytime I even think about it. I go to school everyday feeling ashamed of myself. It's finals season this week and all the tests I've taken so far have been less than satisfying. I've studied a lot and memorised way too many shit only to find out that 75% of what I studied weren't included in the tests. I AM SO FRUSTRATED I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I really miss the times when I could ace my tests without even trying. Nowadays, I could give my all and it would not pay off.

"Here is how i want to help gifted people and some of my story on OWNING and discovering my own giftedness  This is copied from my Gifted Adult Meetup Group: 

The purpose of this group is to fill a much need gap in society; to create a space where gifted adults of all genders, ages and sexualities can catch up and have meaningful conversations and experiences.

Being gifted can be an extremely isolating experience when no one understands what you are going through, how i is hard to fit into the work force and even find a partner or even relate to a psychologist.

You may not be able discuss your ideas about what you are working on with others or get tired of trying to explain why you do things differently - which is usually pretty much everything!

But take heart there IS a way to thrive and meet other like- minded people and this catch up is one of them.  
You don't need a diganosis, you can be self identified. And if you aren't sure, come along and if it feels like home, it is.

The events will be a combination of free chats maybe a small fee if we are booking a venue or getting a coffee/ meal and there will be some paid masterclasses where i will be covering different topics on giftedness. I will mix it up with in person and online events too.  
But, I am SOOOO open to suggestions about what you would like!! Whether it be a puzzle solving day or a group chat on a specific topic I'd love to know.

My Story

I never knew i was gifted as a child or adult until a few life events happened that made me wake up. As a child i was moved to a private school in year 5 as the work at the normal school was too easy. As a young adult I did a masters degree and became a psychologist. All good. Married a really smart guy. Then after a few years i just started becoming mind numbingly bored with everything. Why? i'd outgrown it and needed a new challenge. So, i wrote a book on perfectionism, people loved it. I went on TV in America. I created life coaching programs. Then my marriage ended. I started dating. I couldn't find any one i could relate to dating. No one. Couldn't find a job I liked. Got stuck. Everything i tried to do i felt trapped by the rules and constraints. Even in academia i felt like my art and creativity was being surpressed when i went back to do a design degree. I was depressed. I did a lot of therapy, and why was it my clients were getting better but i was still stuck, even though I'd healed a lot of my family of origin stuff. There was something else going on. Yes a mid life crisis true. Then one day i met some women on facebook that were gifted and i totally resonated, it opened up a whole never avenue of identity that I hadn't owned. It was still hard to own it because how dare i ever feel good about myself! i had so much shame around doing that. But i realised i would never be happy until i did. So, i had to say fuck what others think I'm brilliant. And I'm here to help humanity in a big way. Next hurdle overcoming the pressure of that sense of responsibility and stop sitting paralysed in my room for months on end. Just take one step at a time people, your dreams will materialize... My next idea is to do a documentary on giftedness....Can't wait. I made the below video a while ago. I dont know if i am autistic, I was assessed as not being. but I'm not sure it was accurate.",0
"Is What I am Experiencing Normal? Hi everyone. I've been having trouble trying to determine whether what I've been experiencing for the past few years is normal, and I thought I could post something on this subreddit looking for answers.

Just to preface, I am now in first year of University.

I was assessed and classified as gifted back in grade 3 and then ended up transferring to a gifted program at a different school in my city. I stayed there for 2 years, and I liked it, but I ended up having to switch back to a regular public school as my family moved. I've always struggled with my attention span (in the process of getting tested for adhd which I 100% think I have), but I've noticed that I don't think as differently/hard as I did when I was in the gifted program at school. I get good grades in comparison to others, but I miss having a challenge. 

I'm honestly just not sure if this is normal... Is it possible to lose your giftedness? Or am I just not getting the proper content that pushed me as hard as I was pushed in the gifted program?

"Can you guys explain to me how/why giftedness is a neurodivergence? Edit to clear up some confusion, so it turns out I had just misread/misinterpreted the rule, it doesn't say that giftedness isn't neurodivergent. Just wanted to clear that up

Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit, though I'm not new to neurodivergent communities. I was tested gifted (iq 134 I think) at age 5 so yeah, hello

So anyway I was reading the rules and a few of the faqs and have determined that giftedness is considered a neurodivergence in these parts. The thing is, on a different subreddit (not naming it to get around rule 7 just in case), the rules state specifically that giftedness is not a neurodivergence. I would ask over there why it's not, how they arrived at that conclusion, but I'm not sure if mentioning iq is allowed over there. 

Btw I'm not trying to imply giftedness isn't a type of neurodivergence, I'm just saying I've seen 2 directly contradictory sources of information and wanted to ask because I genuinely don't know. Most of what i see on the internet implies that it is but I want to know what makes that the case y'know?

"Building a Gifted Program @ K-12 School I posted this on a different subreddit but got no responses so I'm hoping that this one will be more appropriate and will get some responses and ideas. 

tl;dr: We're planning on starting functional gifted services at the K-12 school I work at in Florida. How do we do it?

I work at a K-12 charter school in Florida. We have a couple of dozen gifted students but currently do not provide gifted services. The plan is to change this for next school year so we need to create (or purchase) a gifted program so we can start servicing the students.

I am currently working under the impression that I'll be a department of one and if it's not full-time, I have enough certifications that they will find other things for me to do that will make it a full-time position.

What do I need to know about doing this? How are programs typically set up when you have to meet with such a wide range of ages and abilities and interests? What services are typically provided? How long and how often would I be meeting with the students? This will likely be a pull-out program rather than a push-in program, but nothing is set in stone so if you can provide arguments in favor of one over the other, I am all ears!

Please also answer the questions that I should be asking but aren't. I'm not even entirely sure what questions I should be asking.

I'm currently in school for herbalism so I'll only have to freelance for a few more years in theory.

(Side note- all I can think about is herbalism when I'm bored while writing. I just want to be studying and making new teas and infusions. I don't want to be writing stupid articles just to rank.)

I'm sick of crying and losing money over these simple articles. I've worked seemingly ""boring"" and ""easy"" jobs in the past but I was always outside and able to listen to podcasts so I had a great time.

I put ""easy"" in quotes because it's all subjective and I don't want to talk down on assignments that pay my bills and allow me to provide for my family, or on a client who has treated me very well. Some of his assignments are right up my alley, but recently I got a HUGE order that makes me want to bang my head against the wall.

Any advice?

"Gifted Meetup and Masterclasses Hi all i have been working with a coach for the last year on how to live joyously and well as a gifted person..  I know there is hardly anything like this out there to support us,  so i have started a Meetup group for the gifted adult.  I will run some online trainings, at reasonable costs through this Meetup.

 If you are interested in me covering a particular topic please let me know.  In the mean time click this link to join  [The Gifted Adult Meetup (Melbourne, Australia) | Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/the-gifted-adult-social-group/)  and please put in your time zone. I am thinking I will run them in EST time zone.   Issues could be - how do i cope with my gifted child's needs, How do i find people i can relate to? Anything to do with differential diagnosis re autism adhd (I am a retired psychologist btw) neurodiversity, how do i deal with anxiety, the pressure to fit into normal society and more....",0
"Thoughts about physical exercise and possible ADHD? Hi all, 

I am a 28yo(F) and I am encountering some problems in which I am not entirely sure what is the cause or the sollution.

So, for about two years now I believe I am gifted: I show almost every sign from a very young age (ranging from extreme eagerness to learn, boredom in school to intense emotions, large vocabulary etc). It is just quite expensive to let me be tested and I am also a bit nervous to do so. However, I still plan to get officially tested within 2 years, because I think it will help me with accepting the way things are in my life.

This is where I would like to hear your thoughts on:
My brother has been tested at a young age and was diagnosed with PDD-NOS(autism) and ADHD. He had done everything in his power to make my life miserable, causing severe childhood trauma, from which I am still recovering (luckily I am quite far in the process). Due to his problems, i was preventively sent for autism/ADHD tests as well. These tests came back negative and I was not tested for giftedness. My school also did not want to check for it when I was about 7 or 8, since my readings skills were behind (that turned out a medical issue, nothing to due with my intelligence).

My mother has always been very dismissive in a really toxic way about exercise and I was extemely tense since my brother was harassing me all day. I became quiet and I never really dared to express myself physically (singing, running, existing). On top of that, my medical issue (not having the right kind of glasses) caused extreme headaches while doing exercise and everyone laughed at me because I was a sports disaster due to being unable to estimate angles where things like a football were coming from. Now with the right glasses, I still can't get myself to the physical exercise, even though my head is racing all day and I feel like I have far, FAR to much energy.

Sometimes I am wondering if I might struggle with ADHD as well, but that would contradict my earlier diagnosis and it seems not really fitting since I had no learning problems with school: I have been in an almost constant hyperfixation-mode until the end of high school. Then I collapsed from the abuse and everything became too much.

So, i spent the years working on becoming a more healthy person, but I still feel haunted still in terms of doing exercise like biking, going to the gym, etc.  I really want to learn how to channel my energy, without feeling extremely miserable. 

So my questions are:
1) Side question: Are there more people with giftedness and ADHD experiencing this (read: would it be interesting to find out whether I could have ADHD or not?)
2) Main question: What are your thoughts about doing exercises and what helps you to make that work for you?",0
"Any one else feel this way? When I am very interested in something, every other subject loses its gravity. No matter how bored I am, I can always pull out a book or go to a website and read about physiology. I can study other things, but they often feel like side quests. I want to have knowledge in several areas. However, it’s such an effort not to think about physiology when reading about other subjects.
Like in math, I will get bored and start thinking about what is going on in my mind, like what brain circuits I am using while being bored and what neurochemicals are active at that moment. Then the questions spiral out of control until I follow up on one that I attempted to satisfy. The craving for knowledge on this subject is almost addictive. I am ADHD and medicated, just so you know. Feel free to give any tips or advice.",0
"Advice for Younger Gifted People and Education This is advice that would have made my life easier a few months ago. I was the kid in high school that rarely (if ever) studied, and I finished in the top ten of my class. I never learned techniques to study, and that ended up hurting me after graduation.   


My freshman year of college was pretty easy for me academically. Then, bam! The first semester of my sophomore year rolled around, and it hit me like a truck. I had a 1.8 GPA the first marking period! I buckled down, and I realized that I needed to change my habits. What helped me was putting a larger emphasis on my homework; I didn't even know there was a different way of doing it. Instead of doing the homework to get it done, I did it to learn the material. If something in class wasn't super clear, I read a book about the theories on my own time. If I wasn't getting it, I also reached out to professors and friends for help. I finished out the semester with a 2.4 GPA, and I increased all of my grades except for one. It was my hardest semester, but it was also the most rewarding. What I recommend doing is teaching yourself how to learn before you are forced to do so by the difficulty of your courses.   


Let me know if any of y'all have any other questions! I'm happy to help when and where I can.   


(For context, I attend a university that is more rigorous than most, I am currently in my second semester of sophomore year, and in kindergarten, I tested at a little less than 3 standard deviations away from the mean IQ.)",0
"Any entrepreneurs here? Tired of dealing with a business world that doesn’t get it Basically what the title says. Thankfully I work on my own, but the amount of shit I have to deal with is incredible. 

In the past, I have seen very superficial colleagues (and sometimes idiots, I am sorry but that’s what it is) being chosen over me for management positions. Guess who they relied on after being promoted? That’s right, yours truly.

So I thought “fuck it” and went freelance. I have been working on my own for nearly a decade now. The exact same thing continues to happen, I am just getting handsomely paid for the annoyance.

But I struggle to find new clients, because I am expensive, and that’s because I offer quality. It’s difficult to make people understand that, and I often don’t have visibility as a contractor or I am asked to sign an NDA.

I am considering setting up a company and hiring others to do my job, and I have spoken with business consultants who said “are you sure that is a good choice” and “why don’t you just charge differently and continue working on your own”.

I live in a HCOL area and I don’t have the luxury of hesitating any longer. I’d rather not go into details on what I do.

Is any of you an entrepreneur, and how do you the f know when it’s time to just go for it? But also: how do you make business decisions in a world that doesn’t go at your speed?

ETA: Thank you all for your advice. Sorry, I wrote this right after a shitty meeting I had this morning when a prospective web agency I was hoping to hire to redo my website started dishing out unsolicited advice about the state of my sector and my job prospects. It was such a shitty meeting and it really knocked the wind out of my sails. I have included more details in the comments.",0
"Re daughter My daughter is 9 and was assessed as 'gifted' last year. We don't really talk about her as being special or anything but encourage her to work hard, and enjoy learning (as we do with our son, 7). I hear the stories here and don't connect them with her as she is otherwise a very regular kid, with friends, hobbies and so on. 

One thing I notice is that she has this energy for everything and really crams everything into a day - piano, reading, playing, sewing, writing in the morning and then after school activities - basketball, drama, singing, swimming, tennis and wants to do scounts, rock climbing, painting and so on... I want to say yes to everything but also work 4 days and run the house and so she thrives while I'm running her around and I feel she is never really satisfied and could always do more. Whatever we are doing she is up for it and more. I love this but it's really full on as well. I don't know if this is related to her IQ, and if so, and advice, or if it's just part of her? I'm sure it's not behaviour exclusive to high IQ.

Any other advice is welcome too. Both my kids are just gorgeous and I love to see them happy and love to hear what has worked/not worked for you.",0
"dyscalculia I've been treated like I'm dumb my entire life so I started to believe I'm dumb and not able to understand math due to having dyscalculia has helped contribute to this thought pattern. 

They've tried for a long time to calculate my IQ and it has always changed. They finally wrote down that they cannot accurately determine my IQ due to multiple disabilities especially cause dyscalculia and a processing disorder.

 I have gifted friends who have explained to me that I'm not stupid and I seem to understand some complicated stuff that the average person doesn't but they can't seem to convince me and I always feel like there just trying to make me feel better although that isn't the case. 

I see a common idea is that gifted or [higher than average inteligence but not gifted] means high IQ or great ability in mathematics. So I have to ask do people like me exist and can this be true that I could be smarter than average even with that disability? 

I hear twice exceptional exists but I never hear about dyscalculia and gifted people or above average inteligence. I've always felt lonely and I've been prone to talking over people's heads or getting disregarded in therapy due to appearing smarter than I am. It's a weird feeling, on one hand, on one hand I want to believe everyone but on the other hand, I don't.",0
"Am I silly for wanting ACT accommodations? I have diagnosed ADHD, which my giftedness has overshadowed for most of my life. I did wonderful in school up until 9th grade where the overwhelming emotions of being a teenager, experiencing imposter syndrome, and my horrible ability to detach myself from reality anytime something slightly overwhelmed me caused me to down spiral. I found refuge in online school until that became too much and I was (and still kind of am) months behind in school. Eventually, my brilliant mother pieced together that I had ADHD. Now that you have my life story I'll get to what this is all about. I know I could take the ACT and get a fine score. I took it once in 7th grade for some program and got an 18 (a score that I was frustrated with as I knew I could get higher.) And again in 9th grade and got a 24. I know that I could take it and get a score that a lot of people would accept as good and move on. But aren't I still being held back from my true potential by a learning ""disability"" (quotes because I don't know if that's the correct term to use?) I'm having trouble figuring out if it would be silly to ask about this. I know that I'm ""smart"" enough to level the playing field, but that doesn't change the fact that I have a very hard time maintaining internal focus. I am constantly thinking about a **multitude** of random things, this can come from a thought that just pops into my head or a specific word that jumpstarts a memory/previous thought that I had been dwelling on. I find myself reading sentences 8 or 9 times, before realizing I'm not even reading them at all, just going through the motion of ""reading"" whilst thinking about something, and not even *realizing* it. Someone, please give me an outside perspective on this because I'm too uncertain.

&#x200B;

Now that I'm re-reading this I didn't mention that I am medicated, but medication only goes so far, and I really only feel it helps with giving me satisfaction after completing a task (cleaning my room, doing the dishes ETC.) It does not, however, calm that neverending need for any sort of stimulation (internal or external) I can find.",0

"A window into me At age 8, I'd finished primary school work. My teacher continued to give me stuff that was way too easy, so I just didn't do it. It was too boring so I'd just go off in my own world. Teacher decided I had ADHD, so I got tested at the local University. Came back as being gifted. School didn't change anything, despite the Uni prompting extension programmes.

Because of the lack of challenges in my education when I was younger, I've reached this weird point in my life where if I can't do something, I freak out or just don't do it. 

I've always struggled socially, I'm too loud or too bossy or too much. I've learned to close in on myself, that way I can't get hurt.

I've always cruised through school, it's my happy place and I really love learning. I'm starting Uni this year. Totally scared, super excited. But I'm also stuck in this limbo. I feel unfulfilled with my world and have a month until the first semester starts. I don't know what to do with myself, my anxiety is constantly through the roof and I need something to fill my life with.

"in contact with developmental equals: Looking for good examples around the world Hi all,

&#x200B;

I'm looking into creating an organization where developmental equals can find each other and feel at ease. 

I'm currently looking for good examples around the world to determine what shape this organization could have.

It's like having a local club house where you feel at home, can be who you are and find likeminded people. This for toddlers, kids, adolescents and grown ups alike. 

It's not a place for coaching, treatment, schooling. It's more a place to relax, share interests and feel normal. Everyone there is gifted so you just fit right in.

Im grateful for the lovely connections I have but I know that I get them more than they get me and its just so hard to always be in that position. I have no one to talk truly talk to.

"An unborn path. Hello everyone,

I'm struggling to carve my own path in life due to my own lane being invaded by others'. I'm an eccentric, quirky, creative and artistic fellow who has a passion for philsophy mainly.

"Is not the liberation of our gifted soul the answer to many of our world's problem? Let's face it - 

  
We are witches. We understand slightly more - thus, see through contradiction and break through molds. We are what helps us (humanity) go forward. 

When our ideas differ too greatly to that of the established norms, we become the witches - hunted and torn. We pull back, crawl into our holes. 

  
In a world that refuses to seek the truth, the world that functions based on its hidden collective shadows - is not the liberation of our gifted soul the answer to many of our world's problem? In this regards - isnt our battle personal, but also social.

"Do you think this is appropriate on a cover letter? Hello, I am gifted and see myself as the rose with 1000 thorns. I am tired of each trying to pick me up, only to throw me and step on me each time a thorn appears. There is a delicate approach in understanding ourselves  - yet, I have grown tired of hiding myself - so fearful that if I show true self, someone will touch and get hurt by my thorns.   


Especially since it has led me to be burnt out, and miserable - trying to protect others, while those who claim to care for me and protect me are the very people who do not see me.  Everyone thinks they know me - everybody is certain that if they were me, they would do so much more - yet they do not understand the complexity, and pain of being gifted.   


I understsand - the idea of of masking/unmasking ourselves is quite controvertial with this subreddit - but, i hope for those who feel my desire to expose myself would invite further alienation would respect that I cannot see how much further I am going to get alienated given that I have lost so much trying to mask myself. In that regards, to those who feel me -

"My four year old got his first A+. I have mixed feelings. As a child, I was years ahead of my classmates in math.

I was taught that getting high marks was very important and I was rewarded for them. I remember being devastated when I didn’t get a high mark on a homework assignment.

My four year old son is also years ahead of his peers in math.

He attends a play based junior kindergarten and he has never been graded for anything.

He also attends the Russian School of Math two grade levels above his age (but that might change). 

We enrolled him because we want to encourage his talent and recognize that he might find school boring. His classmates at school are learning to recognize numbers and he’s playing with the Collatz conjecture (seriously).

Usually, RSM gives stickers when the kids do their lesson work.

This time, there was a large red A+ written across his lesson because he did the entire thing independently (he did it in less than 15 minutes and spent the rest of the time drawing constellations and silly faces)

My son didn’t know what it meant. He wrote A minus next to it because “minus is the opposite of plus”

I know on the surface this sounds ridiculous but should I ask them to give stickers because he’s too young to be chasing the A+. He’s so much younger than the other kids in his class.

So what do you all think? 

Bonus: if your kid attends or if you attended RSM, I’d love to hear your experience.",0
"Am I narcissistic? I am currently a junior in high school and when talking to my peers I usually have two thoughts. “Wow this person is dumb” and right after, “why would you even think that?? You can always learn something from somebody.” I try to live by that motto every day, but sometimes I try to talk to people my age, or even my elders, and I always get bored or irritated because they don’t understand concepts or they are so confident while saying something so wrong. Then, when I try to correct them, they get mad/defensive. I have heard countless times from many different age groups that “Oh my god you make me feel so stupid” but that really isn’t my intention. I just want people to be educated when they talk on certain subjects. It has now evolved into some of my friends saying they know a certain subject we are discussing and then I ask them about it and they admit that they really do not know. The reasoning that they give me is “well I feel dumb when I talk to you and I don’t know what you’re talking about”. But if they don’t know something I would rather they admit it and I give them a better/more in-depth explanation then act like they do know. Typically I get agitated when I find out they lied and not when they need a better explanation.


Edit: Ok I see a lot of “well people are allowed to be wrong” in the comments. So should we just stop fact checking people then?? It’s not the fact that people are wrong, it’s the unwillingness to be wrong when someone tells them they are

Also, i think some of you missed the part where I said corrections and not advice. I am not going around telling people that their morals are wrong or that god isn’t real. And I’m also not telling people what to do in a situation or invalidating their feelings. What I said I was doing is giving people the correct information when they are wrong about something that CAN BE PROVEN.

Edit #2: if all that you’re going to comment is that I’m a know it all and that I want to look smarter/argue with others, please don’t comment. I’m looking for actual advice so if you’re just here to tell me what I am then don’t comment. I know

Also, when correcting people, I am not turning it into a lecture. Its just them being wrong about something, me telling them what they were wrong about, and moving along in the conversation. Unless they ask me the reason, I usually don’t go off on a tangent about why.",0

"Some ramblings about my condition as ""F1shfuck3r2003"" Honestly Just a stream of thoughts to try and justify my condition. I am a Young Guy 19 years old, all my life i felt like there is a disconection between the me i experience and the one i show, a mask If you Will, i don't know for certain How that mask portrays It self in function not only for what i can shape of It, but Also the limitations of my thoughts in defining How i seem to the outside world. And If i were to continue this i think i should stabilish what i think of myself and what i objectively am. In what i believe is and ""dunning krugernization"" of the big give personality traits.

I am highly introverted( or lowly extroverted whatever fits your hat),being so i despise being the center of attention and mostly wish to talk only at one person (that fits a criterea) or a group of like minded people.

My neuroticism and overall emotional stability seem to little bit lower then average but often i see me in those profoundly non-social stressfull envioroments and in them my self steem persists as a burning rage of hate against existence itself , i simply am able to completly cope with any form that i know of existencial depression or overall existencial dread while being aware of It most of the time.

I am highly open to ideas and criticissm as well Very creative in my Fields of interest, that would pretty much even at a general level ALL of the sciences as well abstract and philosphical Fields, and expend the majority of my time aware of what i need to reflect or Just reflection and introspectivo almost every Second of each day. even tho the epistemology used to gather and hypothesise over the data might be questionable.

I believe i am selective when It comes to agreeableness as i feel pretty much nothing towards most people misery and often think of them as well as my self as functions in a system that can be reduced to It's most fundamental values and treated as nothing more, and yes i see the issues with that line of thought, and i do scold myself a Lot over what i think and what i should think of the people that surround me in a form of internal debate that resembles the atriction between what to Desire and what to restraint, that of wich some would call ""a moral conscience"".

And for last we have conscientiousness.
I am not Very conscientious but that would be more for lack of necessity than otherwise, with what others would be worried about like debt or overall living expenses, i am okay (for my life i have been a Very privileged but Still quite contempt and never very greedy about what i wish to be gifted more then what the social contracts require) and instead worry about things that aren't urgent, like what Will be the consequences of genetic engeneering If It is released an upgraded form of gene therapy on the Market or If there is a way to unify the universe into a being whose concsciousness would be able to subvert the Nature of what It is made of, and then what would be the results of the change of Power between the made and the material It limits It's expression. I got Carried out, Sorry.

But i Still would like to have a deeper understanding of myself as well How i am My greatest enemy and what to be cautios of when REMINDED i am an imperfect human being.
As well the roots of what i think could develop in some form of mysogyny and i fear that.
But being more clear, i suspect that my misantropy, wich It's bases is Very questionable and i could to some degree be considered a racist, even tho ALL of those are given rise to lack of experience and overall social anxiety. But as saying, i think my misantropy is not equal across the sexes, i think i fear both women and Men, but mostly because i expect the worse in them, or expect almost no concsciousness or self-critical thinking, aligned with their fact i need and Desire some degree of bonding and ""to be accepted"" as well seem most of those Men who seem uneducated and are from minorities,. Be It Black or latino. Or in the case of women a necessity for aproval for those i see as authorities. I don't know the exact reason why these fears, although i have some ideas, the fear of them is real and i am not proud of It.

Well If by now you Still don't think i am an asshole i would probably greatly hate you or be weirdly empathethic depending on the reason of such ""aproval"" and If you do think i am an asshole, i say to you that i would like to know why and How i could be an overall more agreeable person as well being more able to see the ""Gold from the mud"", to be more respectful and less entitled due to My ignorance and my hubris.

"What is the best type of therapy/psychological help for late discovered giftedness. Lately discovered via psychologist and IQ test that i’m gifted she could recommend only one psychologist specialised in giftedness but the location is to far away. also the psychologist was not familiar enough with the subject.

So what’s my problem: overstimulation and imbalances in energy levels due to thinking, adapted behaviour, under stimulation, extremely driven, restlessness, depression and isolation, overthinking in social environments and hawks eye/loop perspective, burnout/bore out multiple times, inability to create, procrastination, loneliness, being misunderstood, can’t find like minded friends even if i am an extraverted person and have friends. next to that i am the school dropout/challenger type of gifted.

Has anyone experienced the same? What would you recommend to me? 

I feel like I could be so much happier if I could find people who I could relate to but that seems an impossible task.",0
"Does anyone feel like people are narcissistic, tribalistic, or nitpicky these days? I remember this conversation where I was trying to explain my experiences and thoughts but this NPC thought it was a direct attack on his soul. I think people look down on me based on looks and status. They also don't understand that statements can be true in some context and not in other contexts (black and white thinking). I also experienced distrust based on nothing but looks and other superficial differences.

Has anyone here faced similar experiences? How are you doing and what do you think we as a society can do to fix this? Many people are already talking about this narcissism/tribalism/lower iq trend but their words are largely flushed into the toilet.

EDIT: on the NPC thing, I meant it as a half joke. I can't believe how so many people got triggered by that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. People don't understand I much I suffered for trying to speak truth.
On the other hand if you still think I am the bad guy or whatever how do you think people like me should be dealt with let's get this discussion going people.",0
"6.5 year old, I'd love some opinions. Hello all,

My 6.5 year old son has always been an advanced reader, and loves doing math problems in his head. After some interesting conversations with his teacher it was clear that the teacher wasn't going to allow him to read more challenging books than the class, or provide any extra math problems to keep my son interested.

We decided to go out of pocket to have him assessed, as the school board won't be assessing him until he is around 10 years old.

The psychologist reported back a fsiq in the 92nd percentile, a GAI in the 98th percentile. Of note was her verbal comprehension where he was in the 99th percentile. They are recommending an IEP for giftedness.

We don't want him moved from his class, we mostly just want something we can point to while we say, ""No, he won't be reading the picture books at home.""

Are there any downsides to getting the IEP in place? I guess I'm looking for the perspective of anyone who had an IEP like this.",0
"Hypothesis on Lifetime Success - Lifetime Success is Largely Determined by the Ability to Overcome Deeply Ingrained Cognitive Biases in Behavior. I have spent a disproportionate amount of time in my life thinking about why people are the way they are, the problems they have, and the root causes of those problems. I suspect that the issue is the brain's natural approach to life includes a series of cognitive biases that helped evolutionarily but no longer do. They seem to stem from the brain's desire to conform information it's ""seeing"" to its already existing model.

One prominent example is the tendency for group conformity demonstrated in Asch's conformity experiments. While many of us may be in the 25% of people who always chose the correct line, I don't believe we're perfectly non-conforming in more socially important situations, but I believe the ability to be non-conforming in certain situations is what sets people apart in major ways.",0
"Disclaimer - I am not gifted, have any of you experienced bullying from gifted kids? I got mocked through out Middle school/Music school, changing schools 5 times - staying 5th at time when lockdown started Sorry if I cause you pain by reading my comment,I am not aware of my english mistakes - Grammar, spelling, punctuation. I've been bullied all my life , never had friends when I was little due to lower IQ, lower inteligence, I was treated the same way as Charly Gordon by bakers from ""flower for algernon"" I couldnt understand why people laughed at me, stole my personal items, made me do foolish things in public to make me a mockery, I was their jester and their taste of humor involved me being picked on. There were few gifted student, gifted girls who often got seperated from regular classes attending gifted program or more accelerated program - this is due to being forced getting tested early age 8 Woodcock Johnsons IQ test - or atleast evaluated further suspecting giftedness. At 1-4th grade I was pushed away from groups/my class, I didnt talk alot, I had nothing to say particularly, I dont remember my childhood that much - just the abandonment and teachers calling me stupid dull acting surprised if I could perform atleast average or if I can recall anything from previous classes. Teachers were open to speak infront of all class if student wasnt performing good - if they made a mistake/couldnt understand material, so I was a mockery to teacher probbly that nfluenced students to bully me and see me as a low mediocre pathetic human, I remember being called cringe when I rarerly spoke, I could hear those girls they whispered to one another idk how they thought I couldnt hear or if anyone couldnt hear - it wasnt in my native language they did say (cringe) in english might have thought I'm incapable of learning another language which took me more than 5 years. I was ostracized alot because of them, + when I asked my teacher not to get bullied by my classmates, teacher decided it's best to talk with all of the clas instead of (who, i mentioned) make my every day shittier than it allready was cuz now they started calling me many different words relating to (Me asking teacher for help) making a mockery of that action I took. I moved out from that school I got into 10th grade, 3 months into new school I moved cuz I tried to kil myslef I was hospitalized. 3rd school they sorted children by difficulty level, I got sent to highest difficulty for english classes despite as I appear very poor beginner level of english, I got selected cuz my grade was 8/10,I got bullied by teacher, she asked(Why are you here instead of lower difficulty) - I'm guessing she has never felt insecure cuz the whole class was involved hearing her words directing towords me + my social anxiety made it worse so I was sent to lower class difficulty instead middle cuz my teacher never heard me speak english.

"Threatened by other people's intelligence. I'm sure I'm not the only one dealing with this kind of thing. I'm 22, was categorized as gifted as a kid, and generally for most of my life I was considered by most people to be smart. Very smart even. While I don't feel very smart myself, that perception that people have of me has solidified as a key to my self esteem. In a sense, I'm only good insofar as I am polite and smart.

Now, intellectually I understand that this is silly. Your worth isn't determined by how smart you are, and the fact that someone is smarter than you (whatever that even means) doesn't make your own intelligence meaningless. My friends will not suddenly stop valuing me because someone smarter happens to exists nearby.

And yet I can't help but feel like the mere presence of other highly intelligent people is a threat. That I should always do my best to prove myself superior. I don't want to make a fool of myself and miss out on friendships because of my own insecurities.

How do I stop feeling like that?",0
"How common is it for you guys to feel like therapy isn't going anywhere? I've had two ""long term"" therapists and with both I felt like all I was walking out of those sessions with was just generic advice.

Perhaps they were just incompetent and improvised instead of giving professional advice, who knows.

I sometimes think (and this probably sounds hella narcissistic but it's not meant to) that I need someone much smarter and wiser than myself for therapy to work. I need something novel in terms of solutions and I need help with things that are outside of my control (such as executive dysfunction from ADHD but that's a whole 'nother story).

"How to be content? 26 (M). 
I have been certified gifted from a young age, iq 135 at 9 years old but never told, then 145 at 26.

Growing up I had always been puzzled by how silly, illogical, and dumb my peers were. They didn't understand the long teem effects of decisions, they didn't digest information as quickly, and thier social dynamics were easy to predict and influence. Additionally, my overbearing parents didn't allow me to socialise much outside of school, which made me feel more isolated and lonely. I had a few good friends but the only commonalities we shared were memes and video games. They didn't share my fascination with the world, my physical activity level, and most of all mu understanding of society. I was seen ad smart, wise, and confident, with many kids coming to me for help ans support. But there was no one I could turn to. My parents were cold and distant. And with that I decided to do my best and that when I've grown up my freedom as an adult will help me bulid my prefect world. 

I moved abroad for uni, started businesses, made friends from all over the planet, but never felt fulfilled. All the people I meet are predictable, too emotionally influenced, and almost none understood my fascination with everything. This led me to years of depression, feeling deeply isolated and sad. No one noticed ofc nor did i want them to. I thought that maybe I should try dating, something I was putting off until I had at least found my tribe, but since that failed why not I thought. As a tall man with many desirable qualities, I had no issues meeting interested women, but the criteria for a romantic interest turned out to be much higher and harder to meet than that of a friend. 

I went to psychologist to talk about my loneliness with. He noticed that I might be gifted, had me tested, and voila a 145. After i asked my parents if they knew, my mum told me about the other test and that they didn't  think much of it. I was confirmed to be different. An Alien. Something I always knew but never wanted to admit. He said that I am unique and deep relationships will always be hard to create for me. I lowered  my expectations of others to help close the gap but it's hard.

My food tastes more bland with every passing month, hobbies keep getting dull, people are books following a cliche storyline. Why do I stay? Why do I continue to exist? I've travelled extensively, I tried so much but felt so little. Why can't I be dumb and happy? Why can't i be reckless? Why can't I make mistakes and be OK with it? Even if I force myself, it'll all be fake. I don't have the pleasure of naivety. I try to find pleasure in the little things but I need more. How can I be content? 

Ps: I treat myself well, excercise, cook/eat good food, try new activities constantly and try and meet interesting people. But I'm getting sick of it all. I wish to be erased from existence so that I can finally feel at peace. No suicidal thoughts, just hopping thanos snaps me away aka natural causes.",0

"Anyone else feels higher levels of giftedness is seen as insanity? See, I experienced war trauma as a child. And thus, I was orphaned by the world at a young age. Parents absent, communities that did not know how to love. Teachers a bit overwhelmed. 

To cope with a world that never understood me - i simply disassociated and built an inner world. I had no cable growing up, so i read books to run away from it all. I found solace in Matilda - i was certain I too had a gift. Because why else would life to be so unfair. 

Since then, I simply showed people what i thought was the ideal of being a human. Someone kind, someone who believed in the ideals and values of not just my parents culture, or my new nation but that of the world. I learned from Disney and I tried to be a prince in the best way I could. This is how the mind of a gifted child with no home, in constant trauma found hope - that one day, it will get better. 

So, as I grew older, everyone saw me through their lived experience and the little i showed to them. Even with my closest friends - they failed to see me.

I did not know i was gifted - because my schools identified me as a slow learner. Yet, i did end up in University, which was a break thru for my family. The first - and I did enter the work force and i excelled - i was a rising star but i still thought me a bit insane simply because they did not understand my inner world and complexities.

Like I had people who came from wealthy families who accused me of having a wealthy father and connection. Others saw me defending the poor as a facade and brand. Its almost like they all saw me as a sociopath.

She’s in the first grade now, she’s ahead by a year or two we think. Claims she’s “bored, because I know all the lessons”.

Her teacher is on her third act of her career. Public school (USA) is decent, but lacks STEM and enrichment activities after school.

"There isn't a way out, is there? Today I went to the psychotherapist to tackle various problems.  But somehow I had the feeling that I couldn't be helped and that this will never change.  I have the feeling that there is no way out of this ""madness"".  I have the feeling that therapists somehow don't understand me with all these dubious connections that my brain forms.

I mean that I often do things ""on the side"" that other people would never think of.  I'm often said to have a ""different"" way of thinking, people think I'm crazy.  And if that's what I'm told, then sometimes I wonder what ""madness"" I'm actually living in.  For example, some time ago I wrote and illustrated and published a book.  And that's not a huge achievement in principle, but I do something like that on the side.  I sometimes have the feeling that my whole life is so ""on the side"".

"Verbal high IQ My 7 year old just went through evals (to look into an ADHD diagnosis). He has always been pretty curious and verbal. He tested 99 percentile in verbal skills (WISC-V) and listening comprehension (WIAT-4).

The psych emailed his teacher and said his chatting was boredom, and he needed increased challenge. I can promise you that his teacher rolled his eyes all the way into the back of her head.

I guess I just don’t know what to do with the information? If anything. He has an impossible bar for himself in everything he does. What if his teacher doesn’t agree that he needs more challenge?

"Heya! Hi!

I was in the gifted program in school. I just don't know where else to put this.

I'm not the smartest person. Most of the time, I'm the stupidest in the room, but I'm very good at intellectualizing and putting my feelings into words that resonate with people when I really try.

I used to be really proud of this, but I'm realizing that perhaps I intellectualize too much. Like, I put my descriptions of my feelings on my sleeve, but I never hand people \_me\_. When stressful events happen, I logically handle it and logically 'experience' it before I actually let my brain process the emotion, if that makes sense? I'm learning to sit with uncomfortable emotions, let people in my heart rather than my head, and how to remember that my mother loves me when I'm sad.

I just wanted to see if anybody was willing to try with me. I'm looking for friends that I 'click' with, and it's really hard. A lot of my friends think with their heart before their head, so I feel like I hurt them a lot with how emotionally unavailable I am, and I don't want to subject them to that. I also don't want them to know just how much I actually mask around them, because they might see that I'm an entirely different person when I'm alone and realize that we don't actually click.

I want a friend who's down to be told 'this conversation is boring to me' and 'I don't like this particular thing about you but I like you just enough still'. I want a friend who's kind of a jerk, I guess. Are you a jerk? Maybe we'll get along.

"struggling with master thesis Hello, I am glad I found this community.
Tbh, I am not sure if I am gifted (no diagnosis and I just recently started researching this topic more), but I do think I have similar problems.
- perfectionism
- overthinking and thinking too complex
- I also get carried away fast with side topics that come up during research but are not that important for my thesis
- paradox: only got A's in my master courses, but taking super long time to finish thesis / not good with deadlines

My problem is, that I am wanting to finish my thesis but I am also very slow! I got all the information in my head, I know everything that I need to write but it is hard for me to write it down in the complex way in which it exists in my head. And if I write ""mediocre"" sentences I feel like I am writing nonsense/sth. that does not do justice to the topic. At the same time I just want to finish and probably never write an academic thesis again.

"Question for autistic members of this sub I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was 12 but I don't use the ""Asperger's"" label. I also found out I was highly gifted recently. There has also been a disconnect between my presentation and clinical expectations, which is fairly common, but also a disconnect between my experiences and that of other autistic people. 

I want to address the disconnect with clinical expectations, because after my diagnosis, these expectations played a role in the way I was treated by people in my life. Basically, it was assumed that I was incompetent in areas where I had always shown competence before. There's also a disconnect between much of the information I've read about autistic interests in some research materials and what I experience. For example, I've read that it's fairly common for autistic people to gather information and facts about particular subjects of interest, often without fully understanding what these facts mean. I have found that these descriptions tend to take on a tone of pathologization, implying disorder and disfunction. All my interests since I was a child, no matter how small, has been described as a special interest when my interest in that subject may either be passing or merely one of my multiple interests I like to pursue. I have no interest in learning about something without understanding and applying it to some sort of personal or creative endeavor, either. 

&#x200B;

Other traits that are associated with autism that present atypically for me include language, communication, repetition and routine. I have never struggled with understanding abstract concepts. I would, from a young age, consistently think more abstractly than my peers. For example, I could be sitting in class and the teacher would ask us to interpret a piece of art or literature. I would have a few interpretations in mind but I wouldn't say anything because I assumed everybody else had at least one of those interpretations or something more insightful. I would wait for 10 seconds or so for somebody to offer up their interpretation. Half the time, I would be the only one with any interpretation, and other times, one or two students would have an interpretation that was rather concrete. I would be the only one making interpretations that were abstract and tied into other topics of discussion. 

&#x200B;

In communication, it was assumed that I didn't understand metaphorical language, humor or small talk when I was either bored by conversations or understood the jokes being told and simply didn't find them funny. Sometimes, a metaphor or idiom would spark a thought or an idea and I would try to discuss that. That would be interpreted by my peers as not understanding that they were joking or making an analogy. This is an area where, upon examination, I showed the exact opposite of what many would expect from an autistic kid.

I also never struggled with many allistic social norms that many autistic people mention struggling with. Many autistic people mention that they struggle to understand when 'lying' is expected of them, for instance. Sometimes, I'll find communication guides created by autistic people full of observations and translations of allistic social communication and I'll realize that the way I communicate aligns more closely with allistic people, at least in the way I intuitively understand and interpret social interaction. Combined with how I tend to express emotion and even feign interest out of politeness, many people, including some autistic people and most psychologists, find it hard to believe that I'm autistic. I never made an explicit effort to mimic body language or social interaction. Most of the ways in which I struggle involve a disconnect in my interests and passions. While I've never fit in, I could understand most people which helped me to develop a sense of humor that a lot of my peers could appreciate. I was the class clown in high school.

&#x200B;

I also hate routine and sameness. I get bored of foods, activities, music, etc. rather quickly. I've never been able to listen to songs on repeat and I've never had ""safety foods"" that I would eat on a daily basis. I crave new experiences.

&#x200B;

None of this is to say that I'm likely not autistic. I am. I didn't talk until around the time I started reading around age 2. I've merely highlighted the contrasts I've noticed.  I just wanted to share my experiences in the hopes that other gifted autistic people could resonate, share their own experiences or insight. I also apologize if any of this is unclear or worded strangely. I'm running on three hours of sleep in 36 hours.",0
"What does a healthy student/professor relationship look like? Hey everyone. Lately I’ve (24F in my last year of uni) been struggling with what constitutes as a healthy student/professor relationship. I’m posting this here bc idk where else to post this and I trust this sub! Ultimately it could be a gifted problem and I figure a lot of you know how to navigate university. 

Questions:
- What do healthy student professor relationships look like?
- Do students and professors ever become friends or is that inappropriate?
- What are ways I can reach out to my professors? I get extremely nervous that I’m bothering them 

Here’s my background as to why I ask. You don’t have to read to answer but if anyone has advice tailored to my situation I would be forever grateful<3

CW: Sexual assault

Basically I just don’t know what a healthy student/teacherORprofessor relationship looks like. 
Basically I was raised in a weird household, not healthy. I went to high school at a speciality school in which I grew extremely close with the teachers of my major. They treated the kids they liked more as adults than children and since it was our major we spent a lot of time together. There were two men in particular I was closest with. One of them got arrested the year after I graduated for having sex with one of my friends in my class. After arresting/sexual assault incident THE ENTIRE department quit, like 5 other teachers, all of whom I was close with. The other man I was particularly close with also quit and kinda fell into a depression hole and doesn’t work rn even, I just couldn’t believe it because I had so much respect for him and he has such a strong work/ivy league background. To note, I was extremely passionate about my major and the connections I made there and what I was building, and for it to literally all crumble the moment I left was so shocking. I just felt hopeless especially seeing my mentors fall, it’s so hard to be strong in this world and when the people you look up to can’t even handle it? The people you thought were strongest. It’s like since there was so much lying and hiding it made it all feel fake, what I had built and made me question the fuck out of my passion. 
Anyway, now I’m literally terrified of teachers or getting close to them in any capacity. I’ve met wonderful professors since and just cannot help but run away at small talk or any attempts of bonding. But the sad thing is that I want that bond more than anything. I plan to work in academia and have always related to teachers more than peers. I feel like it’s common to persue your career through professors or connections they’re able to get you. There are so many smart teachers I have that I want to pick at their brain. But for some reason, when I try it feels literally inappropriate and wrong, like I shouldn’t be attempting a friendship with them. I worry that I’m trying to fill a parental void my parents can’t give me and seek validation from my superiors. Obviously I can see the unhealthy boundaries, sexual relations or just a toxic relationship that could happen between any two people. But it’s like…are we allowed to be friends and chat?

Are there any life paths where both my ADHD strengths and my giftedness can work together?   


My therapist just diagnosed me with giftedness and ADHD. I came forward to him about having chronic pain and not being able to manage life and university at the moment. He took the time to reevaluate my diagnosis of depression and came to this diagnosis.   


Which means my whole life is build in the way where the giftedness helped me mask the ADHD and cope with it. But the pressure of it all leads to debilitating headaches. (Leaving out the details, but you get the gist).   
I need to work on things, be stimulated and engaged in fun projects!   
But I am seriously reconsidering the academic path I am on at the moment (in social studies). Even though I am good at it, the self-organization and self-motivation draiiiiins me and I am not able to show up with my strengths at most times! The lifestyle doesn't fit and I can't hold it up.  
I whish there was a research boarding school for adults.   
Are there any life paths where both my ADHD strengths and my giftedness can work together?   
I would like to not struggle against myself and stay ""below my potential"".   


Help! How are your career paths treating you? What works well in your life because of your giftedness? What do you struggle with? What elements would you not choose again for yourself (maybe college?)? What is it worth it to ""bite through""?   


I would be so happy to hear about your experiences. Thank you very much!!

"How to know if your child is gifted? Some of son's pals were asked to appear in CogAT test. I think my child may be gifted, but I was wondering how to know for sure. While there is no definitive way to determine if a child is gifted, there are a few signs that can help you identify if your child is gifted. He is able concentrate on tasks for extended periods of time and also have an unusually large vocabulary for his age. What are the other traits that I should be looking for?",0
Gifted or testingmom - Which is better for my son in grade 2? My son has been shortlisted for CogAT on the basis of his science project. His fellow classmates have been practising on one app called Gifted Test Prep for the CogAT which offers picture-based practice questions. I am also thinking to take the subscription so that my son can practice there in his free time. I have also heard about testing mom. Not sure which one is better.,0
"Needing the right environment to thrive to an extreme degree and need ideas / thoughts I’m sharing the following things about me only to explain my efforts in how I’ve been coping in life, outwardly successful, ambitious and doing relatively well compared to peers.

Like most of you I have similar sentiments and experiences in loneliness, nonstop existential questions, childhood trauma like being accused by my teacher of copying homework because they didn’t believe I wrote my own essays, misdiagnosed with depression and adhd, multiple overexcitabilities to the point my life and work can only revolve around it, told I’m gifted unsolicited by six different therapists, finally took IQ tests which is not an issue for me as much as other “giftedness aspects” as stated above are.

I don’t know if this is a consequence of it, but I also struggle with low self esteem and am highly sensitive to sound, light, smells, small disgusting things that look out of place but no one notices, other people’s reactions and feelings. All of these things are OVERWHELMING. At work, I’m highly disagreeable not on purpose but because I come to different conclusions as others, and I’m in an environment where people are considered accomplished and smart. I started writing this post because I just had a miscommunication with a tour guide who told me my expectations for the tour are too high, when I expressed my expectations at the start we’re to complete X Y Z locations and they cannot get that this is my goal that I wanted to complete, when completing X is enough.

Over the years I’ve realised the need to put myself in environments and around the right people so I can cope, function and actually thrive. These come in little bits and pieces, and I’m still learning. For example, I cut out all my friends who found me “weird” and didn’t understand what I found so exciting about my interests. I was always sharing insights with walls. After cutting them out, I felt less sad and hurt about myself. I don’t know if anyone has experienced this before, but I can’t be in environments where I’m thought of as boring ever again. I also changed my workplace to one that is more equal for women so I can speak out about my ideas, and where healthy disagreement is rewarded. It’s hard to find social company that can keep up with me, but I found it a niche interest group tied to my overexcitabilities. There are some issues because I’m a woman and most of my interests only have men in the communities, so there’s a lot of loneliness there but it’s better than being around people I have to pretend with. Finally, with sensory issues, I stated exercising, meditating but I notice that for me to have a good vacation for example, I need to plan to the finest detail, check with the hotels on the cleanliness in advance and only go for 5 star hotels, review the service to not be disappointed. All of this sounds extremely intense but it’s just so on holiday when I need everything to be perfect fo relax, even the smallest things like a waiter being rude or a dirty spot in the hotel room can affect my mood and disgust meter.

Basically, I found out that the way I cope is extremely exhausting. I find myself quite broken actually, super neurotic, my communication with other people is way off but I don’t know how to change it or cope. I get upset on a daily basis because even though i try my best to consider other people’s ideas, I can see the most pragmatic and lowest resource route right away and people only realise this much later. I don’t mean to sound elitist but most people are really stupid in the sense that they waste more resources and time to do something because that’s the only perspective they can see, and they can’t be too open to other perspectives because of unspoken social rules.

I wrote on this sub because I wonder if anyone else is also designing “perfect”environments for themselves and has tips and ideas on how to best cope. My conclusion is that I have to be extremely rich so I can do things the way I want and think is objectively the best, catering to every tiny detail so I no longer feel disgust from sensory issues",0
"Best age to start music? Hi Gifted Community,

I have a 5 years old child who was assessed as gifted (he is very much of a numbers guy. He loves puzzles, non fiction books etc.) I have been told by many that it would be good for gifted kids to learn musical instruments.

I played the piano for many years when I was younger and now I appreciate it as an outlet for self expression. I’d like him to have that too. 

Would love to hear your stories about your learning journey with music or your children’s stories ie. Is it easy for gifted individuals to learn musical interment? If you play, is it a big part of your life? Do you feel like it’s an outlet that balances out your life? 

Thanks!",0
"What is a good way to put ur gifted on ur resume? I find the gifted identity to best contextualize my lived experience, additionally because giftedness is not well understood in organization and i live in a country where there is a greater flexibility to ideas and thoughts, I thought it best I talk about giftedness and neurodivergent - highlight strength and weaknesses, etc. for context, I am applying for a job where I can help develop training and educational materials to help integrate individuals into the labor market. 

How would you go about explaining it? i thought of linking a website with some criteria and then simply outline how this is related to my ability to do work.",0
"Can a gifted kid not take IQ tests seriously? I can't remember taking an IQ test when I was in elementary school. If I did, I might not have taken it seriously as I thought that being in class and doing well in assignments was enough.

I was recommended for the gifted program in 10th grade, and I didn't get in for whatever reason. I don't remember my scores. I might not have taken it seriously either. I don't remember the feeling.  I was probably being too slow on it. It might have been a bad recommendation letter or something. Then I do online IQ tests as an adult and get way above the gifted mark. Usually 150s-170s. I always hear about kids succeeding on IQ tests and getting into the gifted program. How do they find the motivation to do well on the IQ tests?",0
"How is it possible for me to understand something without being able to explain it My non-verbal IQ is probably 142 but my verbal IQ is 115. How is this cognitive profile possible?

This is just amazing. It's hard to find academic publications about giftedness in the context of adulthood. Academic publication focusses on child education and development, not much about how it's like to be as an Adult, even less so when you weren't diagnosed before well into adulthood and been wondering what's wrong about you. Not to mention when you have a learning disability

The author wrote this thesis after many years of clinical practice (more than 20y, uncertain)

In chapter 4, the author made a survey of litterature for what's available and gives an enjoyable thorough review. Even raising concerns that seemed to be mised from existing publications.

# Highlights

## Preamble

> “Despite decades of study with gifted children, the topic of gifted adults remains underexamined. This thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of the study of gifted adults by shedding new light on what is currently driving researchers’ interests in the topic and what various stakeholders think needs to happen to build knowledge in the field.”

(p. 2)




> “Experts in gifted research agree that there is an urgent need to evolve the field of gifted adults (Dai et al., 2011; Rinn & Bishop, 2015; Ziegler, 2009), and currently, it appears that interest in adult giftedness is growing amongst researchers, clinicians, and gifted adults themselves. However, there is little information about why this topic is attracting attention, the scope of different stakeholders’ interests and the extent to which they align, or how we can build knowledge to address key areas of concern to various interest groups.”

(p. 14)



> “This research and the thesis seek to provide some answers to two related questions: 
> 1. What is currently driving interest in the topic of gifted adults? 
> 2. What is needed to continue to move forward and build knowledge in ways that are meaningful to the various communities of interest?”

(p. 15)




> “My interest in the topic of gifted adults emerged slowly in response to questions in the work with certain psychotherapy clients. Over the years, I noticed that many of the adults I worked with shared a cluster of characteristics, subjective experiences, and narratives but, in contrast, had little in common in terms of age, identified gender, cultural backgrounds, occupations, and family situations.  Some of these clients had received medical diagnoses including depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder (...) and other personality disorders, but none appeared to show persistent signs or symptoms of such disorders. 
> Rather, each told stories about themselves that included intermittent ‘ups and downs’ that worried those around them (more than themselves), a sense of not fitting in, frequent boredom combined with delight in a range of experiences, interests and activities, and experiences of deep immersion in complex topics or issues. I eventually learned to ask about their learning experiences, and uncovered common experiences of finding school work easy as a child, misbehaving or being an exemplar in the classroom (and sometimes both), and thinking well beyond, and often at odds with, the requirements in school and, later, in work contexts.  
> It did not occur to me, my clients, or their referring physicians to consider that they might be gifted, because we all understood the concept to be contextually linked to education and academic achievement in school. 
> Nothing in our training or personal lives led us even to consider the concept. For example, my son was identified as being gifted in primary school, and our family experiences were exclusively around identification procedures based on psychometric tests and teacher nomination, or programming decisions and pedagogy, all within the school context. In other words, gifted education. The term gifted was not mentioned or considered relevant outside of the education system or beyond childhood.”

(p. 18)




> “**Generally, my clients’ questions about giftedness and their explorations are driven by personal interest**. Together, we are curious about what it might mean for them to understand themselves as being gifted, and what the implications might be for careers and relationships. While the word gifted does not initially sit well with my clients, what they read and learn about usually validates, to some extent, subjective experiences that have previously been un-named, misperceived, and/or hidden. **For example, many speak about having deep and passionate interests, and enjoying solving complex problems that others may not find interesting. For most, their attention to detail, absorption in ideas and projects, and (often) resulting fatigue has been viewed by others as dysfunctional and therefore pathologized**.”

(p. 19)


> “Nonetheless, the adults with whom I work tell me that they also find aspects of the published literature about gifted adults disturbing. In particular, they report that the focus on IQ and achievement in both gifted education literature and much of what they read about gifted adults in academic journals is jarringly at odds with their experiences. This is not to say that intelligence and achievement are not important aspects of my clients’ experiences and lives.  Rather, they tell me that the concepts are over-emphasized in the literature and misrepresent their personal values.
> (...)
> Additionally, those who have not chosen to pursue high-status careers report that reading gifted-related research about underachievement confirms deeply held beliefs about failing to live up to some (assumed) potential.
> (...)
> The contrast between my clients’ positive responses to some of what is written about gifted adults and their negative responses to others sparked my interest in what is currently known about gifted adults and, related to that, how ideas are presented in the literature.”

(p. 20)


> “[Despite decades of research about gifted children, the topic of] gifted adults appears to remain underexamined. (...) given the apparent discrepancy between my clients’ subjective experiences and some of the published literature about giftedness and gifted adults, where there are agreements and disagreements in the field.
> ”

"Do you ever feel like people are insane? Like, there is no reason at all to live the way we are living. At all. No reason why the ""week"" should be 40 hours. No reason why ""normality"" is the way it is - in fact, ""normality"" is completely insane, destructive and counterproductive.

Everybody is suppressing part of themselves because they're taught they need to suppress their feelings for absolutely no reason but to conform to nonsense arbitrary rules in order to make it in society. So everyone suppresses their body, needs, autonomy, spontaneity, emotions, etc  to fit into preconceived boxes that are completely arbitrary in the first place.

Everyone passively accepting nonsense hierarchies where basically everyone except a fully abled, white, hyperproductive, confident, heterosexual, etc. man is seen as a subhuman. It's like we collect identities and make a sum at the end to see how human we are. Then you get bursts of social movements when people for a fleeting moment realize they can voice the injustice. Headlines for a week, a month. Then everybody forgets.

People working like slaves in their tiny suffocating individualistic life, not questioning anything, not standing up, ""because that's how things are"", doing perfectly useless if not harmful and destructive jobs to enrich a handful of people who are in turn caught up in superiority complexes and a need for power to mask their own terror of death and powerlessness. Induced scarcity in turn induces competition. No one questions the idea of scarcity in the first place. Humanity enslaved to an idea of its own invention - money.

Then people buying useless and environmentally insane stuff. Then choosing a ""minimalistic lifestyle"" when they find themselves buried under piles of plastic products of distraction. Spending the money they earn in toxic distractions to forget about everything for two days.

Everyone knows that people are dying and there's so much suffering because of the greed of a few rich sectors of the global population. Yet no one really acts to change it or even talks about it at all. Problems are left unfixed. People shrug and they go about their daily habits.

Everyone obsessed by normality and prove they are _______ enough. People struggling to survive yet still finding the energy to fight each other constantly instead of getting together in a normal way to think about solutions.

This is the perspective of someone who lives in the west. But I think many things are generalizable (is that a word).

I can go on and on but it's all summed up in ""people are insane"". I serously do not feel part of humanity.",0
"The shape of a better world As for what a better ""shape"" of the world actually means, i Will be more speciffic.

saying shape is obviously a metaphor, for It does not have one, It is only a function to Itself, a tool where It uses to express something of It's Nature as well what made It's now state possible, the shape is nothing but the sum of the behaviors that are noticible in ANY kind of self growing/complexing system. that is, independent of form or way, It exists alongside the function that inhabits.
As for a better way to put It, society is a function that exists as a byproduct of those lines that mold and select autopoeisic behavior, as well protect and create, essentianly culture and sub-cultural divisional that exists alongside the Nature of humans as a while and It's derivations from the medium where It's creation was necessary.( Sorry for the overly abstract talk)

But one of the questions i am here to ask is, If what i Said is actually what It happens, then is there a way to better understand the most fundamental aspect of the behaviors behind the creation of self preserving paradimes? And If yes, there is some way to translate such ways that the systems use to develop alongside the necessities of It's subjects to minimize suffering and proliferate progress?

It obviously has many similarities to the theory of evolution, and i suppose It tales after the dinâmica between Power and oportunity, that is one is subjective (Power to act upon oportunity) and so inherent to the existence of the subject and the other is objective, that is simply what It is as an envioroment to the subject and the thus outside It's control, except It's predictability that It uses to maximize effectiveness.
It as can be seen an envioroment Can Also be an subject, an individual, formed to act Just as the ones who see It as an oportunity(micro-organisms/macro-organims, similar to a stair that It's perspective of up or down defines It's dinamic).
That of course has limits, not that it is sure what are they, Will there ever be ultra-organisms? Or even planetary ones? The size of plannets and so may live of the energy of the star It exists alongside as an parasite and almost living dyson sphere?

Many thoughts of course, exciting ones and terryfing ones, perhaps both, wich should be even more exciting even tho we haven't even scractched the Surface of what could be beneath.",0
"I don't know how to be proud of myself Disclaimers: english is not my first language and I'm on mobile.

I was diagnosed with ASD last year but I never seeked a diagnosis for giftedness (I don't think it matters in this case, I just feel like you guys can understand what I'm feeling). 

I went back to school last fall after a couple of years working in my first career. I'm in law school and I have a nearly perfect GPA for my first semester. I want to be proud of what I did but nobody around me can relate. 

When I'm with friends from school I have to downplay what I achieved so I don't hurt their feelings; they make comments about how they will never be like me and I'll just get all the awards or get into every programs/jobs I want when I graduate. 

When I'm with my friends and family it's like they don't understand how big this is for me. I mean, it's never been tough in school but I was never passionate about my subject like I am now. I feel like they believe it's normal for me to do something like this, like I could go to space and they'd go ""uh good job, anyway what are you doing next weekend?"" (You know the ""yes very sad"" meme from loki? Instead of ""very sad"", put ""very nice""). 

I know everyone seeks approbation but am I asking for too much? I don't want a ceremony, or a gift or a party, I just want someone to acknowledge what I did (and I'm aware it's not THAT great, but it's the best I've done in my entire life). I feel like a narcissist just writing about this.

I am proud of myself, but I feel like I canno't show it and like grades are taboo in a highly competitive environment (and with people in general apparenty). Can anybody relate? How do you deal with others envying you and your family not really caring about your accomplishments because they just got used to it?",0
"Waldorf school for a gifted child? Hi, so I wrote recently about my 3 y/o being assessed as gifted.

It was recommended that we look into special schooling for her. There's a Waldorf school in my area and I was wondering if this might be appropriate for a gifted child?

I just recently started looking into it and idk what to think. It's much nicer than the public school but not like anything that I've seen. I'm worried that it'll be boring. But regular school is so boring too.

My 3 y/o has never been to preschool or daycare or anything because I don't know what to pick. She chills with family all day, reads books, plays with toys, watches tv, plays in the yard. Seems to be fine with that, so idk what else to do.",0
"Gifted child with disruptive behaviour (We live in South America and do not have access to specific resources in other countries)

Our 4 year old son has no diagnosis and has only been deemed gifted with a social delay due to covid isolation, by his therapist. 

(Edit: to clarify, he has been assessed gifted already, but no other diagnoses)

At home we don't have many problems. He's a bit impulsive and messy. But also helpful and sweet. He usually sits quietly looking through his books or plays complex imaginary games with us.

In preschool however, he's pretty much a special needs kid. He requires a special ed teacher to go with him a lot of the time. He doesn't respect authorities, is anxious and disruptive. Even violent sometimes. We have to pick him up 15 minutes before the other kids because he's too much. It became very clear just how different he is at the end of the year ceremony. All the other kids were sitting quietly with their parents while our kid was running all over the place and had to be taken out several times because he was disturbing the ceremony.

He can name every bone and organ of the human body, tell you how a space rocket works and classify every type of marine animal. But he won't sit down at circle time or do simple crafts. He even got kicked out from his first preschool because he would break things, hit and even bite other kids. (There were some signs that he may have been abused there. He told us he was scared because the teacher did something, and would cry in horror in the mornings before going there the in the end.)

I've read that giftedness can be mistaken for adhd because they share some traits. But more recent studies seem to imply it's also common to have giftedness in combination with adhd or autism. Although it seems so much has changed in how all neurodivergent conditions are viewed in just the last couple of years that it's hard to catch up and actually understand any of it as an outsider. And especially giftedness is described as either nothing more than a high IQ, or a complex neurodivergence. 

Also, he's already been evaluated. And covid isolation was extreme here. Kids werent allowed outside during some months, and schools closed for over 2 years. I can tell it's had an effect on almost all kids his age. But I still wonder if it's the full explanation. 

Being smart may be part of the problem, because he uses words and concepts that other kids don't understand. But he's also bossy and gets frustrated easily. He's much too rough when he plays. He gets caught up in the moment and goes too far. And responds with violence if he feels rejected. He's also very much a sensory seeker. He chews up his toys and clothes, and gives bear hugs that aren't always wanted. Things I recognise from my cousins with adhd. But that his therapist says are normal.

It's unlikely that he will be able to get any support in school for either giftedness or adhd. But it would help us, his parents to support him in the right ways.

It feels so disheartening seeing him struggle without understanding. Right now people assume we're not raising him right, which feels awful and isn't true!

Any advice from other parents would be so helpful! (Or gifted/adhd adults)",0

Her doctor says that she needs special care as a gifted child and that maybe this will get her talking more?

"Fear of having children due to my own experiences I love children and would in theory wish to have children some day, but my own childhood experiences have given me pause.

An anecdote: I started speaking both Swedish and German at nine months and at age one I started putting together sentences with seven words. Unlike most, I started rolling my r:s immediately (usually children pronounce r:s as ""j"" here). I was nicknamed ""the talking baby"". While my kindergarten teachers found this endearing, it caused difficulties for me. I refused to go to kindergarden as the other children spoke in a weird manner (""dada and gaga"") and I did not know how to interact with them. Once I stood up in the bed when we were supposed to sleep and asked in a frustrated manner why there was no staff there I could talk to (pretty much word for word). Eventually I started pronouncing words in a similar manner as other babies, though according to my mum this period was brief and I quickly returned to a more ""normal"" manner of speech.   


This is just one example from my life, but there are of course more. At one hand I don't know how I as a parent would deal with a child similar to me - or rather how I would be able to help it navigate society. On the other hand, I am so used to my own way of experiencing the world that I'd not know how to raise a child that would be wildly different from me.   


How have you dealt with this? What are your thoughts? And so on.",0

"Thank you psychedelics TLDR; after struggling so much to heal from past trauma, struggling with to accept and love myself, especially my giftedness, psychedelics have saved my life. Psychedelics have transformed and healed me in was which conventional modalities like therapy and antidepressants were unable to do.


For most of my life I’ve struggled to be myself. I struggled to be confident of myself, to believe in myself, to be compassionate for myself and most importantly to love myself. 
For so long I hated myself. There were periods in my life that for months I would wake up and immediately become crushed by fantasies of killing myself or ending my life in some way. I knew that even in those time while I was alive, I couldn’t sustain the way I felt for much longer. I felt hopeless and helpless.
Years of pursuing therapy and being hurt by therapist, years of trying antidepressants which had no effect, so much time waiting and wasted and it felt like help was never coming. What made it so especially difficult I felt was my intelligence, giftedness and neurodiversity. Such a pain, the feeling of being too smart for most therapists, and those times I met gifted therapists I felt too different.
So in the process of seeking help for so much pain, I continued to be hurt. The trap of my own self hatred and loathing turned the failure and loneliness solely towards me. I blamed my giftedness most of all. It was a tragic irony, so many people would praise and compliment me for my mind and talent, yet I hated what they admired so much. It hurt to consider that someone would say how they wished they could be smart like me, then go home to their wife and family. While I go home and can’t even find someone to pay that understands me. I was desperate for so long, but in time desperation was another feeling I learned to ignore.
My mind, supposedly a gift, but at that time my greasy enemy. It forced all my feelings away, suppressed and ignored. I felt nothing and all I had was my thoughts.
Now things are so different than how they were just a year ago. While my life still has struggle and difficulty, loneliness and pain, I’m no longer a victim of anything and everything. I can authentically say I love myself, I love my life and I love the world and beyond. This state I’m in this beat I’ve ever emotionally been in my whole life. 
I live in an old RV on my parents property. Been unemployed for nearly 4 years. At this start of this period of my life, it was my lowest low. I’m still here, for now, and I’m at my highest high. I believe I had to be in such a disappointing and toxic environment to learn that my external environment is irrelevant to my internal environment. I don’t need a nice place to live or a job to derive my self worth or allow myself to love myself. Any disappointment or shame I may endure will not compromise my unconditional love I have for myself. I don’t need another person or societal construct for permission to for me to accept and appreciate me exactly as I am.
How did I do this, how did I have such a shift and change so much? Most simply it has been through the use of psychedelics. It was just a year ago I had my first experience. And while that one experience was transformative in its own small way, I’ve had a variety of experiences at this point, and that’s been exactly what I’ve needed. When I struggled to be understood let alone helped and healed by other people, psychedelics allowed me to understand myself and become my own healer. I was able to get the answers I needed from within. I was able to face my fears and my demons, fight them in battle and become my own hero.
While many of my experiences were enjoyable and fun, I was never doing this for the joyride. There were many challenging and unpleasant experiences, but those experiences are what I needed to be a me that’s worth being. Not simply to heal, but to become empowered. I found my own strength.
My journey with psychedelics started with a guide in non-clinical private sessions. I tried large doses of mushrooms, ketamine and 5meo-dmt. Eventually I qualified for a scholarship for clinically administered ketamine in ketamine assisted therapy. And most recently I’ve been exploring mushrooms on my own in private. Sure these substances can be used for fun or to escape. But when the intention is to dive within, to heal, learn and grow, so much is granted.
So I write all of this because I’m so grateful what psychedelics have done for me. They have healed and changed me when so much else left me hurt. And it was only after years of trying all the conventional approaches did I become desperate enough to explore such things. So i share this small story about myself, for others who may struggle in living their lives and struggle to love being themselves.",0
"Coping with existential pain Since I was young I’ve always been one to ask myself big existential questions. Usually these are just interesting ideas to ponder, and nothing more. But I feel as I’ve gotten older and my awareness has sharpened and increased, my existential musings have devolved into a sense of powerlessness that causes me a lot of intense anxiety. It’s really hard to go about your daily life when you’re aware of the fallacies of the systems around you, yet are equally aware that you have no choice but to participate in them. 

Unlike with other anxieties, I can’t tell myself that these things aren’t real, because they are. These questions don’t have answers and that reality terrifies me. I don’t know how to calm or soothe myself, nor can I shake this nagging feeling of hopelessness. It probably has something to do with me starting my early 20s and having to figure out my place in the world. But I’m not sure what to do. Can anyone help?",0

"I need some advice on my study method :) ! Hello hello

 in the begenning of my first year, I was kinda frustrate by the pace I memorize my Paper note for my undergrate medical school(I m in the first year),

When I read my  Paper note of my Lecture, I almost understanding the lesson, only one or three read is needed but I can't memorize (I was feeling not stimulate), for better memorization, I start make a synthesis of what I understand, My memorization sky rocket (30-45 hours to 7 hours)

But I noticed that I memorize even better when I read college textbook in my free time (other no-related field of my study) I can read only one time and I can rembember for  2 week - 1 month (I can be at my rythm and it more precise=>more stimulating)

I was thinking doing that with study related field, but I dont know if it is something recommanded to learn your lesson for textbook, I see a lot of negative thing.

If people can share you thought or advice me on this, Im verry happy

"Skepticism in kids I’m raising a gifted kid (8) and see a lot of similarities with my brother and I as children in not trusting the word of adults. Examples that have come up include: not believing that not flossing results in bloody gums, or that not every kid is going to want to play his games (very elaborate with complicated rules based on games or shows they haven’t seen), or that people think long nails are gross (because they’re constantly dirty and broken; we’d be having a different conversation if it was about gender norms). I’m seeing a lot of resistance on things that either have non-immediate consequences or social consequences, especially having to do with doing things he doesn’t enjoy. 

Like I said, I see similarities with my childhood, but I don’t remember any particular “aha” moment where that changed. I did fine long-term, but my brother still really struggles with learning everything the hard way - through personal and often painful experience, because he doesn’t take advice - and I’m afraid of what that says about my son’s future. And it’s baffling when he’s so smart.

I’m wondering if this resonates with anyone else, and if you can think of things that helped you move past this false self-certainty? I realize there probably won’t be a silver bullet.",0

"Don't tantalize over grades, chances are it means nothing in the grand scheme of things. As a grade 11 student, my biggest priority is my future and getting the best grades possible. Gifted kid burnout has hit hard though, as the time when effort is more important than natural ability has finally caught up with me. As a result, my grades have seen a noticeable dropoff from last year, causing a lot of built-up stress. I'm sure a lot of you are just like me.

If you feel you are sucked out of the moment by worrying about the next \~ 5 years, I encourage you to look at the numbers (not in the way you may think). I created a doc and mapped out all of my grade estimations until high school grad, one being VERY conservative and the other very optimistic. In my mind, the amount of stress led me to believe the difference between the two estimates would be above 5%. It was less than 1.5%.

Academics do not define intelligence or self-worth, so don't waste valuable life on the anxiety of what-ifs. Appreciate the world around you, and prioritize your mental health over a literal number on a sheet, you are more than that. You can do great things, so focus on the present and everything will improve.",0
"Am I the only one who gets bored of people? To explain briefly, I have a tendency to get bored of a subject very quickly. Some take me more time, and some are very fast. 

But this here is about getting bored of people. Today, it hit me that I had a tendency to cut off relationships because of boredom. If that makes sense, after some time, I am pretty much able to guess a person's line of thought. I will fast-forward conversations, and it tires me that they keep being so slow. This caused me to cut off quite a few relationships, because if there is no attachment (and by that, I mean a sense of duty to answer), I will just stop answering after some time. I always feel pressed for time, like a junkie needs to get more shots, I need to get more out of conversations; and after some time, I just let go.

It's very brutal, too. I'm writing this because I feel the need to type it somewhere, but I'm not even sure that I'll come back to reddit before some time.

"2E kids, what was your experience in gifted programs like? I was in gifted programs my whole life and the only one I found helpful was for specifically twice exceptional highly gifted and severely dyslexic kids and I feel like it should have been offered to all severely dyslexic kids, but unfortunately it’s even a not a thing anymore. All the other programs I was in that were for gifted kids, not specifically twice exceptional kids didn’t really do much for me… like they’d have events specific to people’s interests but they never did any of my suggestions, I feel like I was overlooked as a 2E kid and the other students often seemed embarrassed of me, especially when I’d call it Special Ed (it’s education and it’s special so it’s special education). I also got clumped in with the gifted kids instead of the other sped kids to do my IEP (I think cause I was in normal classes) and I never had enough time to ask for all the accommodations I needed because everyone else’s IEPs were only like a page long and were just about helping them ✨reach their full potential✨ while mine was the size of a novella and was mostly about things like getting lost in the hallways and randomly leaving classes due to over or under stimulation.

"Gifted with average iq? Okay i’m sorry if this sub gets a lot of these posts but i couldnt really find any other posts that answered my question.

When i read descriptions of gifted kids i find that i fit and have fitted very well in to that experience, a lot of stuff would make sense from my past if i think of myself as gifted. Those descriptions (which i found on various websites) didnt really mention iq but it seems to be pretty big criteria here. 

I took a short mock mensa test and my iq was around 100. I was a bit distracted when i took the test so i might have been able to score mildly higher but the result isnt that surprising because while i am very good at humanities i am pretty average at math.

It’s not just that i’m smart and conflate that with Intelligence, i am good at learning and finding connections its just more in terms of language and humanities and as mentioned before i fit well with the description of giftedness including the more subtle traits (feeling allienated, being very sensitive and curious, always had a strong sense of justice). 

Idk is it possible that i could be gifted? Its not that i want to get an ego boost i just want to understand myself better so i would like to know your honest opinion

"A lot of “IQ” tests seem trainable I took the online Norway Mensa test I think (test.mensa.no) for the first time and it says I got a 138. Obviously I know it’s not the real deal. 

But a lot of the questions are the same patterns over and over. I’ve never done a real IQ test but these seem extremely trainable. The only problems that seemed hard were the last 4 which I had to make educated guesses on while low on time. 

How much does a real test vary from these online ones? I kinda feel like some of the people in this sub are just tooting their own horn thinking they’re special or something. I wouldn’t say I’m smart, I was a CS major at a school relatively well known for the field, and there were those few people there who are just levels above the rest at math/cs. I did the whole math/programming contest thing in high school and college (AMC, Putnam, etc.) and once again there’s a clear distinction between people like me and kids with obvious talent. 

Just the speed at which they pick up new concepts and apply them to new problems is on a different level. I could train/practice for 10 years and still not have that raw ability. 

So yeah people say online Iq tests are bogus and all, but if they’re even somewhat similar to the real thing then literally explaining a few “tricks” to look out for to a normal person before the test seems like it’s enough to immediately get a lot of the puzzles/questions. 

And if the argument is that of course it’s trainable and your “real IQ” is what you get the first time going in completely blank, then what’s the point? There should be some notion of the test where no matter how much someone who is not “gifted” can prepare for it, they can’t do well.",0

"RANT - Lack of activities for very young gifted kids I suspected my son was gifted by the time he was 2 and we discovered he could read.  Though, I was maybe in denial since all I could find was early reading as a splinter skill for autism (had him screened several times- he doesn't have autism).  He is now newly 5 and has been formally tested as gifted, but it would be obvious to anyone even without testing.  He really gets into his interests which are all weirdly academic and I'd love to enroll him in day camps or weekend activities to support his interests but none of the groups ever accept kids with younger ages.  I feel like the whole world just ignores giftedness until 8 at the earliest and fail to make any real academic accommodations until high school or college.  Why is this? Obviously kids can be identified from toddler age.  His current interests are math, biology, chemistry, physics, and space -there are literally no events or classes for his age that aren't coloring sheets and learning the alphabet.",0

"How do you act when someone explains something you know to you? So my way of sharing deep thoughts/the things I know is by starting with the basic information (for example: it rains a lot in that place because there are many mountains). It may be due to masking, or just because it's my way of communication. But what it often results in is some people starting to explain the whole rest of the concept to me (like in this specific example, explaining why mountains cause more rain). Not everyone, but there are some people I know who are just huge ""explainers"" and do it especially much. There are also cases where I ask simple questions (like ""do you have your *own* computer mouse?""), and that person then says things like why do you even ask that, you also use a computer mouse, everyone uses one, etc. Or there might be situations where I want to take the hard way to solve a problem so I can challenge myself, but someone then starts to explain the easier ways and assumes I have no idea about how to do this thing either the hard or the easy way.  

First of all it does often make the impression that these people assume I somehow know less, even though I might know just as much as them. But mostly it's that I don't know of any polite ways of saying that these people do not need to explain. When I use the simple ""I know"", it often results in conflicts or the other person not listening. So how do you let such person know?

"Am I gifted? ( I just want people's opinion because I’ve done my research and I am very unsure) I (F19) got my adhd diagnosis 3 years ago, and it’s all making sense because my mom and her sisters are clearly adhd, and my little cousin is adhd too. My dad is on the spectrum and his brothers are neurodivergent too. I know it’s difficult to believe but for me it was normal to be like this, but the more I grew up the more I noticed how different we are from other people. My mom showed me a video of a French humorist talking about her giftedness. I saw myself A LOT and what she was explaining and my mom told me she wouldn’t be surprised if I was gifted. I want people's opinion because I just want to know more about myself. 

I was always very self aware. At 3 years old, I had a very clear and developed language, so much that the other kids were finding me weird. I was also extremely compassionate. I could understand and feel what other people were feelings. I struggled to make friends because I had this habit to talk about very serious and adult topics ( politics, feelings, etc ), and other kids didn’t want to be my friends because they thought I was boring. When I was meeting someone who was a lil bit like me, we could spend HOURS talking about serious topics. I don’t really know how I learned so much about serious topics when I was like 8. I think I was just always very observant and I was listening well without noticing, so I knew a lot about certain subjects and it was normal for me, and the adults were very impressed lol. 

I can understand and feel emotions. I am very sensitive with the way people looks at me, the way they talks, their posture, etc. I often helps people understand their own feelings. I explain to them why they feel that way and all the logistics around it. I analyze emotions and feelings in a very rational way. In my head, it’s an enormous schema. It’s all making sense for me. The problem is, I am too sensitive to this. I feel like I’m too conscious and I understand too much. This makes me prone to overthinking, fearing rejection, panic attacks, sensory overstimulation and this b*tch called anxiety. I feel too much my own emotions and other’s emotions. 

Adults tells me I’m very mature for my age. I see people my age as immature, annoying, unserious, etc. So I prefer being with the older adults so I can have decent conversations. But it’s difficult to understand too much…

"Hi all! How many of y’all are 2E (twice exceptional)? [2E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_exceptional?wprov=sfti1), in case you haven’t heard the term before, means you are gifted - in this context intellectually - but also have some sort of neuro or developmental disability. 

(Including: dyslexia, visual or auditory processing disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, sensory processing disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.)

I theorize that people who are gifted do have a higher rate of neurodivergence. For example, I have diagnosed ADHD which comes along with some fun comorbidities like auditory process and sensory processing issues. 

Even more so, and I’m not sure how much of it is gifted (if any), neurodivergent, or just my personality, but I have more trouble getting to know people and bonding. As an adult, the only people I’ve been able to become fast friends with have also been neurodivergent and/or gifted. 

One of the biggest differences I notice about my communication style compared to people not in the above categories is how I’m either pretty reserved or ‘nerding out.’ 

I tend to hyper focus on a topic for a while & learn as much about the topic as I can until I can have quite extensive conversations. I love to share knowledge with people and have them share knowledge in return. Even though I am in some ways quite reserved, I love learning about other people and their experiences & unique way of seeing the world. That is probably why autobiographies/memoirs are my favorite lit genre. 

Anyway, I find that reddit can be a kind of toxic place, and I have an annoying habit of either saying nothing at all or writing 5 paragraph very genuine essays (always on my phone no less!). Which doesn’t mesh well with many others style (it can be a bit overwhelming for the recipient, no doubt). 

I don’t really have trouble with social cues - more a general feeling of unease around most people. But I do love nerding out in a non-reddit-y way with like minded people (in other words people who have a love for sharing hobbies and knowledge without being patronizing those who know less). 

My experience is that the most gifted people I’ve met are those who are not just top of their class academically, but also highly intelligent in a general way. They tend to be more genuine, less afraid of admitting when they don’t know things, and are less likely to be exclusionary about interests or patronizing when someone makes a mistake or doesn’t know something. 

Anyway, I created /r/indepthaskreddit a few months ago for people who are quite intelligent, but also welcoming, often neurodivergent, and prone to writing essays if a topic falls into their area of interest / expertise. 

if you got this far and any of this  resonated with you feel free to drop by and teach us something",0

"Let's bury the multiple intelligences With this sub getting larger and larger, it also attracts a crowd that is not educated on research on intelligence to be perfectly honest. In the last few weeks I have read people going on about different kinds of intelligences. This is a ~~myth~~ aged theory that needs to die, especially in a place like this one. 

1. The idea that the brain holds different types of intelligence was founded by Howard Gardner in the 1980s. He theorized that there are eight (or 7, or 9 but these aren't the popular ones) types of intelligence: 
- musical 
- bodily-kinesthetic
- interpersonal
- verbal-linguistic
- logical-mathematical
- naturalistic
- intrapersonal 
- visual-spatial

It *sounds* nice. Everyone is good at something and an individual who fails at logical-mathematical exercises but is generally great navigating life on an interpersonal level would be intelligent in their own right. So especially educators have attached themselves to this theory and won't let go... 

2. Despite it being wrong. 

The theory was *immediately* met with skepticism within the field. Multiple, separate intelligences would indicate low correlation between the types - they have been found to be highly correlated though (whether one subscribes to the theory of the g factor or not) and increasingly so with cognitive testing coming closer to a correlation of 1 over the years. 

There is **no** empirical research to back the idea that there are separate intelligence or that these are some definable and differentiatable types of cognitive potential, which is immediately understandable given that the theory of multiple intelligences is so vague and arbitrary, that it cannot possibly be objectified or quantified - therefore it's not entirely falsifiable either. Gardner has come forth and said that MI being successfully applied by educators is empiric evidence for the theory's validity. However this reasoning assumes the validity of MI to prove MI, therefore it does not qualify as empiric evidence.

Most importantly the key part and why it's generally considered as virtually disproven as far as that's even possible is that the idea of these separate special areas in our brain is inconsistent with the findings in cognitive neuroscience. According to the current state of knowledge, different cognitive tasks share neural circuits. This would mean that they cannot be entirely separate cognitive tasks. 

(Gardner himself has admitted that ""talent"" would be more fitting than ""intelligence"" but that wouldn't have granted him any recognition; the next best thing he's famous for is opposing intelligence as a term all together) 

3. This does not mean that intelligence also defines ability, but ability is not intelligence. This also doesn't mean that we have correctly identified *all* the cognitive exercises that make up what we consider to be intelligence.

I am a 13m and man I am so done with being gifted ( i have an excellent memory like i read a book once and i can remember 97% in my own words and once i pick up something i learn and understand it really fast along with having the ability to make formulas and solutions in seconds of 1 pattern)  , is it just me or society just too harsh on people like us like everywhere you go there is the highest expectation from us and when we fail to deliver we get berated and abused like man if i don't get something people are like bro why cant you get and call me a few choices of words and then the teachers and parents are never satisfied with our performance no matter how much marks we get they are like you can do better like idk 38/40 is like a large room to improve but still they are like average do better next time i have never heard that sentence said to an average student. At this point i don't want to be gifted i it does is gives me more emotional abuse and depression never anything more than that. Do you guys agree?",0
"Problems of giftedness to which I found no solution for now. Hello everyone! I wanted to ask if anyone here encountered some probles which I'm going to discuss further.

Problem #1: I freaking hate when people talk about things they know nothing about. When I encounter this I just force this person to learn the lesson I'm teaching them, or at least I make them understand that it's better to not mess with me. I use various socially based and other tricks to put them under pressure that grows with time to until they understand my point.

Problem#2: I also freaking hate injustice in any form I encounter. There were many moments when I've started to defend some random person whih was subject to unjust treatment and, optionally, unable to defend themselves. I never avenge for myself really, but if I'm defending someone I can be really violent, and even though usually I put intruders under proportionate aggresive responses and risks but sometimes situation spirals out of control where I use disproportionate in power, very aggressive and/or violent moves to freakin  discourage any further interference. And sometimes this kind of relationship emerges suddenly, very fastly. For example, for some time while earning my BSc degree I was a neighbour of a woman who was abused by her husband who is alcoholic. I've tolerated two nights of fights behind the wall and then I just broke inside of their flat (the door was open luckily) helped to incapacitate her husband forciblyand called cops and local psychuatric/narcological paramedic team, they put him into specialized narcological hospital, eventually they divorced and this man was kicked out of this flat. So frequently I establish extremely intense but short-living connection to some other people, solve their troubles and leave them alone when I'm confident tht the person is safe and sound.

Problem#3: I nearly compulsively gain leadership in any group of people. Usually I gain leadership by mixing up charismatic and expert power types. So basically I weaponize knowledge very frequently.

&#x200B;

For some reasons this state of affairs troubles me. I know that in give circumstances I did the right things, but something inside casts doubts.

UPD:Thank you all, guys for your comments and points of view. I read every one and thought through them thoroughly. I thought and finally recognized that the construction of my personality itself is vulnerable to such problems. So, basically adding my multi-diagnosis psychiatric illness and some traumatization gets me right to these problems. None are about giftedness, and all are about personality and about filling hollowness with problems of others and not my own. Thanks everyone again.",0
"How do you handle feelings? I think through feelings. I have a very, very challenging time feeling my feelings. 

In therapy, today, we were setting up for an EMDR session that had just been making me tear up a bit. My therapist asked what the negative scenario made me think (easy to do). Then he asked how it made me feel, and everything sad inside me evaporated, and I responded ""I don't feel anything."" It was wild how quickly the switch flipped inside my brain and body. This is what I think I've struggled with so much is my ability to shut emotions off so much that I don't even recognize them as ""feelings"" but only as cognitive challenges.",0
"Learning I was labeled gifted in elementary grade after a psych-Ed, and mostly only ever saw it as meaning a higher than average IQ and consequently going to a special class a few times a week.

Multiple of my children have been diagnosed as ADHD or autistic (“gifted” isn’t so much of a designation in the country we live in now) and as I learn more about neurodiversities, I wonder how much of my giftedness has lead to my current state of burnout and what I should be doing to progress forward.

"Should I just accept life and move on? I'm  turning 30 this year. I found out I'm gifted only a couple of years ago  and it was an eye-opener on why many things in my life  happened/happens.

As I'm growing older, I'm becoming more and more in tune with my emotions. But I'm also  feeling more isolated, misunderstood, meaningless, alienated. I've had 8  jobs in 6 years. I've lost all of my friends and the relationship with  my parents is broken. Luckily, I have a wife, who is a highly-sensitive  person, who tries a lot to understand me, thinks the same about a lot of  things and is supportive.

I have  this cyclus of existential depression. I'm constantly seeing the  discrepancies between how things could ideally be and how they are. Most  of the time, I'm witnessing injustice, dysfunctions, and hypocrisies in  the world, but also other people's apathy and ignorance. I see how  things should and could be, but they are not shared by those around me.

My  father, who I suspect of being a narcissist, downplayed (and still  does) my feelings, my interests, my achievement, my life in general.  I've been silenced almost continuously and only 'socially desirable  behavior' was allowed. I have the feeling I live my life on 50% of my  capabilities. I now have a high-paying job as a Data Analyst (only  started out as one this year, before that I tried marketing, trading,  accountancy) and in 6 years my gross salary increased with 65%. But I  never tried my best to achieve this, I just went with the flow and ended  up here. I never have had the feeling of doing my best and actually  working my ass off.

I find it  difficult to walk the  conventional life path dictated by mainstream  society. I have difficulty finding true peers. I get bored and  under-stimulated easily and have trouble finding people who can  keep up  with me. I need a lot of alone time to process my thoughts.  Perfectionism and boredom makes me delay or sabotage tasks.

I've  visited 4 psychologists in the past year, and basically, they all said  the same thing: get over it. Yes, life sucks. Yes, people and society  sucks. Yes, it is hard to find friends. Just deal with it and be  stronger. Personally, this was a big disappointment. I feel as if I have  to cope with being continuously depressed and settle in in 'the playing  field', having a conventional life as mainstream society dictates it.  It was as if they all said: stop overthinking and stop being  ""different"". Is that how it is? Is that how my life will look like?  Hoping to find some peace in how I see things and accepting that is is  different from how most other people see it? Hoping that I find some  peers and some friends while I don't have a social life or hobbies or  friends right now?

The Cast

As they play with the strings of karma and fate,

Taunting and pleading, asleep or awake.

Taking the lead, inappropriate at times,

Controlling the others, as they speak their lines.

The set always changing with each passing word,

Sometimes the silent, the most loudly heard.

Through all of the scenes, director or not,

They all take their places, leaving few empty spots.

They exit the stage when caught unrehearsed,

While everyone thinking that they should come first.

So many are they that the program never done,

All at the same time, they are only one.",0
"growing into giftedness I first got my IQ tested in the 5th grade as a means to skip 6th, so my parents always knew I was smart, though I don't think they knew that being gifted was a thing. They always supported my acceleration, even when it meant graduating a year early so I could get to college. College hasn't been much better in terms of a challenge. I graduated with my undergrad a semester early and I'll have my masters by next spring. I always wished growing up that I had something to challenge me; I was constantly looking at private schools and dreamt of going somewhere with kids like me. I was the easiest of 5, though, and so all that sort of fell by the wayside. Now that I'm an adult I'm trying to make up for my lackluster education in childhood. I'm teaching myself Japanese and I'm hoping to start engaging more with maths and sciences. I still haven't managed to connect with other gifted people as much as I'd like to, but I'm hoping that will change.",0
"Finding out you're gifted as an adult Hi, first-time poster here. I was wondering if any other posters found out they were gifted as adults and whether the way they see themselves or their history changed as a result. 

I just turned 39 and got confirmation today. I never even considered I might be gifted until a colleague started reading about giftedness and wrote me telling me that she thought I fit the profile. I always considered myself smart enough but nothing really out of the ordinary, just good at some things. I never thought much of my achievements and I struggled to see that other people's thought processes and experiences differ from mine, that they might need much longer to finish the same task, etc. Routine testing at school was not a thing in my country when I was growing up. My mother always suspected, but I always thought that she was so young she could not possibly know and that every mother thinks their baby is extraordinary.

At the same time, I have been trying to explain some of my peculiarities for years. I always felt different growing up and I tried to give myself many explanations, blaming my upbringing, an unusual (for the time) family formation, a very abrupt change of life in early childhood, etc. I began to understand myself better after reading about high sensitivity, but that still left some elements that I was unable to explain. Reading about giftedness made me think about dozens of incidents from my past and it helped me to understand why they might have happened, which is somehow comforting and stress-inducing at the same time. It's also made me feel sorry for my teenage and young adult self, who consistently dumbed herself down and made herself a clown in order to fit in. 

Long story short, finding out I'm gifted as an adult has made me reevaluate my whole life and see many elements from a different perspective and I wonder if anybody else went through/is going through the same and whether their self-perception changed.

"Managing multiple inputs vs multiple outputs while thinking Hello, everyone! I would like to ask you a question about your experience with the manageability of different thinking processes. 

Disclaimer: I am not sure I am gifted. When I was at school in my country assessment wasn’t a thing. There are many aspects that make me think I could be, then other that make me doubt a lot. 

That’s why I am curious to know: if you have difficulties with multiple input intake while thinking, can you still be gifted, or may it point to a concurrent neurodivergence, or does it mean anything at all?

I have noticed that when I receive multiple complex pieces of information, I have trouble with them, unless I manage to merge them in a single thread. For example, I am bad at strategy games because I can only keep track of one front at a time. When I do mind calculations, I can’t retrieve the results of the middle passages when I need them because I forget them. I like sewing, but I find pattern making overwhelming because of the multiple geometric manipulations together with their own consequences (to me, Rubik’s cube is a mystery).

On the contrary, I am quite good at doing the opposite. Given a piece of information, I can easily see all of its ramifications like the branches of a tree, choosing the one I want to go along with and continue to the extreme. I was good at grammar because of this. Just don’t ask me to explore all the branches together.

Does anyone of you relate or know why that might happen? Thank you!",0

"Does anyone else feels this? Heey! I'm a very new account and a very recently discovered gifted person and I have a very serious question.
So... Ever since I was a kid I had this dream of living in a magical library with infinite knowledge where time stopped and all social interactions I would have were with animals, I would spend every single second reading abou everything and anything an learn about the world, this fantasy could just me escaping the bullying in real life I guess, but as I grew older I started to feel this extreme frustration on how I am a human being with a limited lifespan an will never know everything about everything. 
I love so many things, I wish I could study and learn all these different subjects with the same passion while also doing my several extracurricular activities at uni and learn everything about everything because learning is something so good... 
With my recent discovery of my giftedness this weird frustration started to feel even stronger... I would talk to people about it and they would respond with a ""that's what life is"" or ""just accept it"" but it's gotten to a point where it physically hurts thinking about it.
Does anyone else feels this way? How do I learn to accept the fact that the day only has 24h and I will not be able to do everything I want at the same time?

"doubting yr thoughts vs doubting yourself as a gifted individual (2e or not) I am new to reddit as an active member. 
What I observed in this subreddit so far is, that there are a lot of insecurities present, which I am way too familiar with. I also noticed that I sometimes have the urge and sometimes give into it in a way that translates to ""ok, I'm explaining to y'all what giftedness really is. I also dont give a fuck if you agree with me, cause honestly, you're just not as profoundly gifted as I am. so, we can never be friends anyway."" 
It's funny, isnt it, that we do it here. prove our giftedness, defend it before anyone even allegedly attacked us for being a know-it-all at best, a freak at worst. 
I crave true peers so much, you might call me desperate. I am for sure lonely on an existential level. therefore, I first want to prove to you all, that I am as intelligent as I (secretly) know I am, and you better upvote my thoughtfully crafted post enough (still wonder how many upvotes wd actually be enough.. a million?), so I dont have to condemn you. but.. contrary to how I show (off) myself, I do look for connection. meaning not only no translation necessary, but actually be able to empathize with my peers. 
i believe that gifted people are highly empathic and profit immensly from exchange with peers. most of us just never had this experience where they could truly be themselves and feel safe at the same time and we think we have to overperform to be seen - when did that ever work?
Its more than frustrating to be misunderstood, dismissed or ridiculed bc we dont make sense to some people. realizing that we can cause actual anxiety which has to be met with outright or covert hostility can be soul crushing..
we dont need to behave this way here, do we? 
we are too smart to bully or victimize our peers, its basically self-victimization. we shd help and empower ourselves and trust that we're being understood if we're ourselves.

"Thoughts on Making Friends & Intense Friendships (As gifted/neurodivergent) I often see posts here about the struggles giftedness/neurodivergence puts on making friends and I share a lot of the same struggles. I’ve contemplated a lot over the last couple years why I find it so hard to connect with others while incorporating the perspectives of this sub. So idk here are my thoughts if you’re interested.

&#x200B;

I broke it down to three parts:

*1. Defining Friendship*

*2. Communication & The Difference in Communication Styles*

*3. Maintaining Friendships (Intense Friendships)*

&#x200B;

**1. Defining Friendship:** Of course I started by questioning how I define friendship and what friendships meant to me (my therapist is proud ok). And even above that, defining what “relationships” meant to me, and breaking down each one, my life partner (husband), family members, and in our case of focus, friends. The theory that stands out most to me in regards to relationships is [social exchange theory](https://socialwork.tulane.edu/blog/social-exchange-theory/#:~:text=Social%20exchange%20theory%20is%20a,person%2Dto%2Dperson%20relationship.) and as of now I apply this thinking to all my friendships. So for example, although I will look for a [consummate connection](https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/community/slzctr/stdcsl/stdcsl_triangular.pdf) with my life partner/lover, I don’t need this deep a relationship with friends, obviously. For example, my partner and I have multiple interests that overlap and compliment each other, but my friends I may only share one-a few overlapping or complimenting interests (To clarify by overlapping interests I mean shared interests, and complimenting interests I mean an interest/hobby someone else has that you don’t but can aid your work/interests. Example: I’m an artist with woodworker friends). These interests are usually of use to each of us, resulting in an exchange (of knowledge, labor, etc).

**2. Communication & The Difference in Communication Styles of Gifted vs. “Normal”:** Okay now that we have established what relationships and friendships are, how do you communicate with them? (This is the hardest part) I still struggle with this, but I have one thought that I feel like is onto something. I heard a quote from [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM?t=228) recently that really stood out to me. He said: “*I was raised by nerds. Nerds need to interface with society in non standard ways. I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer review and normal purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict so nerds have to learn how to communicate with society at large*.” Putting it in these terms has eased so much tension for me in both what Bach refers to as “normal negotiations” and communicating with “nerds”. I often have an urge to share ideas, new things I’ve learned, talk in depth about my interests, etc. (it’s giving Dabrowski overexcitability) and sometimes people are apprehensive to the intensity of it, especially in “normal” scenarios. Although what I was describing earlier, with finding overlapping interests in all relationships could be seen as what Bach describes in “normal” communication as “negotiating alignment,” I think “nerds” have this deeper self-intrinsic force to gather knowledge to ultimately use in their work or be a source of inspiration. Maybe it’s giving selfish vibes but look I find friendships are difficult, gifted or not. Maybe these are the problems, nerds are selfish and just obsessing over their own interests (but not if you think of creating as a giving act, whole other story, but [this is relevant to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nje--J7fsfw) thought if you’re that intrigues you lol). I worry about this idea and its heavy reliance on a hobby or an output. I’m an artist and so are most of my friends so maybe I’m confusing a gifted thing for an artist thing, but I’m also friends with computer science nerds and feel it applies. Anyway, maybe this is just an expansion of my thought from earlier, we are all looking for similar interests, negotiating alignments, however these similar interests simply aren't enough for gifted people and we require something more than a pleasant exchange? We need some juice, something we can use later. Idfk this thought is a mess but feels like something.

&#x200B;

^(Last thing if you’re still here!!!!)

**3.** **Maintaining Friendships (And detecting threats of Intense Friendships):** To recap we 1, know what relationships are, 2 know how to communicate (barely) and now lastly, 3 let us *maintain* the friendships. This further expands on the last point, that nerds have these deep interests that they desire to talk about deeply and are looking to gather information as they go which can often be self intrinsic. This may be good for your work, but may not be good for maintaining a friendship. For me, I feel as if some of my friendships have been so intense they’ve exploded or idk. We would get excited and inspired by one another, work on projects together, and ultimately something would usually go wrong. Maybe I was a bad collaborator, maybe them, maybe this is an issue beyond giftedness, however if it does tie to it my assumption is the failure may be associated with this selfish drive. I sometimes get hyper focused on my interests that I push aside what others are eager to express or talk about. I think one possible solution to this is an aim to be more altruistic and put effort into caring about your friend’s interests (which will take *effort*). Your motivation can still at the end of the day be self intrinsic in the sense that maintaining these relationships will be beneficial to you, and if they get something from you (exchange) you will probably for longer be able to get what you need from them. Also collaboration is an important part of creation, creation is never quite so personal as it may feel.

&#x200B;

Dang, sometimes thinking through relationships like this feels so cold, but it’s just reality. We are just navigating through this primate originated extension of a social system and it’s definitely not ideal and a puzzle. So far the tips I have ultimately taken away are: Dive into your interests, see how others fit into that, and be ready to communicate well!

Ultimately I’m just curious if anyone else has thoughts! I hope I don’t sound insane, I’m very open minded and just working through these thoughts. I recently reunited with a lot of my old gifted friends and felt a huge and surprising urge of inspiration and positivity. I think friendships are super undervalued, at least here in America where I live, and I'm curious to solve this issue a little better to have better friendships and be a better friend.

&#x200B;

Also I like using “nerds” over gifted lowkey haha.

"Consistency in relationships For gifted people in general, and 2E folks in particular: how easy or hard is it for you to maintain long-term relationships?

"The ethics of medicating away our over excitabilities Hey y’all!

I’ve come to a point these past 6(ish) months that I’ve been put on stimulants in order to get my work done (freelance writer). 

I believe this is medicating away some of my over excitabilities, as I have no trouble focusing on things I care about. The problem is that all I can do is think about my interests and spend my days researching them unless I’m medicated to buckle down on work. 

Especially since I’m in front of a laptop all day with no boss besides myself. 

I’d love to be able to pursue my interests full-time but it’s not financially feasible. 

Does anyone else feel like they’re medicating away their over excitabilities for the sake of functioning? How do you reconcile it?

(I am diagnosed with ADHD but am unsure if I agree or not. But the stimulants help me pay the bills, therefore allowing me to pursue my interests when I’m not working.)

"Intense interests, escapsim or a mixture of both? Gifted individuals tend to have ""special interests"" and to feel much more intense about the interests they do have even if they're not particularly special. 

My mind's usually quite caught up in what silly little hobbies I'm currently fixated on. Sometimes I do wonder though, how much of that is just intensity in itself and how much is escapism due to having issues with conforming to a society that wasn't designed with us in mind. 

If I'm not doing all that well from a mental health point of view, not being able to focus on my interests makes me spiral pretty notably. Is that because I need to ""leave this world"" for a moment or am I just more vulnerable to the negative effects not having my stimulatory needs met has on my psyche in general or both? 

What do you think? Do you experience something similar? Are you perhaps even able to talk from a more educated position?",0
"Recently been diagnosed (?) as gifted by my therapist I am 29. Recently been diagnosed, if that's the right word, by my therapist. Apparently my therapist told me that I was gifted several years ago too. I remember it now. I remember that I didn't give a shit because I was very very depressed and didn't care for anything. 

I have very low self-esteem. I met very few people with self confidence as low as mine. It affects my performance in everything. I have general anxiety disorder also. I have so many interests, but I cannot do any of them because of the anxiety and the low self esteem. I am failing at work (I might get a less than 'meets expectations' rating this time) and it's absolutely killing me. I feel like a big failure. The last two weeks have been especially hard. I have managed to keep the existential dread in control for the last few months, but the last 2 weeks - it's hitting me every minute. I feel very sad. Life feels meaningless.

"An apology Hi everybody,

I want to thoroughly apologize for my post yesterday. I was rude and selfish for no reason. I also misrepresented myself, as I do feel quite alien a large majority of the time. We hate in others what we hate in ourselves, I suppose. 

I’m sorry for anyone who felt further alienated by my post. I’m happy to chat in the comments or in PM’s about this. 

I’d like to take responsibility for my actions but please do not attack me. I know what I did was wrong and am already beating myself up about it; I don’t need external sources beating me up too. 

As a bit of an explanation, I have (probably level 2) autism and have trouble expressing my feelings appropriately. This resulted in a very rude post that didn’t reflect my actual emotions. 

I tried to remedy the situation in the comments and in post edits but it got out of hand so I took the post down. 

Context: Yesterday I made a spicy post shit talking people who feel alienated and probably made them feel even worse because I misrepresented myself as well-adjusted. 

I hope the people I hurt will see this and feel comfortable talking to me about it. 

Thank you for reading! I want to be a positive, contributing member of this community and in order to do that I need to own up to my mistakes.",0

"Relationship while being gifted I (F20) have been together with my girlfriend (F21) for about 3 years. Things are going okay and I ‘think’ I love her very much.

I find it very hard to explain what I’m feeling, but I’ll try (english not my first language). 

As a person I tend to overthink literally everything, e.g. my mom is taking multiple flights soon and I’m almost instantly crying because I think of all the possibilities it can go wrong. 

I do the same with my girlfriend. I’m obsessing so much over every detail. I’m questioning things like “how do I know if I REALLY love her” or “why do I feel a bit of X emotion when I’m with her, while I should feel happiness”. Everything she does, I’m thinking about things like: “Do I even like it when she does X or Y??”. 

It. Never. Stops. It’s driving me crazy, sometimes the thoughts go so fast I can’t even state clearly what I’m thinking about. In the end I’m often worrying if we’re a good fit.

However, when I’m really tired or drunk or anything else, I often (not always) think “why did I worry so much, I love her”.

I hope there is someone out there that gets me, since I’m not sure if this is a thing of my giftedness or it’s anxiety.",0

I am 15 now, and have been traumatized multiple times early in my life: my grandfather died from a heart attack in front of me at age three, I have been effectively injured by my schizophrenic father at the same age, and a traumatic event occurred in therapy with my father. I also know a person of comparable intelligence who had also been traumatized at age five due to the passing of his mother. He is age 15, and doing calculus III—not unlike me.

"How do your overexciteabilities show in daily life, what bothers you and what do you appreciate? I'm often overstimulated by sounds and smells or complex lights. This makes it very exhausting when driving to university.
Also, when I'm into a topic, I cannot stop thinking about it. This sounds nice on one side because it brings joy and I learn a lot in short time but on the other side it is also exhausting because my mind cannot shut up about it and everything else is just not that interesting (to the point where I think out loud when half asleep about it or waking up and having an idea and try to prioritize sleep). When I get excited I need! to move or sing to regulate myself. But this sometimes hinders me to actually do what I planned ironically because I only have short spaces of free time in our family's routine (to invest myself into an interest). 
On the other side I love! Listening to music or play with my imagination and it comes naturally, like reading a very good book or watching television but it's fun!

I never got diagnosed. I was too smart to have a problem. I was just cocky and pretentious. Adult would get mad when I’d use a word they didn’t know. I felt dumb. I never thought I could be gifted until my therapist talk to me about it.

It wasn’t just my mom. Most adult in my life (teacher, coach,etc) told me stuff like a kid shouldn’t know that or you shouldn’t read that. You should be normal and have girl interested. They told me that i needed to calm down because i would never have friends. 

But i kept quiet because I thought I was a burden and awful to be around. This followed me into adulthood and I still have difficulty accepting that people like me and like hearing me talk. 

My gf always talk about how much she likes listening to me and how smart I am but I don’t believe her. In my heart I still feel like she’s just lying because she loves me.

"Gifted x Autism x Average Joe \- I've always been told I write really really well (English not native language), at the same time my vocabulary has always been average. I don't ever recall using an out of the ordinary word when I'm writing or talking to someone.  
\- I can read people quite easily and am very sensitive but all my life all I heard is I hardly express emotions (I guess that's more in the everyday life like I don't show surprise, excitement, etc).  
\- I have a range of interests, am super curious but learning is actually quite challenging for me. I don't learn stuff easily. And my memory is TERRIBLE.

\- I'm a loner, have very few friends and find it hard to connect with other people. At the same time, I never really had any difficulties in my social life, the few friends I have are normal people that don't think I'm out of the ordinary. It is hard to explain. I know how to fit it, but if I allow myself to be myself, most people seem to be overwhelmed (I joke and talk too much, etc.).

but apparently it's outdated since Asperger is now within Autism Spectrum. and the thing is most of what I highlighted in the ""Gifted"" tab are not signs of giftedness but only things that don't occur in autism. For instance, ""Aware of social norms"", ""Engages others in conversation"", ""Interested in team sports"", etc. These are all things most people would also check, which led me to think I might just average, after all.   
I never felt different than other people, or at least I never really paid attention. but the more I research the more I believe I'm somewhere else than where most people are. At the same time, no definition really seems to fit me.

"Vocabulary and being misunderstood. Recently, I've been noticing how often my friends and family stop and ask for the definition of a word I've used during conversation, or simply just stop me and state that they don't know what a word means. These requests can be kind or straightforward, but often are teasing, snide, exasperated, or downright passive aggressive. Sometimes it's an obscure word, or jargon related to my work, but more often it's a word that I feel is normal and common. 

It feels as though it is happening more frequently . I think it might be that I am an adult now, and so instead of being a cute, precocious gifted kid, I'm being perceived as a pretentious adult who is using these words to stroke my own ego or show off. However, that's not the case. I don't think about the words I use until someone makes a comment like this. Then, I become hyper-aware and feel like I have to tone myself down to engage with my peers and family. 

I'm not sure how to deal with it. I feel like changing how I talk would be patronizing. Assuming people won't understand me unless I talk more simply seems incredibly rude, but several people in my life have told me they don't understand words I use or that talking to me makes them feel stupid. The issue has been brought up several times recently, which makes me wonder how often it is happening and not being brought up. I don't want my friends and family to not understand me or feel that I am talking over their heads. It's alienating and frustrating and makes me overthink everything I say.

"How to get through work that's boring My main freelance writing gig is getting quite repetitive. I'm even considering going back to being a groundskeeper because of the versatility of the day, being outside, using my body, solving problems, etc. It may not seem like a glamorous job (and it's not) but it's one of my favorites that I've ever had.

That being said, there are a lot of perks to remaining a freelance writer- one of the main ones being that it gives me a lot of extra time to pursue my interests and work on courses related to the field I want to enter (herbalism). Not to mention being at home with my family, which is truly priceless. Those two things are huge incentives that I think I will miss dearly- and likely regret giving up- if I start working a full-time job that's not WFH.

So, how do I make it through a boring day in order to keep these perks? Some things I've tried (to various degrees of success, depending on the day) include:

\-Using herbalism studies as an incentive

\-Working in chunks with study, cleaning, and workout breaks in between

\-Making my writing as perfect and interesting as possible

\-Looking at the financial benefits of getting work done

\-Writing a list of reasons to work at the beginning of each day

\-Working outside

\-Changing scenery throughout the day

\-Listening to music that's only listened to while working

\-Using coffee as a ""cue"" that it's time to work

And more. But I usually end up spending the day researching what I find interesting instead of doing my work. I wish I could just study all day but that's a luxury I don't have. Finding new clients is on my mind but it's a financial leap of faith that I'm not quite willing to take right now.

Any tips on doing work you don't find interesting? I know I can't be the only one in this boat.

Thanks :)

PS- I likely wouldn't actually be able to change jobs considering my disabilities. It's mostly just a pipe dream, and the fact that I'm considering it is just a sign of how unhappy I am.",0
"At stanford having an identity crisis... rant,vent,personal story idk anymore

I am attending Stanford and recently I have been feeling like I am not supposed to be here. Like I have worked all my life to get yet I feel like it is not me. ig a little backstory: I was recommend by a teacher to get an iq test, got the test done (twice actually), scored a 159 and 163 then got sent to public school. public school didn't work for me so i got sent to a gifted school. It was very competitive. I actually remember on my first day thinking that it would be fun and I would meet a lot of people but also that i would be better than everyone (yes 7 yr old me was a bit humble lol) anyway the school was not like that. everyone there was very smart and VERY competitive (little me didn't realize it would be like that despite it being a gifted school lol) I thrived academically and wasn't really scared or challenged so to say by the intellects of my peers but I was how ever not ready for the sheer level of ig you could dedication and competitiveness. what i mean is that everyone did so much and we were only seven! Like everyone was taking lessons in multiple instruments, playing multiple sports, writing novels, doing academic competitions, giving ted talks etc and while I was doing as good and even better on tests and stuff i was still really behind when it came to extracurriculars and stuff. so I realized that I had to be better than them. That my smartness was not enough and I needed to be applying myslef. So did it. By the time I had graduated I had learned 4 instruments, won music awards, learn 2 more languages, wrote 2 books, published research, started clubs, ran businesses, created charities, interned at hospitals, played sports, won academic accolades,  won science fairs, competed in math competitions, studied aboard, done robotics and more all while still taking very advanced classes and being in the top 5 percent for gpa. I did, I did it all. How could stanford reject me now? how can I be inferior to my classmates now? I was the perfect prodigy that everyone wanted... and now im here at stanford. I feel like a failure because I don't think this is what i really wanted. What i wanted were good friends and fun. Not a packed schedule and fake competitive friends.  I only did this because this what everyone else wanted. Now idk anymore its to late to go back and I am stuck. My childhood is gone and I am entering an adulthood that I am not ready for. This wasn't supposed to be me. I wasn't one of the kids that would do anything for an internship. I wasn't one of those kids who only got joy from doing and talking about all their extracurriculars. That wasn;t me. THat was my classmates but not me. I wasn't meant for this.  idk sorry if this is messy. I also feel kinda stupid for complaining about this cuz ik this seems like a first world problem lol",0
"How can you not know that you are smart if you are gifted? Every once in a while, I read someone here mention that they didn't know they had above average intelligence before they got tested. I can understand that happening to those who are twice exceptional, as conditions such as autism and ADHD can interfere with performance at school and affect how people perceive one's intelligence. I also understand it when it happens to people who suffer from very low self-esteem, in particular when they have abusive parents or teachers. I've seen it happen. Otherwise, the phenomenon is a little hard to grasp for me.

Is it a Dunning–Kruger type of effect? Sure enough, apparently people in the top quartile tend to underestimate their skills, but if you are gifted (say, in the top 2 percent of the population), you'll have to underestimate your intelligence by a lot to regard it as just average, won't you? Bear in mind that estimation and according placement are cognitive tasks that gifted people tend to perform well. For me, simply pointing to the Dunning–Kruger effect is a very lazy explanation.

Thinking of my own experience, I was told I was smart from an early age, before I could even care about such differences. A little later, it became clear to me that most of my peers were slower, had more difficulties with language, couldn't handle abstractions or reason as well as I, etc. I am not profoundly gifted and have been fortunate to meet people who are on a different level compared to me (though not very often), so it's not as if I were only looking down. Moreover, I was a curious kid who read a lot and so I knew early on about prodigies such as Pascal, Hamilton and von Neumann. I knew I was not that intelligent. But I never doubted I was well above average, and I understand it would have been foolish to think otherwise, given all the evidence.

Another point to consider is that, often, when smart people say they are not very intelligent, or something of that nature, they are holding themselves to very high standards. They are saying they are not as smart as some paradigmatic genius of their predilection, or just not as smart as they'd like to be, not they are not above average. So, while it's something you may hear smart people say all the time, it's not to be taken literally.

What's your take on this? Is it frequently just false modesty? Did it happen to you? If so, how do you explain your wrong evaluation?",0

- Be advised all sort of things, and all wrong, cause none of them freaking understands me but they all assume I want the same as them. They cannot possibly have an idea of the cosmic distance between my experience and theirs. Therapists, friends, parents, teachers, you name it.

- Be pitied and treated as naive because I say things like ""this is not fair"". Apparently only children say that

- Be alone like I was the only being in the whole universe. Finding and thinking and feeling the most beautiful things, being so excited, and being met with a wall of flat faces. Making jokes that people don't get. Getting so goddamn bored because people talk about the same things over and over like a broken record.

I'm really good at summarizing and understanding people based on minute cues. It's basically pattern recognition. With this, I've developed reeeeally good masking skills and utilized them my entire life, since I can remember. It's led me to useless relationships, platonic and romantic.

So since I decided to try to stop masking, dating has been very not fun. I met a guy who, on paper, is smart (he went to Yale for a PhD in biology stuff; that's supposed to mean something, right?). So I thought, ""Ah, nice, I won't have to go easy on him."" And in a matter of max four hours with this guy, I heard and observed some things that added up to borderline personality disorder; this did not deter me. He told me that before we got too deep, there was something he needed to share. I guessed (because oooo, game!), ""You're bipolar??"" He was taken aback. He did not confirm it but took the convo elsewhere. Days later, he told me mental health is not a joke, and yes he has BPD but has been in treatment for it, I hurt his feelings, etc. And that was the end of that.

Everything I talk about will be of my own experience and own beliefs 

What gifted means to me~gifted to me is to define a person as skilled or bright in some field whether creativity or intelligence whatever it may be, early in my life I was deemed “gifted” this gave me a sense of purpose finally oh this is why I can’t relate this is why I feel different etc etc in reality that was not the case I had crippling social anxiety preventing me from making friends not because I was smarter or gifted but because I was awkward and couldn’t hold conversation 

Now that I’ve given you a basic sense of what gifted means to me I want to tackle people using it as an excuse 

“Gifted” people using it as an excuse for poor social interaction~ people genuinely may have genuine things impairing their social life but for the majority it is not that case the two most prevalent reason I see for “gifted” people to not have a social life is being 2e and feeling disconnected to get 2e out of the way I’m 2e and my social life is more than healthy I have adhd, mild case of Asperger’s, and a stutter all things that could lead to bullying and I did get bullied but a hard life make a strong man and I overcame my troubles to become social like I used to be jealous of, now feeling disconnected I too feel this no one gives a shit about my interests in psychology and philosophy highschool is not the place for those thing but if I am gifted I should be able to use my brain to figure out how to be social and I did, I was able to split my personality in two and I succeeded I studied alter egos and made myself one one side of me is smart and stoic the other side of my personality is funny, charismatic, and social; if you are smart enough to be considered gifted you should be able to research how to be social and get rid of things in your way using the term gifted as a reason for not being social is a cop out

"The overuse of the term gifted Obviously there is genuinely gifted people or we would not have the advances in the world we do.

I was labeled gifted and am mediocre and average at best 26 act and only one of two hard classes far from the heights gifted should be held to I am just average.

Obviously I can’t deem when or when not a word should use but I do however think we can all agree it is overused for kids that’ll be mediocre. but what does the sub think I’m interested",0

"My story: college at twelve # This may seem fake, especially considering the nature of my profile; but is true.

Here is the story of my life, which was not achieved alone—if it were not for many kind people in my life, I would not be here today.

Despite not yet being interested at math—my main interest—I will start this story at the age of seven years old. When I was seven years old, I excelled at reading. I read 300 and 400 page books—designed for people double my age—at this tender age. I would read through these books and come back to the libraries for more. However, I am not as interested as I used to be in the humanities. English has still been a significant factor for what I am today.

When I was nine, I discovered both the joy of mathematics and music—my main interests today. Let us start with mathematics. When I received my student handbook at this age, I saw the back of the book; full of formulas and notations for all grades of students. The notation had me simply fascinated. I bought a math dictionary at my local library fair. In these books, I learned the meanings of notations as high as calculus—for some I only learned the concepts, not the procedures. A friend of my mother's friend was a retired mathematics professor. He started to teach me math *for* ages 12 to 14. For my tenth birthday, he gave me my first graphing calculator and taught me to program. Being a troublemaker at school, I was moved to a different class that fortunately had two phenomenal teachers. They also taught me algebra: simplifying expressions and square roots. Unfortunately, at age 12 these teachers became out of reach—I was transferred to a different class. My family's only choice was to send me to college. At age twelve, I tested into 11th grade math (also taught at the college), and college English—which was unexpected; giftedness in humanities is often subtle. I am now 15 and have been inducted into a honor's society. I am currently taking calculus II, general chemistry I, American History, and music classes. Every math topic taught to me in college seems familiar and therefore easier; I have learned all the notation and concepts, all I need to learn is the methods.

I also have shown giftedness in the field of music and composition, but will not discuss it here since I have final exams to take care of.

"Cross-language ""gifted"" Hi there !

I am kinda curious about this sub. I wandered a bit, and it looks like people here only refer to the notion of ""gifted"". In my language (french) we also have a term like that (""surdoué""), but don't use it at all, as it is quite outdated. We mostly use ""neuroatypical"", as well as a variety of subterms that helps better characterize an individual person (Autistic spectrum, ADHD, High IQ, hypersensitive,... ). These terms all are part of the ""neuroA""  domain, with each one having its own characteristics.

Do the english speakers also use such terms ? 

I am also curious that I didn't find a lot of english literature about this subject, or perhaps it is not as accessible/visible as here ? I would really like to discover other countrys/languages perspective on this subject.

Are there any active communities in the US, UK, Aus, NZ or others, beside this subreddit ?

Looking forward to exchange",0
"Giftedness and frisson experience? Hey gang,

Wikiscience says: frisson also known as **aesthetic chills** or **psychogenic shivers** is a psychophysiological response to [rewarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system) stimuli (including music, films, stories, and rituals[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson#cite_note-3)) that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise [positively-valenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)) [affective state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)) and transient [paresthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia) (skin tingling or chills), sometimes along with [piloerection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piloerection) (goose bumps) and [mydriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydriasis) (pupil dilation).  

For me, it's very tingly skin and goosebumps, major goosbumps, over large patches of skin, and it feels nice.   I don't get the shivers or chills kind.  I'm a 2E type, so I'm wondering how other people experience it.  I guess people get this most oftenly listening to music.  I don't know if the ability to get goosebumps is even considered a gift?

Some people hardly ever experience fission, others more.  I would rank very high on the 'easy to frission' scale. It has been happening to me for all of life.  I don't get it from music much, but I certainly used to.

"People often misunderstand me I don't know if this is common for most of you, but I assume so.

I (F,22) was diagnosed gifted when I was 5 (+ extremely introverted), and social interactions have always been difficult for me. I make an effort to genuinely smile and be assertive, but there's a pattern: Others often misunderstand me.

I try to be gentle and tactful because I know that sometimes I can be very dry. Still, people often think I'm disinterested, weird, or sometimes rude. I don't want to be the life and soul of the party because that's not who I am. But I want to express myself better.

I've been in therapy for depression and other issues for years, and my psychologist knows I have trouble interacting with others. She says it's difficult for me to connect with others due to giftedness but doesn't really give me options or techniques.

Guess I wanted to know if many of you deal with this too.",0

"How do you study? This year I'm doing a degree in Computer Science and it is like nothing I've ever done. High school was easy, I tried two other programs at university which were easy but was bored af and sought something more challenging... Well I got that! Which is nice but now I'm stressing because I seem to have so much trouble with studying!! The longer I try to go along with the teaching methods, the more miserable I feel. I constantly run into problems and things I don't understand and everyone seems to just get it?! I feel incredibly stupid most of the time as I don't understand the simplest things. 

We get weekly assignments for every course and I have so many questions and unclear information that I end up taking extremely long about every assignment. Throughout the first weeks of the period I don't understand anything and I just quit studying because no matter my effort; everything is a mess, jumbled, unclear, frustrating me terribly.

And THEN at the end of the period I finally have the entire overview, I look at the assignment and the solutions, I understand it, remember it, use the information on the test and pass the test. The problem is that this makes me do everything at the last moment and meanwhile I'm wasting my time awfully, throughout the entire period! I feel frustrated all the time because of this.

I am completely incapable of knowing when what I say isn’t appropriate and this means I end up hurting people unintentionally… a lot. I mean no harm, but it’s incredibly frustrating to have pretty much no friends at all. I ask people to tell me when I say or do something wrong, and sometimes they do but it doesn’t make them want to be around me any more than before. 

I spent a lot of high school trying to socialize with other gifted people and that didn’t work. I don’t even get along with people that I’m supposed to be like. People always tell me to put myself out there, be myself, express my interests. I’m an extrovert, I do that stuff naturally, it’s just that nobody else is receptive of it.

"Are you ever really happy? Growing up, I was known as a smart kid. In school, I was completely bored and assumed school is meant to be boring, and should not be exciting. Around 11-12 years old this turned into complete apathy and doing absolutely nothing. I sort of managed to get through high school, and only really got into problems at university. I lost a couple of years, and had a very hard time teaching myself how to learn, discipline, etc.. But ultimately succeeded in getting my masters degree. After a few years in industry, I started a PhD.  


If I look back at the last \~10 years (since I really started studying at university), I can see I constantly tried to become smarter, and made career moves to be around brighter people. The idea that I'm underachieving is sort of ingrained, and I keep thinking that I can achieve more and more.  
This process has made my life substantially more enjoyable, but I keep struggling with focus, work-ethic/discipline and most of all, performance anxiety. Deep down, I'm never really satisfied, and often procrastinate (videogames, reddit), and often question the meaning of it all.

&#x200B;

I suppose (part of) my story resonates with many of you, so my question is, are you ever really happy? Is it worth it trying to live up to your potential? Or should I learn to be happy in a comfortable, dumb job and let go of my ambitions (and focus more on my family). How do you find the right goals that keep you happy? How do you manage existential questions?",0
"Highly gifted + ghosted by my industry In 2018, I worked for my first company out of grad school. I had a narcissistic boss, who fired me for challenging her ideas, then told me I am an idiot and should never work in the field. I sort of remained under the radar for the next few years working at another firm. Turns out, they most likely communicated and I now have a name within the industry as a trouble market.

It is not fair because I worked very hard, and I always worked in the company's best interest and was super loyal. No one believes me because I am highly+ gifted and do not know how to communicate my ideas.

But either way, how does one move after something like this happens? I mean, I decided to just quit the field, but I feel it's so unfair that I got pushed out of the field. Not because I was a trouble market, because no body understood my ideas. I guess the usual gifted stuff. But, dealing with an entire network pushing me out because no one believes me is painful. I guess I have no choice but to let go...

"finding a focus point Everything is interesting and everything is worth learning.
This in essence is my greatest gift as it is my biggest point of failure. My whole life i have had loads of different hobbies and interests, in school this is already caused problems and irritation for myself. I cannot seem to focus one thing.
Now it is career time in my life since i failed in school i started working in restaurants at the lowest level. In no time i became a skilled host with a vast knowledge in alcoholic, taste and everything that is enjoyable to eat and drink. I honed my skills in service and hospitality. But as with everything in life i got bored and long for more.
So with a load of luck i switched to a tech desk job in climate systems. Guess what? Offices are boring and most of the collegues are stupid so my mind checked out and after a while i checked out aswell.

Never ever i seem to be able to find a focus point something i can put my teeth in and become an absolute expert. I'm doomed to be a near expert on nearly everything.

"I (23F) feel weird, advice? Last year I went to a therapist about my thoughts. I never felt like I fit in. I don’t like the same things other people my age like. Eventhough I am surrounded with friends, I still feel alone. I never really met anyone with the same interests and way of thinking. I like talking about stars, black holes, medicine, Philosophy, museums, psychology, chess, puzzles. I don’t like small talk. However, I have nobody to talk to about these subjects, or to play chess with.
My therapist told me, after only five minutes of talking, that I am gifted. But she couldn’t be of any help. I never got tested, although I (not very serious and quite quickly) took the online Mensa IQ test and scored 132.

When I talk about random funfacts, my ‘friends’ will laugh at me and call me weird.
I never liked partying, I can’t seem to understand how that is any fun at all. There is no possibility to have a conversation. There are too many people, the music is too loud and the light too bright. Besides, Alcohol is highly toxic, why would you want to drink that? 

There is one guy I know who is also (highly) gifted  and understands me on a deeper level, but he is chronically depressed. I have tried to be there for him during the past three years. But because of his depression he doesn’t have the energy to be there for me in return. He tries to change himself in order to fit in and I slowly had to watch that happen. I sometimes wonder if that is what I should do too.

At the moment, I am starting an MDPhD in vascular surgery. But, as weird as it might sound, I feel bored. I lost motivation and I don’t see the point anymore. My head feels clouded. I also have a strong urge to just go and order some math books. I miss the challenge.

Last but not least, I can’t seem to handle my intense emotions at times. I don’t understand people and this world is simply too cruel for me.

"Skilled yet difficulty working a career? I generally had an easy time of school and college but a 9-5 career feels impossible. I quit my fancy, remote, high-paying job ~8 months ago. The work was well within my capabilities difficulty wise, however I feel like I burned out the first 2 months at 40 hours a week. I tried coasting but I wasn't sure what ""enough"" was, so I always felt like I was never doing enough. I was afraid of failure and getting fired (although my boss never mentioned that). 8 months in my anxiety was critical and I couldn't just keep pushing through. I wasn't allowed to do part time so I quit.

I've just been doing freelancing since then. It's better although I'm hardly paying the bills honestly. I feel like a dumbass given how much I used to/should be making/my peers are making.

Did finding this community make you feel understood, less alone? Did it bring relief and peace to some extent? 

I don't necessarily mean that you stopped feeling different or alone, but rather if it felt like a complete answer and like that was the only, ultimate reason for those feelings, and you didn't need to continue to look for explanations. If not, did you continue to feel like there was something missing? Like there were parts of your life and self that weren't explained away by giftedness alone, or like you didn't quite fit in the community or relate to the gifted experience fully?

It was not overt, but in sort of subtle ways that they would try to get under my skin (imagine all the babyish things a preschooler would do - side eyes, teasing, laughing at you and the like). I think part of that may have been due to the fact that I got quite a lot of attention from the guys in my school due to my good looks (not bragging, just trying to paint a picture here). Also, I am a women of colour and my high-school was in rural hick country if you know what I mean, so it’s possible bigotry was involved too.

In the last year, I have found out that I am gifted and have ADHD. I love the academic environment for the learning and stimulating atmosphere but I continue to struggle with having to color inside the lines and meet constant deadlines. I have been at CC for the last four years and just transferred to university this semester. I thought things would get better once I was taking mostly classes for my major because they would be more interesting—and they are. I also joined Honors so I could write a research thesis, which I’m also enjoying but there were a lot of more hoops to jump through than I expected. I’ve also been trying to get accommodations but the accommodations they want to offer (lecture recording, basically) won’t help for what my struggles are, and the things I think would help (flexible deadlines) they don’t want to give me. Here are my two major issues:

1) Having to do everything the way I’m told is demoralizing. I am a creative person and like to do things my own way, coming at them from angles other people tend not to think of. When given the freedom to work in my own way, I work at a graduate level but being forced to do menial tasks with what seems like ridiculous requirements is SO frustrating and makes it feel pointless to me.

2) I get super overwhelmed with the amount of tasks I’m expected to do, constantly churning out one assignment after another without any time to actually sit with anything—things I actually do enjoy and want to learn.

I want to go to grad school desperately. I love learning more than anything. But I don’t know how to keep up with these expectations. My mental and emotional health are suffering. If there are any divergent thinkers out there who successfully made it through college with some mental health and dignity in tact, I would love some advice.

"Adult but not slowing down Is anybody an adult who is not slowing down? I feel like I only want to do and learn more and more and more. 

I was always a curious kid. I remember when I was young, and I would jump from this topic, to that one, read this book, start writing a book, collect this, collect that. I was always a ball of energy in one way or another.

Then I lived a sheltered life which was very incompatible with who I am. People around me tried to force me to be their idea of what a smart person is so I didn't do much in my younger years. I was to produce grades and not much more. 

The overcontrol and sheltering only made things worse. There is so much I missed out on. Much of it I could've been doing 20 years ago. I think that people think if I they stop me from doing things or discourage me, then I'll stop being myself. I am not a piece of clay to be molded.

"Parent of a gifted ADHD child looking for some advice Hello,
   Thank you for checking out this post. My 7 (almost 8) year old son was clinically diagnosed as both gifted and having ADHD. This is our eldest child so some of what we're dealing with may be due to inexperience on our end. We are trying to determine if his personality traits fall inline with the above diagnoses or if there is something else we need to identify. All advice is appreciated.

Going to refer to my son as Fred (not his name)

Fred is entirely caught up in his own world. He is ultra focused on 2 or 3 different things. Mostly related to games, imagination. 

Fred has a tough time playing with other children because he wants to control every aspect of games. He has a wonderful imagination and ability to make games very interesting but refuses to allow others to control aspects of the game. 

If Fred is forced into a situation where other kids want to do something other than his ideas/games he is happy to wander off and play by himself or another group. He's not particularly attached to friends but seems to enjoy time around them. He may have one or two really good friends over groups of them.

Fred has a hard time reading people. He gets very emotional when he realizes that something he did upset someone else but doesn't often see it beforehand. He is very blunt and will tell a waiter the food took too long to arrive if we're not careful.

Fred often prefers the company of adults over other children. He will chat up random adults he see's before even considering playing with a kid he met at the playground. He's not shy.

Fred is chaotic good. He will absolutely follow the rules to a tee and will not allow people to cheat. If I speed a few km over the limit while driving he will let me know.

Fred's teachers have all said they love him in class and that he's very helpful to other children when asked. 

Fred almost never gets invited to birthday parties or play dates.  

These are just some examples of what we're seeing. We want to help guide him towards becoming a well rounded individual. We are on the fence about exposing him to more doctors to see if there's anything underlying that we should address. I'm hoping to get some insight into that. Thank you!",0

I am a teacher at a high school in a foreign country, recently moved from a primary school position. I probably spend a good, full 5-7 hours a day lesson planning and 2-3 hours teaching. This position has been extremely demanding on my creative, logical, and decision-making processes such that I no longer have much energy to think outside of work and making a good experience for the students. The work of education is intellectually interesting for the sake of figuring out how to perfect my craft, but that's it. Once I am sufficiently proficient, it too will pass from my curiosity, I fear. The tedium of keeping up with the excess work is detrimental too, I think.

This is all on top of a fuller social life with the move I had made out of home about a year ago now. Most conversations with others revolve around work, drama, and other futile exercises in keeping the mind busy. People who enjoy curiousity and discovery for their own sake are strikingly few and far between, and most are bogged down in struggles (emotional, of maturity, philosophical, etc.) that I feel like I've moved far past. It's difficult to appreciate these kinds of people anymore, and yet I still feel drawn to them in some more baser sense. A friday night at a bar with pizza and cocktail in hand in some other universe, shooting the shit.

This life so far, though so full, feels so empty.

Compared to my life before the move, during covid (the first 2 years in the US*) and even in college, I no longer have much time nor energy to deeply think and consider the things I used to care about intensely, including in language learning, philosophy, history, sociology, and so on. I love doing these things. While the experience here at this place of work and this country are greatly beneficial to me, I can't help but feel I am losing part of myself to the environment,  the people, and the work...

:::::::::::

Here's where I pass the ball to y'all -

How do we preserve what makes us gifted in the face of life?

I've been thinking a lot about things like overexcitabilities lately - how do I continue to remain bewildered by and to foster the senses, the intellect, the imagination, emotions, and body in general when the life around us seems to dampen them at every turn? I feel like they are atropheing. They are being crushed under the weight of life.

To abandon my social life? To change my line of work? These measures would be too drastic, but the less radical alternatives are not clear to me.

To force myself through a book in my down time, or to wander the streets aimlessly, waiting for my mind to bite some hook? I can't really do these things well unless inspiration truly strikes.

:::::::::::::

I believe this kind of worry is not one only borne by myself. I'm looking for some perspective, some experience of going through this perhaps inevitable part of life.

Thanks for any pointed comments.",0
"Does anyone else here play TTRPGs as a way to connect? I ran some 5 dimensional dungeons for some of my friends in college and they enjoyed it. 

It’s an interesting way to present my internal thoughts as fictional structures, which I find is a great way to get people to understand how I think.",0
"How do I cope with knowing too much? Recently I have come to a conclusion that puts me in a position where I cannot help but to analyze everyone deeper than before. I understand the way people think and come to form beliefs, how they form reality around them. It has done nothing but put a further wedge between me and other people when we interact, and make me even more suicidal because I cannot relate to anybody I communicate with even more so.

I should use radical acceptance but I really can’t. It feels like I see everything five steps ahead of everyone else and no one else can. I feel so much more alone than I ever have in my life and it really sucks.",0
"I'm sure I figured out quantum entanglement, after 3 days of thinking about it! So, the story is, I'm an engineer who does engineering work.  I don't know a thing about quantum physics, but I was forced to consume a few papers that came out recently.  I'm researching to compile a list of reasons why quantum cryptographic key distribution technologies are probably not going to work out.  Trying to work out of 'cost of cohesion' and what it might imply for TCO of different systems, normal engineering stuff.  Anyway, I had an interesting notion occur to me during the research.  I have thoughts and questions. I'm not narcissitic to think I'm right, but I'm smart enough to still ask the questions anyway, even if I look stupid.

What do we do when have interesting ideas that are totally out of our field?  This is my actual question.  I don't know any quantum researchers to ask.  I have a feeling there might one or two amongst this set of folks, so I thought I'd share this here.

I was trying to figure out a way to describe how we entangle particles, what they do, and what really happens in reality, but for engineers.  Then my stupid brain spit out a notion that conforms to what's what's called the ""hidden variables"" theory and explains away the spooky part of entanglement.   Apparently some people think entanglement can be explained by adding a 5th dimension to reality(Einstein was curious), but why do we need to add anything to our 3 dimensions and time.

The Feynman diagrams seem to hint at a particle having a quantum state in 1 dimensional space over time.  Particles are obviously real and flying around all over the 3d universe, it's only when we create conditions to that isolate atoms and particles do we seem some emergent quantum behavior.  You can excite an atom of rubidium by shooting it with a laser such that it creates two new entangled photons when it calms down.  Both photons are ""born"" entangled to the rubidium atom, until some other particle's quantum state crosses the timeline and messes it up. Because their quantum states were created in 1 dimension, they are spinning next to it's parent rubidium atom quantum state, regardless of where the particles go in 3d space.  They conserve angular motion because of this adhesion, which could simply be something like weak quantum gravity.  They are entangled in a ""non-local"", yet still related, dimension.

I'm very interested to hear the opinion of somebody who actually researches the field, but what if what we see as entanglement is just the result of a 1 dimensional quantum universe?  Every particle has it's own unique quantum state, and they exist in lower dimension space and are sticky, but not strongly adhesive.  In that reality, there are only 1 dimensional quantum states, altered by 1 dimensional quantum interactions and separated by spacetime gaps.

I guess that would imply the universe to be entirely entangled, we're just seeing what happens for brief periods where we isolate the particle group, until they rejoin everything else?  I assume to be wrong, as this does imply the idea that ""we're all connected"" is actually provably true.  Nobody wants to listen to a bunch of gloating hippies.  It certainly doesn't imply anything about the existence or non-existence of God or some guiding force, which is where these kinds of debates often wind up.

Any actual quantum scientists in the group?  I asked over on their subreddit, and it's been crickets.",0
"Do you recognize these feelings? How do you cope with them? As a child, I've always felt lonely. I had to pretend to be someone else in order to fit in, to be accepted. As far as I can remember, I never 'really' felt like a child although I acted childish to overcompensate. I was only able to respect teachers if they treated me like an adult or an equal. My parents felt that there was something ""off"" with me, and I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. I resisted that diagnosis from day one, as most symptoms did not apply to me. I had to take medication for years on end, which made me feel numb and not myself. The medication and all the years of pretending to be someone that I am not have made it incredibly difficult to be myself. To know who I really am. I feel like there is something 'deeper', a layer underneath everything, that is very hard to reach. Who am I? Which parts are real and which parts did I make up to fit in?

Later on, I learned that ADHD is a common misdiagnosis for people with HSP and giftedness. Learning about those two things has made a lot clear about myself. Now I know why I seem to feel every tear, every bomb, every bullet. Why I feel the pain that others feel. Why I feel an intense love for others whereas I am constantly frustrated by how poorly we treat each other. I finally understand why I did not have to do much effort in school. Why I felt like an imposter during the PhD but why the PhD did not felt like an achievement afterwards. I reach milestone after milestone, but I feel almost nothing. One achievement is simply a step to the next one. It never feels like it is enough, and no achievement is able to fill the gap that I feel inside. Why it is so hard to be proud about any of those things. I don't think I've ever been proud about anything. When my first relationship of five years ended, I was depressed for three years. I cried myself to sleep every night, it felt like I would die from pain. When I love someone, it runs through every atom of my body. But even now my depression is gone, I cannot say that I have ever loved myself.

And yet, people sometimes state that I can be perceived as arrogant. But I am not arrogant. I am so, so, so unbelievably insecure. But if I don't know myself, how could they possibly know me? I still feel lonely, even though I have a great family, good friends and a partner that I love very much. But I can feel incredibly guilty. Guilty because I can get incredibly frustrated when I have to explain something twice. Guilty because I can feel incredibly sad and full of pain for no reason whatsoever.  Guilty because I never had a partner who stimulated me intellectually, which I crave so much. I love her enormously and yet, I miss a deep connection. She understands that I am ""smart"", but she has difficulties to understand what I feel due to the HSP. Sometimes I am afraid that I have to amend with the fact that I am an outlier and that my partner will never truly understand me.

Does anyone recognize these feelings? How do you cope with them?",0

"Taking care of your brain Hi! What are your ""secret"" methods of taking care of your brain including nutrition, dealing with overload, keeping your life fun and balanced, dealing with stress, and perfectionism, and so on? Recently, I have decided to accept my difference as a part of myself and to stop pretending being normal. I would love to find ways of taking a better care of my brain, because during last years, I wasn't really taking care of it. I would love to get back where my brain activity and creativity used to be, because I really often feel like being ""muted"" and my ideas feels too useless to be thought thoroughly. Also, I am quite insensitive when it comes to other people's feelings. It didn't use to be this way.

So far, I have discovered these methods:
- meeting with friends regularly and often
- trying to sleep enough (I've been failing in this one since childhood, but I do my best)
- exercising
- working
- spending time alone
- being kind to myself and others (this one, I am failing as well)

I am considering methods such as these, but I haven't tried them yet:
- drawing during my mathematical days to relieve the tension
- eating sugar when my mental activity drops (I am not sure about this one)
- eating seeds and nuts on a daily basis
- doing more of the useless stuff that makes me weird on the outside but happy in the inside (like solving a Rubic cube)
- maybe some kind of training of memory and/or skills in studying itself?

Please, let me know, if I am overthinking it.

And I would also love to hear your stories about accepting yourself and allowing yourself to grow and be happy ""differently"" ever after. Feel free to share your thoughts.",0
"Thoughts, more info, and a discussion on ""The Dark History of IQ Tests"" by Ted Ed Animation Here's a video I just watched:

[https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-dark-history-of-iq-tests-stefan-c-dombrowski](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-dark-history-of-iq-tests-stefan-c-dombrowski)

I'm curious to hear everyone's opinions, if they have any other related facts or resources about IQ tests, general discussion, etc.

Let's be mindful of the sensitivities of this topic and have a meaningful discussion about it. It's common for privileged groups to ""intellectualize"" the real life experiences of marginalized people, so let's maintain the humanity and dignity of those negatively affected by IQ tests.",0
"Why is literally every close friend I have a genius? TLDR; my closest friends and exes all tested 140+ on empirically valid in person tests. My sister just got tested again and got 148. We used to have the same scores that weren’t in the gifted range. How do I know so many people in the 1%? Do friends gravitate to people of similar general intelligence? Or how else am I finding them and they are finding me?


My partner studies intelligence in grad school and it’s brought something back circling through my mind that doesn’t seem to make sense. 

Literally every single close friend I have as an IQ of over 140, tested in school. They’re also twice exceptional except two. Statistically that seems highly improbable. 

My closest best friend has an IQ of 151 tested in elementary. (ADHD and probably ASD)

My best friend from high school before her had an IQ of 163 tested in middle school and another time after that. (ADHD and ASD)

My closest friend post grad school just told me her IQ is over 140. 

Two of my exes (and now lifelong friends) both also have an IQ of over 140. One with ADHD

My current partner has not been tested  but as he studies IQ people are mentioning they think his is very high and he’s decided against pursuing his own assessment. (Because we really shouldn’t take this too seriously.)

Aren’t people 140+ supposed to roughly make up 1% of the population? 

What makes matters more jarring for me right now is that I’m realizing there might be a genetic disposition to me being used to giftedness too. My cousin grew up as the “child genius” memorizing his marine biology college textbook and quoting from specific pages when he was 3, so by contrast all of us felt we were, well, not geniuses. I think his IQ might be in the 170s. My siblings and I were tested as kids a couple times and the the one just a bit younger than me got the same scores, 119. Both of us are also neurodivergent. 

As a personal note, I used to be so frustrated because I was so deeply bored in class that I’d feel my youth was being wasted so after school I’d just spend time in my room actually learning on my own. I would read descriptions of being twice exceptional and cry because it sounded so much like me. Just as a couple examples, I could clearly rhyme before I could speak at 7 months by pointing (like pointing to a buckle and then a  knuckle etc.) In middle school math class I would draw diagrams depicting my developing model of reality and the cyclical nature of our universe and became staunchly morally relativistic. I’d always quickly get the concept of things and be able to have higher level discussions but would struggle with little details like writing down the wrong number absentmindedly or finding the right string of words because I think in pictures and videos.  And I was known in class to ask the questions nobody could answer. But alas, I didn’t really fit into any group in order to get the support I needed to feel I was being challenged. And I felt socially isolated as well. Well long story short that same sister just got retested and now her score is 148. Her processing speed is slow because of the ADHD. And it stirred all those old feelings again that perhaps other neurodivergent family and myself fell through the cracks.

I don’t want to get retested because any score would result in pain for me. I’d prefer to have a lower score if anything because at this point in my adult life there are no supports to encourage my intellectual growth anyways and my brain has not helped me feel mentally or emotionally connected. I’m happy with the few friends I have and our conversations are stimulating and fulfilling.  But now I’m wondering how it is that there are so many geniuses in my life. 

Am I just an intellectual pet who happens to be interested in abstract theoretical topics and therefore I attract people who are more prone to abstraction?  I always feel we’re on a pretty even playing field but maybe they’re humoring me. Am I attracted to twice exceptional people because they’re what’s familiar? What’s the common denominator? 

Any insight from this community would be helpful. You’d think this is something my partners masters would have touched on but it isn’t.",0
"Incertainty about looking for diagnosis/medical support Hi community!


For years, or maybe for as long as I remember, I've been struggling with certain aspects of myself. Sometimes, I think it might be giftedness, but everytime doubts hit me. Am I as intelligent as I feel? Are there other explanations for what I'm experiencing?

I never had much trouble in school, worked hard but not excessively, and was usually below the top students. But I learn quickly and have very broad interests.

Now the things I struggle with most of all is the feeling of frustration when my peers make - in my opinion - stupid decisions, or overanalyse everything instead of just doing what needs to be done. Sometimes I wonder how they could have the same job as me (I'm a pharmacist btw). I have switched jobs before because of this. Could that be because I'm simply more intelligent, or am I just a narcissist?

I hesitate to mention it to my GP, because I'm afraid it will turn out to be quite different than I would expect. 

Opinions please!",0
"What do you like about your giftedness? I've been lurking on and off for a few months. As a gifted adult, I completely understand the challenges giftedness brings, but I've never really felt that my giftedness was a burden or curse.

I enjoy being able to try something new and being able to understand the basics in short order. Being curious about the world has always been a joy, and rocking trivia games is always fun.

"Am I really gifted? Tomorrow I will be turning 17.

I am currently in high school and am the one of the, if not the, top student(s) of my class of 400 students in a very famous school in India. However, I am in perpetual doubt about my abilities. 

I got 133, 135 and 133 on mensa.no.dk and.fi respectively with a 136 on mensa.lu. I also did the tri 52 and got 805 (~137.7). On the cait, 142-143. And around 140 on all pro tests in the cognitivetesting wiki. 

Ever since I was a child, I showed signs of intellect to my home tutor who had commented that I have a sharp brain. Also I would dissect each and very toy I would get to look what was its inner mechanism. 

BUT I showed no signs of what a traditional gifted child would show. No early speaking. I am not much interested in reading and my reading speed is merely average. I also act very dumb at times. My father used to literally bully me saying that I was not clever when I was 6. 

My grades were great in elementary school but dropped to failed grade when I shifted to my current school. In grade 5, after my lowest point, I got serious in studying and became one of the best students. I topped the entire class several times. I taught myself a bit of programming (python) in grade 6 when I got access to a computer but it was not something very extraordinary. I can solve pretty much any programming problem that my teachers give if given time. When I was 9, I  discovered zeno's paradox and my childish mind had thought that I had discovered something new when actually it was a concept that had existed for years. 

Recently I have been diagnosed with mild OCD, subclinical level depression and anxiety. I have been into some philosophical conflicts for some years and am undergoing therapy. They tested me using Weschler Bellevue Intelligence Scale(WBIS) test costing around $12. I got 128. I was a bit depressed after that score. I feel I underperformed on that day as I was recovering from cold. I can easily remember 9 digits fw and bw but the performance was merely 8 on that day. My performance varies, I have discovered. 

My mental calculation speed is also slow. But I am good at math in the sense I can easily comprehend it and apply it. For example, I discovered the 'counting rule' of permutation and combination all by myself when I was in grade 6.

I am stopping here. Please try to resolve my doubts and be honest. If you require any more info feel free to ask in your comment. 

Thank you.",0

"Can life circumstances like seizures or psychosis lower IQ? Hey everybody!

Upon recommendation in a comment on another post, I took the following test:

[https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/)

NOTE: I am not the user who this test was recommended to, I just saw the comment and figured why not.

And...I got an overall FSIQ of 98. My official IQ test came out to 136 but that was in early elementary school.

A lot has happened in my life that- and I don't know this for sure- may potentially drop an IQ (serious seizures and EXTREME psychosis. I can elaborate if need be). I don't know if there's merit behind this but I've certainly been...slower since my years of incapacitation. Does anyone know if there's any factual evidence behind my theory?

The online test itself even recognizes that online tests aren't accurate. But that seems to be the most reputable one based on my gatherings. And if I'm truly gifted wouldn't my score be at least...not 98?

Admittedly, I didn't really take my time with the test whatsoever. But still.

Sincerely,

Identity crisis officially unlocked

EDIT: I just found this at the bottom of the test intro page: ""There is not much benefit to taking a super long time on the test, but if you speed through in less than 10 minutes your scores will be much lower than they would otherwise be."" I definitely sped through in less than 10 minutes. So who knows.",0
"IQ and Giftedness Edit: [new test results - age is not taken into account](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/results.php?data=HRY141dcc7JH)


Generally, a gifted person is defined with iq in the 98th+ percentile. I am just turned 15 few weeks ago and I did a Mensa IQ test in person last month where I scored 76th percentile for Cultural Fair (I did it in England but I was born in Hong Kong, so English is technically my second language) and 75th in Cattell B Scale (again, I don't take this as serious as it is not my first language), so by definition, I am not gifted. However, when I was fairly younger, I was nominated by my year 6 teacher (5th grade for those in the US or other part of the world) to a gifted program HKAGE, so I am confused now... Therefore, I thought I am just give some observation and see what this subreddit thinks.(Please note: [this is an update to an old post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/w9mrik/maybe_i_was_never_gifted_or_is_this_imposter/))

For:

* I have strong academic interest:
* I was promoted to a year 12 Music class instead of my regular year 10 class
* I am doing some A level maths in my free time (year 12 or 11th grade)
* I am 5 topics ahead in maths class (my teacher tend to give me next topics when I am done with one)
* I also enjoy learning quantum physics or any physics in general
* I like doing maths problem during my free time
* I was in a gifted programme called HKAGE in Hong Kong
* I am usually ahead of my class in maths, physics and music
* I have common gifted ""syndrome"":
* I get easily upset by poor grades
* I am usually the fastest to finish in class tasks with good quality work (according to teachers) in most subjects and teacher would often tell me to slow down.
* I sometimes feel bored in class (it is more like I want to ""fast forward"" the lesson like a youtube video)
* I generally find my use of language rather formal and advance to a certain extent comparing to my age group. For instance, I got 13 in terms of my fog index with my Reddit comment history.
* I have a strong sense of justice and I feel offended when people are not following rules which can often lead to me feeling negative intense emotions
* I struggle to relate with my peers (but I suspect that might also just because of my poor social skill, selective mutism, autism and social anxiety?)
* I am somewhat logical for most of the time.
* I was part of my primary school's STEM competition teams and we used to win competitions each year which is held by Hong Kong's leading universities.
* I also tried one of the past paper of UKMT Intermediate Maths Challenge for year 11 or below (""10th grade"" or below) and I got Gold award  in year 9 (8th grade).
* ""Straight A"" (but that might not be a sign of giftedness in particular) and usually get around 90-100% in assignments of subjects I care but sometimes could get as low as 75% for subjects that I don't really like as much.
* I picked a language rather fast: I managed to be better than my class who have been studying Spanish for 2 years more than I do and picked up BSL to a beginner level in one day, learned finger spell in 15 minutes.
* I enjoy debating on philosophical topics
* I can sometimes answer questions in science subjects or maths where no one could answer (by answer I meant type in the chat as I am online homeschooled)
* I like abstract ideas more than concrete ideas
* I remember being able to answer school question that was for my older brother (4 years older than me) when I was 5 
* I enjoyed learning science at a young age 
* I was always the one people find for academic help or for homework. 
* 50% of my lesson time in school ends up being me waiting for the class.

Against:

* I failed my maths exam twice (once in year 9 for all silly mistakes and once in year 1)
* I only started to learn some linear algebra and calculus in year 9 (8th grade) on my own during my spare time
* I was not as gifted as other story told in this sub by other parents:
* I struggled to memorise all 26 alphabet when I was younger
* I do not understand knowledge as fast or as easy comparing to how I was few years ago (but that might also be the increased difficulty?)
* My family would often consider me as dumb or ""r3tard""
* My Mensa IQ test score (75 or 76th percentile)
* I got 125 only in Mensa's Norway online test when I was 14 (for 16-17 years old, that was the youngest option)
* I think I am not as knowledgeable comparing to other gifted individual my age
* I am only ahead of my class for serval subjects but not all
* My knowledge can varies a lot in even one subject:for instance, I know some uni level physics but I do not know some of the GCSE physics content (a national exam in England and Wales for year 11 or ""10th grade"")
* I tend to give up on stuff quite easily when I was younger
* Unable to understand certain use of language, like sarcasm
* Sometimes could get as low as 75% in assignments for subjects that I don't really like as much.

Side note: Also now that I am 2 years ahead in Music, what could I do with that?

"Turning things into ""puzzles"" Not sure if this is related to giftedness or just a weird thing I do!

I love finding connections and linking things together. The whole ""correlation doesn't always equal causation"" things drives me nuts. It's just so crazy for me to think/know that so many factors can influence something, but we can't always 100% know why, or that it can be a combo of things or events.

For example, I have this weird thing of analyzing people. Maybe it's just the work I do (supporting kids with special needs/behavior concerns and developing strategies to meet goals) but I find people are fascinating! I take tidbits of conversations with people and kind of make a mental map of maybe why the way they are, have a certain outlook, or anticipate how they will react. I also see a lot of good in people, like maybe the things people get irritated or annoyed with are a result of ""x"" causing ""y"" in my brain if that makes sense. I wouldn't say I'm totally naive either.

In general, I'm very social, and I think I'm super easy to get along with. I love chatting with people and getting to know them! I also just love learning about cultures, history, and other people in general. 

Is this a gifted, work related, or a ""I've been through some shit"" kinda thing? Or am I just weird??  Tell me I'm not alone!",0
"Why can I never display my emotions properly? This post is more to vent, but dang I always have troubles with displaying my emotions properly. I do constantly get told by people that I don't seem thankful, that I often seem angry or sad, that relationships with me feel one sided, etc... and it is just starting to become too much. I tend to look at most things logically, so to me, it is enough to for example give someone a big hug and say thank you (because you know, these two actions get the label ""thankful"" in my head. If you are thankful, you hug someone and thank them). But there is always something that's actually missing and that makes people think I am not thankful, or whatever emotion we are talking about at that moment. There are also instances where according to my standards (and standards of the people who are closest to me), I do display an emotion properly but the other person has much different standards and is so sure that their is the universal one. I just find it so difficult to adapt to people sometimes. Obviously you should not adapt to others in exactly every way (one should also keep their own standards), but then the people will start pointing out the stuff you do differently and it ruins so many things (had many experiences like that, even got kicked from a friend group because of this). I find it really hard to judge whether it's me who's correct or the other person unless I also ask others about it, since I can see everything from varying perspectives.

What's even worse is that on the inside I am very emotional and even the smallest thing can make me feel intense emotions. I do generally feel guilt for so many things and I often am empathetic, but since I can't display it in a proper way, it goes to waste so often. According to people, it just rarely is enough. Well and people not thinking it is enough only makes me more emotional inside. What's more though, is that I rarely can even label the emotions I feel. Someone may ask me how I felt at a certain moment, and I will be able to recall the emotion almost exactly but I won't be able to name it at all (it also happens that I never pay attention to what I feel in the first place).

I am now getting professional help with all of this but the process feels so slow and it feels that so many relationships of mine are just getting ruined (in some cases I even feel that it's getting worse and worse). I just wish I could express myself in a way so others would be able to understand me.",0

Problem is that I cant seem to just accept advise, I naturally question every idea for improvement thrown at me to make sure it makes sense in my head and to actually be able to eventually use it.

But I feel like others can turn those thoughts off, just accept the advise given and act accordingly. This also applies to other more physical tasks.

At this point I do irritate the other players, because for me asking about and discussing certain moves is helping me understand and deepen them, while my trainer just asked me if I can just stop backtalking.

"I finally understand... Hello all,

I rarely post anything on reddit, but this time I want to share my experience with you all, as yesterday was probably the most important day of my life. I'm going through tough personal experiences (breakup, father health problems...), but it pushed me to realize something very important. (TLDR at the end).

**""Gifted"" Background**: In ***2020*** I stumbled upon an article about gifted individuals (in France we call them ""HPI"" which stands for ""Haut Potential Intellectuel""), and related quite a bit while reading about the common traits gifted people have. I talked about it with my girlfriend and my family and they agreed I was onto something and said I should go see a specialist and get tested, which I did in ***2021***. Took the WAIS IV and scored 127. My score is very heterogeneous, with a strong dominance on the verbal part and the visualising and understanding of complex concepts. 

**About me**: I (27M) come from France. I'm a tax lawyer and currently work in tax advisory firm in Luxembourg. I have the most amazing and caring family and girlfriend, and the most amazing friends I could possibly dream of. Yesterday, I realized I'm slowly losing it all because I refuse to see and act on my complexity.

I always knew something was ""wrong"" with me, and often tell my parents that ""I don't function properly"" without really knowing why. Here are some of the characteristics of my personnality (i'll only cover the most problematic ones):

\- I'm a very ""intense"" person: everything I do or feel is x10. I act and talk impulsively. People often see me as **overwhelming**.

\- I have extreme emotional overexcitability: intense feelings, strong empathy, strong emotional attachments. I **overreact** a lot (e.g. catastrophization and overthinking).

\- I'm constantly thinking, thinking about thinking. I love theory, and take great pleasure in debating and explaining my ideas. I know I can easily see and systemize complex problems. The problem is I overintellectualise everything, always. I’m intellectually independant and have struggle respecting others opinions. I'm a **complete bully** without even realizing it when it comes to debating with others. People see my as a ""know-it-all"". It sucks...

\- I have high expectancies towards myself. I'm perfectionistic, self-critical, and dwell a lot about how I act and how I can get better at how I live my life. This part is crucial because paradoxically I don't realize how my complexity affects others around me, weird huh? This makes me seem as **critical and intolerant toward others**.

I absolutely need to face those negative sides about myself and to learn how to mitigate them. 

**What I finally understood yesterday:** After getting the results and the confirmation that I am somewhat gifted, I wasn't bothered and just went on with my life : that was a **mistake**. I did not understand (or refused to see?) that being gifted is hard and it takes time and effort to mitigate the negative sides.

Until now, I've always thought a lot about how people seem me and what they think of me. That's why I studied law, passed the bar, went to work for a lot of money away from my home, from my friends. That's what successful people do right? For someone who's supposed to be ""smarter"", I'm baffled at how evidently mistaken I was.

Until now, I've lived my whole life thinking about what I need to do to be successful rather than what I want to build my own success. **Yesterday, it hit me like a truck:** I won't be happy in life thinking my success comes from making big bucks in big law. Maybe I'll keep doing that, who knows? But whats most important now for me is to realise that my real challenge lies in taming my complexity, to shape my giftedness in the most beautiful way possible. I need to learn how to appreciate what I have, rather than pursuing happiness like its not already there. I need to do it for me, but also for the amazing people I have around me. I deserve to experience, and to give back more of the good sides of being who I am rather than the bad ones.

I feel like I've learned more about myself in a week than in 27 years. Its scary, but it feels good.

Thanks for listening. Have a great day.

&#x200B;

TLDR: After having lived the first 27 years of my life thinking I need to impress people and to live up to my capacities to feel successful, I've come to realize that my personal success will derive from accepting who I am, working on myself, and doing what I want rather than what I feel like I need.

"I regret it If I could go back, I would never have joined the fucking gifted program. 

My parents wanted to have a prodigy, so that’s why they entered me into the program. Yeah, they got a prodigy (arguably) but I got nothing more than cheated out of my childhood. 

When I entered that damn program, everything normal about me was wiped away and I never got it back. I just wanted to be a kid, I didn’t want this stupid label or a program that would “”help”” me.",0
"Do you guys believe giftedness = high IQ? I have all the traits of a gifted person. Was always called smart as a kid and undergrad wrecked me due to no studying habits.

"Do you have VSS? For those unaware of Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS):

> Visual snow (VS) is a form of visual hallucination that is characterized by the perception of small, bilateral, simultaneous, diffuse, mobile, asynchronous dots usually throughout the entire visual field, but it can be partial, and it is present in all conditions of illumination, even with the eyes closed.

https://eyewiki.aao.org/Visual_Snow#Disease_Entity

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow_syndrome

I am wondering how VSS is correlated to general neurodivergence and if it can exist without ASD, ADHD, OCD, etc. 

The only three people I know who have VSS life-long, including myself, score in the gifted range on IQ tests. Yet, we would be 2E with all of our ailments and problems. 

This is a really big stretch but— perhaps the presence of life-long VSS may be an indication of an undiscovered ND disorder that may be positively correlated to enhanced cognition due to increased connections and hyperactivity of neurons in the brain. The bridge between ASD/ADHD and giftedness? I am aware that correlation does not equal causation.

My friends and I with VSS since childhood were able to speak very early as a sign of giftedness, yet we would score slightly above the threshold on the RAADS-R, for example. I wish someone would do a proper study on this and life-long VSS.

"Can gifted people identify easier psychopaths or sociopaths? One thing that I read about giftedness was the capacity to ""read people"" better than most. In my case, because of my life, I have some difficulty trusting my ""reads"" from people sometimes, so would like to learn others' experiences in aspect to this ""ability"" relating to identifying these ""real life actors"". As a young, one of my thoughts was about having one of these two traits, and now that I learned to be gifted, one other thought is if a smart enough psychopath or a sociopath could fake being gifted?

"Academic burnout. I'm a MSc student and I am heavily involved in local research on machine learning and mathematical optimization. I experience burnout-like state which suspectedly originates from the fact that I frequently overshoot the amount of knowledge and skills needed in most disciplines I am being taught just by using prior residual knowledge from self-learning, and now nearly every lecture I attend feels boring, lectures are paying no attention to my attempts to really prepare to exams instead of relying on skill of outsmarting examiners (I am really skilled at this), negative response on my tryouts to engage in educational process (usually I am being told ""I know that you know the right answer, let others work""). And because of this I really started to become lax in my learning duties, lax enough to feel the negative impact on adsorption of provided knowledge but not enough to push my grades below A+. 
But when I'm doing my research, writing papers, writing code, and doing some calculations I feel alive again and can sometimes work 12 hours straight without noticing time passage.

"Hyper brain and visualizing Hey!   
Why is my brain so hyper-active all the time? This is something i've struggled with my whole life.  
For me it seems like a lot of people can just go into  ''airplane mode'' and relax whenever they want, this is not the case for me. I constantly have thoughts that are building upon other thoughts and suddenly i start to wonder and get curious about things i really have no reason to be curious about. -  I get comments from other people. ''No normal person just thinks about that for no reason'' / ''You think about things no others think about'' and so on. I am not trying to say i am in anyway sharper or a better thinker then other people (the hell would i know, i don't see myself as that bright anyway), but i start to wonder why i am wired this way and other people are not?

I am not saying that other people do not have thoughts flying around in their head, ofcourse they do, we all do. But in my case it seems like it is going in high speed all the time. In combination to go a high speed, i aslo visualize a lot, and that in great details. The combination of rapid thoughts and visulizing can be a lot sometimes, this also makes it hard for me to fall asleep.  - And for some reason, this makes me talk extremely fast, to the point some people have a hard time understanding me. And no, i am not nervous or anxious when i speak to unknown people, but the combinations of fast thought and visulizing makes me gain informations very fast it seems like. Since i've been young this have been a problem, especially with teachers. ''You talk very fast, something it sounds like you are swallowing your words''. 

For instance, when i talk to people and they for example say ''apple'' or ''banana'' i get a lot of rapid thoughts and clear detailed pictures of where i've heard, seen or smelt that before. Like constantly flashes in my head or scenarios. - And the pictures can just build upon each other, for example the apple part. A friend saya the word apple, and i get a picture in my head of applepie, then i would probally get a picture of american pie in and would somehow connect that with an embarrassing sex-action my friend had some years ago, and that within seconds. - We would probally have a good laugh, but still look at me a bit goofy of why i suddently started to think about that, and then i will explain my thoughtprocess, and he would still look at me a bit goofed out.

This is also a reason i have minor anxiety, i have anxiety for things i can not controll. Therefore i double check things. - Reason being, i can clearly remeber i did task A in clear details in my head, but then i can visulize that i did not do task A in same cleared details i remeber i did task A. So it is a constant battle with my own imagination, but in the lates years i've started to just trust my gut and think about it from a more logical perspective. - If that made sense.   


Is this normal, or why am i wired like this? - Seems like mom are somehow in the same terms as me, but her anxiety is much worse then mine and stems from the same reason as mine, and she does not talk as fast tho, but still at a good pace.",0

"Cresconova-Online Gifted Programming Hello gifted community!

I have worked with gifted learners for many years both nationally and internationally, recently working at The Nueva School (a Nationally acclaimed school for gifted learners) for 4 years. As I saw the clear need for gifted learners to receive the right kind of education, be surrounded by mentors and intellectual peers, I was also confronted with the reality of access.

Therefore, a former colleague of mine and I began [Cresconova](https://www.cresconova.org), an online enrichment program for gifted learners. Right now we are hoping to serve 6-8 year olds, but going to expand to other ages in early 2023. We have hired a number of master teachers who have worked with gifted students for many years.

We are offering classes during the day to serve homeschool learners, and afternoon programming to serve those looking for extensions. We are hoping to reach students globally as well, and have students signed up in Singapore and Australia. Please check out our [site](https://www.cresconova.org) and pass it along to anyone that you feel might be interested. Thank you!",0

"ADHD + high IQ Vs. gifted? Little bit of context: I myself have been misdiagnosed with dyslexia as a child. After two years of treatment, they retracted the diagnosis because I was certainly not dyslexic. It's clearly I have *something*, but for some reason they didn't procede further into finding out *what*. I and most people around me are pretty sure it's some form of AD(H)D or something similar.

A couple of years ago, my sibling's partner was double diagnosed, along with giftedness. Just like me (and later i found out, just like my sibling), it was obvious to them their whole live they were different, but they weren't diagnosed during childhood. Now their child is showing signs of being gifted themselves (to young for official testing), so me and a few others in the family have been reading books about giftedness in children and adults alike to prepare on how to handle it.

My sibling and I recognise a lot of aspects of giftedness in ourselves. We've been talking about it, and my sibling is sure we both are gifted (my sibling's partner is pretty sure of my sibling as well, they don't know me enough to be as certain about me, but still think it's a high possibility). One thing is certain though: I display a lot more aspects of concentration difficulties and hyperactiveness than my sibling, and my sibling scored a bit higher on an IQ-test performed when we were young (them low 14O, me middle to high 130). While it's pretty obvious my sibling has undiagnosed giftedness, I myself am not sure if I'm gifted or if I have ADHD with a higher IQ. I know having an IQ in the middle to high 130 range doesn't *necessarily* meen being gifted.

saying inappropriate things due to over-intensity. gifted or ASD?

at the end of the day all of these labels are just an attempt at explaining the human experience based on shared qualities. so im trying to accept that it's a flawed system to begin with, that serves its purposes...but that categorization may not solve the answers to my soul searching.

i can camera pan around objects in my head or through buildings or places and memories i have been before. 

See things from different perspectives also from other people with their experiences and how that reflects on my version of the thought always scanning my environment and getting inspiration how things work top down thinking, sometimes with my own dialogue or if my brain is in a weird vibe narrators or voices from other people multi langual. Sometimes its like i have my own radio playing in the background in my head and cant stop it.

I can hop from many different perspectives and more processes are going on at the same time where i am unconscious of sometimes.

I find it really hard to express my vision into words and language is really limiting for me.

"Need advise from gifted parents, my 3 y.o. has already mastered Piaget’s conservation tasks? My little was born a 24 week micropreemie so I wasn’t expecting them to be advanced developmentally, but it’s been obvious from the start that they’re bright. 

They were a super early talker with a vocabulary of single-words at 5 months (corrected age) and using sentences by 8 months (corrected age). I bought them lots of baby books they’d sit and stare at/pretend to “read” when they were 10-11 months old (at which point they already could identify all the letters in the alphabet but couldn’t actually sound out words). Soon they started pulling MY books off the shelves and tables to look at and “read.”

I have a lot of art books (ex. like a book of collected prints of Yayoi Kusama) they are particularly fond of and like to sit and “read” all the time. I realized they’re able to identify which paintings are by which artist off of the style alone (I’ve tested them using pictures I know they haven’t seen before and they can identify painters like Dali, Monet, Van Gogh, Gauguin, off of the style of the painting).

They just turned 3 this month and for fun I ran them through all of Piagets conservation tasks, they understood all of them as being the same. I did my best not to do anything that may prompt any particular response/neutral expressions/quiet environment, though obviously it’d be different having them actually tested in a formal environment I was just curious to see how they’d respond. 

All of this is to say, I feel so out of my league. They surprise me every day with what they know, say, do, and how they problem solve. I’m curious to hear all advise, especially from other parents of children who were showing similar signs at this age, what worked parenting-wise in helping their development. How can I keep up with them? What can I do to support their learning and keep their mind challenged on new things? Anything I should avoid doing?

"From Ashlee Vance biography of E.M. concerning profound giftedness Listened to this audiobook about 6 times all the way through in the past 2 months and keep coming back to these paragraphs (emphasis mine).   


""Musk's behavior matches up much more closely \[than Aspergers, discussed in prev paragraph\] with someone who is described by neuropsychologists as \*profoundly gifted\*. These are people who in childhood exhibit exceptional intellectual depth and max out IQ tests. It's not uncommon for these children to look out into the world and find flaws - glitches in the system - and \*construct logical paths in their minds to fix them\*. For Musk, the call to ensure that mankind is a multiplanetary species partly stems from a life richly influenced by science fiction and technology. Equally it's a moral imperative that dates back to his childhood. In some form this has forever been his mandate.

Each facet of Musk's life might be an attempt to soothe a type of \*existential depression\* that seems to gnaw at his every fiber. He seems man as self-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The people who suggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in the way of all of this and slowing Musk down. He does not dislike them as people. It's more that \*he feels pained by their mistakes\*, which have consigned man to peril that much longer. The perceived lack of emotion is a symptom of Musk sometimes feeling like he's the \*only one who really grasps the urgency of his mission\*. He's less sensitive and less tolerant than other people because the stakes are so high. Employees need to help solve the problems to the absolute best of their ability or they need to get out of the way....""

My first specific question - where do you meet gifted friends and partners in real life?

Also, I'm seeing some suggestions to have non-gifted friends who have specific interests. The problem I've had with this is simple boredom. Even for specific hobbies, it's very hard to find people who are intensely interested in them. Second specific question - how do you not get bored around people who take a less intense approach to your areas of interest?",0
"Something I wish I had known when I was younger - focus on the basics I posted a question, and I realized I'm always asking for advice and rarely offering any that isn't ad-hoc in another post, so here's something that would have saved me about ten years.

I'm about to be 33 now. I spent a lot of my life exploring a multitude of academic topics because I wanted to ""know everything I could."" I still do, but I realized now there's so much I don't have mastered that's extremely pragmatic.

People have a tendency to overestimate their ability in endeavors they partake in regularly. This is where all the benefit is. Instead of focusing on mathematics, music, programming, foreign languages, and all the other things that make you academically well-rounded (that aren't hobbies or career-related), focus on those most basic things - the science of happiness, mood management, your own psychology, the science of relationships, communication skills, etc.

Not only is this more useful, it's more rewarding by extension. You feel better when you use something to overcome a problem, and it's much easier to stay motivated.

Big caveat, don't just read about these things generally. Choose good sources. There's a lot of pseudoscience on these topics. Don't just google ""How to be happy;"" read the papers from the Harvard Study on Adult Development.

Oh, and take a slow, concentrated process toward learning these things. I know we have trouble being patient, but if you can't focus over an extended period of time, work on that first. I had untreated ADHD until I was 30, I think. I was in first gear most of my life and didn't know it.",0

"Giftedness and nicotine/cannabis Hope this is the right forum, I am not praising/recommending drugs/drugabuse!

[m24] So hi,

I‘m having a problem with said drugs when entertaining myself. 

To get to the point quickly: 
I feel like I got to a point in life where I cannot entertain myself other than making my head „numb“ to any sensation and reducing my need for difficult recreational activities to the bare minimum, for example watching shows, playing simple games or reading a „not too great“ book.

I am not sure if this is related to me being gifted, but as giftedness and drug consumption are significantly  correlated (James White, david Batty), I hope to find individuals who experience(d) the same fate and like to share advise or ask questions.



I smoked tobacco for around 3/4 years, then stopped last year only to fall into cannabis addiction right after. 
I havent been to addiction counseling yet, but will go this week as I want to get to work with my easily addicted self. 
I still have a pretty busy schedule, which also results in higher consumption to „get down“ in the evenings.

Thank you for your advise:)",0

"Task motivation Hi, like most gifted people (from what I read), I get interested in different topics with frequency, mainly as soon as I finish understanding the basis of my current interest topic. My problem is keeping the motivation to complete the current task/tasks when my mind is already thinking about the next steps (currently in a critical way, as I need to finish polishing an algorithm and writing my Ph.D. thesis, but all I can think of is the next ideas I have for new applications of what I learned and other possible ideas for different fields of interest, and by so I can't finish what I NEED TO DO right now).  


 So I would like to ask if someone has any suggestions on how to keep the motivation to do tasks that you already lost interest in that (like keep doing math problems when you already understood the topic).  
Thanks ahead!",0
"What’s the difference between above average intelligence and giftedness? how to distinguish them ? Sorry if this question’s already been asked! But I’ve been scouring the sub to find a discussion post about this topic and couldn’t find any that directly answered my question. I’m a bit familiar with the characteristics of “gifted” individuals already, but I wanted an idea as to how these traits compare to smart, but not gifted persons. 

I was in GATE in the third grade, never got the extensive amount of testing some gifted children seem to get though, so no IQ score to go off of. I’ve recently been looking into it, and brought it up with my talk therapist at the end of our last session. She said we could try testing through a community college maybe. I’m just kind of curious to know where I land. Some problems with my working memory/recall due to ADHD and struggles with executive function (improved since medication) definitely warps how I perceive my intelligence.",0

"I'm feeling like I'm not living up to my potential I'm a 17 year old guy in highschool who has been identified gifted by literally every teacher (well only anedcotically, I never took an IQ test but still). 

The expectations that were put onto me were extremely high, I started reading very early (like 3-4 years) and at a very young age i had lots of interests (that of course, somewhat distinguished me from my peers) like reading astronomy, cars, cartoons, brick building etc. In Kindergarten I was also talking about pretty ""advanced"" stuff and i was doing 2-3 grade math when I was 5. My giftedness was pretty much apparent when I started going to school. The first 8 grades were pretty easy, i got good exams scores and could go to the best highschool in my city. 

This is basically were my problems started to ramp up. You see, I never actually developed any study methods because I didn't need to study. But now, in my highschool the shiton of work demands a perfect work ethic from me. The first year was a tragedy for me and I ended with an above average GPA, but not really an ideal one. 

Although my habits are improving, I still think it's not enough, especially considering what a legacy i have to uphold. My mum was always an incredibly gifted student, she scored the 1st place on the math national exam and 2nd in physics. She was also the best in her medical school. She also has wrote few advanced philophical works, but he didn't finish her phd. This places an extremely high pressure on me to succeed at basically everything.

I just wanted to rant, because sometimes honestly it's hard to keep up with my own and others' standards.",0
"Narcissism and giftedness Unfortunately there is a big misconception between narcissism and giftedness. And many narcissists mistake themselves for being gifted and HSP. 

Most narcissistic people have a form of covert narcissism and empathic narcissism in combination with feeling very sensitive for themselves and because they create all these frameworks to use in day to day life can live therefor in a delusion it can make them think they are highly intelligent or gifted or different. This can also show in body dysphoria and personality issues.

They might feel strong empathy for others and have strong moral compass and show controlled compassion and think in ways to push this forward in every way possible might suffer from OCD kind of symptoms and dysphoria and therefor feel miss fits and have a hard time with adapting in society. 

They can even have depression and anxiety. Being busy with topics to feed their frameworks but is most of the time very subjective and biased. Because they use all this info to get something out of it for themselves they can be pretty educated on some topics but will show manipulation and aggressive behaviour in return when their bubble bursts. 

What is seen pretty often is that these narcissists find groups to feed each other and find compassion. most of the time it also drags real empathic people that wants to help them and other narcissists who support them.

There are “gifted” narcissists who might say that giftedness is something spiritual and connected to higher dimension’s, they also go in discussions a lot to prove themselves how smart they are and unique. And react with a lot of information in perfect grammar and punctuation that actually doesn’t say much to prove their point. 

They talk a lot in labels and self diagnoses and rare disorders, will fact check on everything and ask for scientific proof even if there might not be a study for it, while its just commons sense.

For sure there might be gifted people with narcissism but the opposite is more common.",0

"What would you have done as a gifted kid? Hello. Throwaway for privacy reasons. I'll delete this account after it accumulates all of the replies it can get.

I am a 14 year old 2e (OCD and Autism, both professionally diagnosed) ""gifted"" kid. I've never been officially tested with an IQ test but one is coming soon as per my school board's program. I like to keep to myself. I'm mainly self-learning Theoretical Computer Science (complexity theory) and the general field of CS, but I honestly don't know what to settle with as I am interested in a broad range of interests such as physics and the other hard sciences. I plan to self-learn other topics in the future. Academically, I can be described as a 80-90% student. I don't care much about my ""gifted"" or ""good kid"" label. I just want to be treated as a human with ""unusual"" interests for their age. 

Occasionally, I browse this sub as a lurker without an account. I have heard your stories about how the system failed you and the mental illness that develops in the wake of the perceived failure.

My question to you is if you were sitting here and you were reverted back to your age as a 9-20 year old, what would you done differently to prevent the burnout and feelings of worthlessness? Would you have stopped propping yourself off to unobtainable standards? Would you have/ have not taken the program that your school district provided for you? Would you have tried to learn college studying habits instead of being lazy?

I'm interested to hear your stories. I think that they will provide me significant insight about what makes you tick and it can help me avoid some of the pitfalls you fell into. Even if burnout is unavoidable it may still happen that your advice could help put a band-aid on the emotion affect it has on me when it does eventually happen.

Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day.",0
"What should we do for our top 0.1% kid? We have four kids. Our first two go to a local private school for the gifted. The school requires a standardized test for the 4.5 year old pre-kindergarten applicants (which is already a little ridiculous). Our first two scored pretty high (top 2% then top 1%). 

Our third just did the test this week. He took it younger than the other two (based on where his birthday falls in the year) but just destroyed the other two on his score. Doctor said he got to the hardest question on most of the categories and got the hardest questions right (which he said he has never seen in his professional life). I asked if it was luck - these are multiple choice after all, but he said he asked for his reasoning and it was correct. 

Anyway, his absolute scores were much higher than the other two and his age was younger. Result was “top 99.9-percentile” (and they don’t measure beyond that). 

(Maybe related? - he is also ridiculously physically gifted. He stared walking at 8 months - way earlier than his siblings. He can throw and catch and play frisbee like an adult (again - very unlike his older siblings) and he is so skilled on his scooter these days that we are often stopped by strangers who are shocked by how old he is. I have lost count of the number of strangers who approach me and ask me if he is going to play football.)

Default plan is for him to go to the same school as his sisters. There is a local lacross league that starts at the kindergarten level that I may try to get him into a year early. He is getting extra stimulation from his early sisters so he can do basic multiplication and division now. And he loves playing chess so we do that most days (he does not seem to be a genius here at all that I can tell. But he at least knows how to play the game and very basic strategy). 

Is there anything specific we should be doing or thinking about?

I know there are things like Center for talented youth at John Hopkins. But that seems to be for anyone in the top 2% and doesn’t start until 2nd grade. Anything we should be doing when he is still pre-K or over the next few years?

Thanks!

"Imaginative play in gifted children I assume gifted children have advanced play skills and engage in imaginative play sooner. My gifted daughter started pretending with dolls when she was around 18 months old. She’s almost 7 and I see her already moving away from imaginative play. She used to love playing Barbies with her friends. Her favorite playmates were a couple years older than her. She now prefers crafts, reading, board games and video games. Do gifted children stop engaging in imaginative play earlier than average? From what I’ve read average age children start losing interest in imaginative play is 9 to 10.",0
"Does a realistic example of a gifted person exist in popular media? I suspect people might misestimate the abilities of gifted people because few to no realistic examples exist. Everyone seems to be a prodigy and either has ASD or ASPD.

Sherlock Holmes in the BBC show is the only consulting detective in the world and is a ""high-functioning sociopath."" Sherlock Holmes in the movie understands patterns so well he can predict an entire fight and make a plan in a fraction of a second.

Dr. House can accurately diagnose a disease that's only been seen a few other times in history and is so confident he regularly risks his medical license.

Dual doctorate Sheldon Cooper is of course as theoretical physicist at a premier school with an IQ outside of the range most tests measure.

Dexter is of course a cartoon, so he doesn't really count, but to the extent he should be considered, he built a laboratory in his house at 8. I'm just going to throw Jimmy Neutron in here too.

Will Hunting becomes a mathematician based on a library education, and he's such a prodigy, a Fields Medal recipient takes him on, and he quickly embarrasses a faculty member at Harvard (or MIT?). He then makes it through therapy under another prodigy in, what, six months?

"My dad said something a while ago but it still sits on the back of my mind today Last academic year, I won an award for best grades/final report card in my year (10 out of 180 students got it). The school never released our scores publicly but I'm sure I got at least 3rd place as all my subjects were top marks except for one of them (I got 1 level below top). My dad didnt congratulate me much, instead he said (In my native lang.) ""I bet you're the worst/dumbest one up there. None of them waste as much time as you do on schoolwork"" 

I never noticed how much it affected me, but the more I think about it, the more I realise that it's always in the back of my mind whenever I do homework, assignments, tests etc.


Little disclaimer: I'm 99% sure I'm not supposed to be in this subreddit, as I've never won any competitions, never done any IQ tests, I scored way below average on the AMC 8 (American Maths Competition) and my processing speed is very slow.

"Is anyone here not particularly knowledgeable? I have always been told that I’m “brilliant” “very smart.” But I honestly feel pretty stupid on a daily basis.

I hate to admit it, but I barely have an understanding of politics, government, history, economics, and social issues. I didn’t and could not pay much attention in school. I always zoned out and did my own thing. 

I have always wanted to learn deeply about these things but I get overwhelmed with how much I don’t know, that it paralyzes me so I remain uninformed. Executive dysfunction doesn’t help, and I have also become increasingly apathetic over the years so that hasn’t helped, either. 

Every now and then I am able to get started and focus, and end up on a rabbit hole of research, where I research the *shit* out of the topic. But that is fleeting and rare. And even then I feel like I only I understand a tiny fraction of the issue and there’s so many angles I’m missing. 

When anyone brings up any of these topics, I feel embarrassed and hate myself because I am so ignorant that I can’t even hold an intelligent conversation about any of it. So I just listen to their point of view and stay silent, because whatever I say will probably just be contradicted or they’ll demolish any argument I form.

"Giftedness specialists/therapists in socal? I found this sub just now and I haven’t read too many posts so I’m not exactly sure how things work around here; but I’m approaching 20 and looking to get some recommendations on coaches/specialists/therapists that specialize in “giftedness” preferably in the Socal area. 

I don’t wanna go on a tangent about my story and whole life’s journey up to now because I know I’ll get off track, perhaps on a later post. But my experience has made me skeptical about being *truly* “gifted”.  I was in the GATE program in 3rd grade due to my teacher’s advocacy. She was the only one all throughout my school years who even considered the idea— I wasn’t enrolled into ever again. I’m mostly of the opinion that it was just a fluke from 11 years ago.

I also never got tested. I’ve gone down a recent rabbit hole about everything and brought up IQ testing to my regular talk therapist yesterday at the end of our session, though I know it’s not an all-the-way accurate measurement. She told me we could maybe try to get me tested through a community college.

I was late-diagnosed with ADHD at 16. My therapist was the one who first brought it up to me because she said I shared traits with her 26 yo son, who has ADHD and autism.

She’s been a help as well, but I do think I might want further insight from someone who works with gifted individuals often.",0
"giftedness and autism relation? one neuropsychologist said all my autistic symptoms are actually due to giftedness while a bunch of other professionals said i was autistic (but the one that said it was giftedness was the only one to apply the gold standard test for autism). that made me really confused, i don't know which one i am, or even both. it feels like something's not quite right.

before seeking a formal diagnosis i was pretty confident i had autism and ADHD (with high IQ that didn't really affected anything - tests were made by professionals).

is this confusion between these conditions common? what about you guys? are you also autistic/adhd or just gifted?

"Does anyone have a really solid way of describing how unrealistic their expectations for themselves got? I suspect I have a tendency to set my goals way too high, and I don't think I even know what's realistic for me anymore. Worse, it occurred to me earlier that people do in fact lie on the internet, and I might often be influenced to pick up the pace by fabricated stories. For instance, I saw a post earlier where a guy claimed to be making $320,000 at age 28. Now, this particular claim could be true, but about 5% of people supposedly have a pathological or compulsive lying problem. Most of the time I see these crazy claims, they probably aren't true. (That's just Bayes' Theorem in action.) Unfortunately, my brain doesn't think, ""Wait, only 1% of Americans of any age make that income."" Instead, my brain defaults to, ""I could be doing so much better. I really need to try harder."" I've also forgotten that I don't account for the conditions of my upbringing. I was born into poverty, and I often forget that about half of Americans grew up in households where their parents made $70,000 or more. I don't think about having had unmedicated ADHD until I was 30, and because most people I know are neurodivergent, I forget most people don't lack executive function in the same way. Despite all of this, I still expect myself to accomplish not only anything meaningful to others, but eventually I expect myself to be good at almost everything society deems meaningful that's even remotely within my grasp.

"underachiever, 2e, coping strategies Dear all, 

I am moderately gifted and suffer very severe mental issues. Due to them and some bad luck (also a lot of stigmatization because of my issues) I am one of the worst underachievers that I have ever heard about. Although I have to admit that sometimes there are short times in which I excel, so my performance is fluctuating a lot. 

Right now I am in a position where I have to do much stuff that I have learned some years ago in the past already and I am dying out of boredom. I restarted college and since some courses are somewhat differently in their topics or in their partitioning of the content I can't simply take the credit for the old ones in this program. 

I have no real strategies to cope with underchallenge. In school I didn't do anything and got through. My health improved once I got out of school (so I had no real strategy back then too). When I learn a lot I feel better, but right now there is no chance to learn (much) new stuff and I feel as if I was back in school, this nagging boredom is getting and eating me. I think it stresses me out on a different level. Sometimes I need a day or longer to recover from being bored out in a lesson. it ruins this very exciting subject for me somehow. Also, I struggle with my misconception that I have a really strong tendency to adapt to other people's expectations. It makes me depressive. But without this program I barely have any chance for a good job later. Idk what to do. Sorry for being whiny. 

Does anyone know any groups for gifted underachievers, 2es, knows strategies to cope with that (I am really grateful for anything since I am very dissociative and traumatized I think I just become numb and dissociate once I am in such an dissatisfying situation and have troubles getting out - this is what I have done mainly in school etc)?",0
"Biased teachers professors and studies Over the years i start to see a pattern in many different studies what was not happening before it’s like it all comes down to political manipulation or some “cultist” biases. Also people very much refer to these studies because it is science and “proven” meanwhile its wrong even peer studies which have connections with the other studie performers etc. 

Also scientists professors and teachers very much go on this bandwagon, i am glad there recently is a site where you can report biased professionals. 

What is very concerning is the misinformation that gets indoctrinated in our society if you can’t trust science and teachers than what can you trust? 

A university should be a place where you can discuss everything without a biased outcome. Meanwhile universities these days lean way much more toward one political opinion. 

another thing is people these days get labeled as professor meanwhile i dont think their title is worthy even if they did a lot of studies, what did they do in the main-time, eating out of their nose? And their behaviour is outrageous almost lunacy.

I’d feel this pull between being somewhere new and going back home to live a more “conventional” life. Whenever I was abroad it felt like there were more possibilities to meet interesting people and experience new places where things could be better for me. But at the same time I felt I was lacking in developing long term relationships and a sense of permanence and belonging.

Everything you just said i go through in different layers multiple times per day dont worry and its not really an issue… 

on one hand you can think these people just try to go on the wave i have been going on for years plus they themselves would probably struggle with it a lot and project it on me. 

But on the other the reaction i get is it makes me insecure at first but when so many people do this you almost start to adjust and believe it and just scratch my plans.  

Plus when you also go into discussion with these people it ruins the harmony and i just shut up because than it becomes some sort of ego game. 

But at the same time than they take the whole time to prove themselves why its not working for them and they are glad they dont do it. 

Nice thats how 99% of the people never really achieve something huge and stay in their comfort zone thats why it are my goals and dreams.

So, scrolling through some reels, I discovered this trend with music that is supposedly stimulating for neurodivergent people (the captions will often say something about ADHD or Autism, but sometimes they just say neurodivergent in general).

The tracks used usually belong to the categories of ""8D/spatial sound"", ""bilateral stimulation"" or are simply layered mash ups.

However, when searching for similar music, I'm kinda lost. 8D sounds are the easiest to find, but most of them are remixes of pop songs with much worse vocals, which isn't really my kind of music.

Searchich for bilateral stimulation, I mostly find meditative tracks, but I'd like something more upbeat.

Regarding mash ups, I'm sure there's a ton of good one's out there, but I don't really know where to start.

So I thought I'd ask here. What music do you find stimulating? Any ideas on where to search for similar tracks? Feel free to share your thoughts :)

I'm a college student, but for as long as I can remember, I've received less praise and recognition for my work and far fewer compliments in general than my peers, even when I've devoted significant time and energy to my work.

For example, classmates share their thoughts in class, and everyone else nods, saying, ""Great point,"" or, ""Yes! I agree."" But that doesn't happen when I share. Peers sometimes refer to something I previously said but won't give me credit, or they stay silent after I share or give a presentation. I get an icy vibe, and it doesn't help that I notice *everything* in social interactions, including feelings others try to hide.

But I don't remember the last time someone complimented me or said, ""Great work."" I'm a 4.0 student and get positive remarks from my professors, but my peers treat me differently for reasons I don't get. I'm not arrogant, I don't brag, and I compliment others when I mean it, so I see no valid reason for their behavior.

I know I shouldn't care about compliments, but all human beings need encouragement now and then. There's nothing wrong with admitting that, as long as we aren't too dependent on it. But for me, it's about the principle of it, and I can't shake the feeling some people are withholding compliments on purpose. I can't prove it, but I wonder. Does anyone relate?

"Who else is anti intellectual? I was typing a really long rant about how ""intelligence"" as a concept is pointless and misused and how I hate hearing people using the term ""intelligence""/""IQ"" to refer to things that it doesn't pertain, etc etc and I realized that I can't be bothered.

Whatever this thing called ""intelligence"" is, I want nothing to do with. I always known that I played dumb for convenience, I just never realize the extent to which I have been doing it. One of a byproduct of (at least my type of) intelligence is that I'm very good at reading the room and realizing where everyone else is at, and then learn to immediately pretend to be on exactly the same page with everyone else, whether they are right or wrong. That skill helps with amateur acting I found out, I just didn't realize how long I have been doing it.

I can think of so many things that can be described as intelligence, and none of them are related to each other, worse yet, no one even seems to even try to measure most of them.

The ""IQ"" people want to measure (IQ tests, SAT, GRE, MCAT, LSAT, etc.) is almost exclusively linear processing, and (almost) no thoughts been given to parallel processing (incidentally linear processing is almost useless in real life unless you're a computer programmer). No one seems to care about a measurement for anything more multidimensional e.g. sensory integration or even anything more straightforward (but more useful) e.g. short term tactile memory (I know it's under explored because I talked to a PhD program about that and those fuckers seem to think this idea, as straightforward as it is, is a good idea).

This gives rise to certain wishful narratives about the ""idiot savant"" or the ""autistic genius"", as though something has always have to give because ""you can't be smart and be normal"" or something, like a self fulfilling prophecy because people are hellbent in trying to paint the capacity of thought in the manner that only apply to linear processing, and people who are good at linear processing must then, for whatever reason, be bad at being human (being human is supposedly a byword for sensory and abstract integration in parallel processing, which, ironically, these humans couldn't find a word for).

Whatever my beef is with intelligence, it just makes me sick and tired and not want to be bothered with having a genuine conversation with anyone about anything. Simplified example, I want to go buy a fun sports car, people will start talking to me about horsepower. Am I gonna start asking them about the rev range where the power is? The ECU map? How much time can I actually spend in that power band? At sea level? Intake temp?

Or, rather, should I just patronize them and nod along? ""Intelligent"" is not a real thing (my believe, don't @ me), but if we were to use that term in a common vernacular sort of way (which is just about as accurate as the neuroscientists definition btw), it is no fun. I want to get a car and go vroom vroom, but if you ask, I'm gonna have all these questions in my mind, and I know none of these fuckers I'm talking to even thought about these questions unless they are into cars or engineering.

At any rate, just because I can think in nuance, who tf told anyone that I enjoy thinking and having conversations in nuance? People don't get things like torque curve or fuel mix or scrub radius or whatever (again, simplified analogy, I know most people understand those), but I just told them that I want to go into a car and go skrrrt skrrrt, how tf are they not getting *that*? 

I have just grown to be very good at playing dumb, and tbh I'd rather be known as dumb, or be actually dumb, because I just can't be bothered to share my idea with other people, or worse yet, having to explain shit to people. Just because I can ask and answer questions doesn't mean I enjoy asking and answering. Bitch don't kill my vibe.

If anything, playing dumb is the only way to make people confront with concept that they don't agree with. How many of y'all had the experience when the person you are talking to just absolved themselves from having to think through the topic you are talking about by trying to patronize you in telling you that you are ""smart""?

I hate having to indulge in convos, especially one where people pretend (or they genuinely believe? god I hope not) that ""achievement"" is related to ""career"" is in term related to ""intelligence"". Because 1. I see exactly that they are alluding to a caste system and 2. I'm not buying into it, and even if I were to buy into it, I will have 982937 metrics and definitions I need to sort out with them. And I don't even want to talk to them.

And I hate ""logic"" convos even more. Everyone and their dog knows what classic logic is and know how to do deductions and inductions, it is not cool or fun or meaningful to ""logic"" people. There is no logic in trying to perform logic deduction or whatever they call it, when there is no actionable decisions to be made at the end of it. I seriously don't understand society's obsession with ""logic"", where is the logic in performing deductions and inductions when you are not making an active choice? And what is the point of rerunning the same deduction twice? You make a calculation and you do it once, and you leave it as is. Don't fuck with the numbers. Seriously, why people say that ""I need time to think about it""? They obviously mean that they need time to get accustomed to and feel comfortable with their decisions so they need to regurgitate their calculations 808435 times to pacify themselves. Which is totally fine and normal, so just say it out loud in honesty. The dishonesty via performing logical deductions in illogical circumstances really trigger me. And god forbid, the people who define being ""logical"" as their identity might as well define dishonesty (specialized in self dishonesty) as their identity. (God I fucking hate Ben Shapiro and I want him to logicalize with my right uppercut. That lightweight can't do nothing right and somehow people watch him).

I spent my entire life (in my early 30s) playing dumb because I rather be blending in, functioning, enjoying my time then to drag every convo into a tangent. Whenever I see life advice about being ""smart"", or even people who talk about being ""smart"", or even thirsty pop up ads that seems to think that I (or indeed anyone) is gagging for validation in the form of a simplistic, overarching, and over-fucking-whelmingly wrong and pointless metric such as ""IQ"".

I mean, for the love of god, fucking kill me now.",0
"Gifted as an adult and problems with mental help organisations in the Netherlands Hello, 

long story short. I recently accepted that i am gifted after being in denial for years. the whole label doesn’t matter to me and IQ score. I need help how to deal with it i am 28 years old and im stuck in life, my whole life feels like a lie to me after so many jobs and failing at school and going from burnout to bore out i just feel like my flame is burning out.

Last time i asked for mental help again and opened up about giftedness and asked for help how to deal with this i went in another devastating psychology experience where i got misunderstood and the psychiatrist and psychologist didn’t know anything about the subject. I decided to follow their advice and their protocols but it didn’t help they even called me arrogant and unrealistic and challenged me to not believe in it. They worked with a new method that they dont focus on labels which i can partly understand but in this case it sounds like being so openminded that their brain fel out.

Eventually at the end of the process the psychiatrist said there is nothing wrong with me and i should accept that life is hard and you need to find your own way… lol, what an advice..

I had a discussion with her and she compared it to transgenderism and there she lost me completely. 

Eventually i went back to the doctor and she planned a meeting with some psychology adviser. 

That meeting also didn’t went well i had to prove myself constantly in the conversation we had and gave me vague assumptions that it might be PDD NOS or HSP which i debunked.

Eventually it seemed to trigger him and started to behave like he was more intelligent and told him he should be authentic and i understand he should do his protocol but that i did years of research myself and i dont want to be better than anyone else and idc if i am gifted at al and just need help with my problems. 

Eventually he started to sense that i think completely different and actually has no idea if there is anything he could do for me.

This whole experience is eating me inside i feel like an alien that is stuck. Even feel that i might be delusional. And try to challenge my own thoughts till the whole name “giftedness” turns my stomach.

Im even thinking to try to solve it myself but i need someone to challenge my mind from an outside perspective.

Are there any people who experienced the same and has any advice or tips?

much appreciated",0

"""You're perfect"" No, I am not.

Yes, it is true I am smarter than most people in most areas of knowledge, both academic and street-wise. You're totally right when you say I get things a lot faster than ""normal"" people. In fact, I can read lots of things, like the room, an 1889 novel in a foreign language, those school books you paid for but never read, local and foreign newspapers and even body language!

We can talk for hours about football, in spite of the fact that I seldom find joy in watching a match. Or we could perhaps discuss the intricacies of alluring the opposite sex, between ""bros"". How about the dynamics of college parties where everyone gets wasted? And all those girls after me? They are cute, and I won't deny I find their attention entertaining, but they are, in my eyes, a waste of time to be with.

On a regular basis, people from all walks of life, degrees of education and familiarity tell me I am ""brilliant"", ""cool to be around"", ""off to a great life"", simply ""perfect"". And yet, I feel like my truth doesn't live up to everyone's expectations. I have a bad relationship with my family, most of my 'friends' are fake and completely untrustworthy and people ask but never give. There is no person I can truly trust with my true self. All I ever show the world is a mask consisting of delusions of grandeur, extroversion, passion for things I couldn't give a dime about, never making any mistakes and just being the ""perfect"" guy.

I feel like a farce. I may be surrounded by people all day long, but I bet I am the loneliest of them all. Don't worry though, I'll be fine, because that's how I've always been and how I'll always be.

All these things are just kids being taught to perform tricks for the sake of their parents' bragging rights. It does nothing to help the kids themselves.

"To put a 7yr old with older kids or not? My son is 7. So far we've been trying to keep him a little kid - stay with kids his age and not feel the pressure of the workload of older kids. Currently, we are fighting the school to accommodate his abilities and needs because he's growing unhappy. I'm really scared they'll want to put him with older kids.  

Can you please share your thoughts or stories? I kinda want him to be like Matilda and get to work on his own, but stay with kids his own age. I don't know what I really think is best. 

More details below

The school hasn't noticed he's PG due to physical limitations and he's growing unhappy with having to write and read too much, but at the same time the content is too easy. He's been able to do due more than his peers for years, but with the pandemic everything was virtual for years. He did one semester of first grade in person and we just wanted him to have fun with friends and get use to real school. That teacher did some work with him on the side, just because she was sweet and attentive, but she never realized how far she could have pushed him. This year's teacher just thinks he's keeping up because of the physical challenges. Tuesday we are taking our professionals to meet with the school. 

We are living in South America currently and in a small private school. There aren't gifted programs in any of the schools.

"Lightbulb moment - we, as parents, were getting it so wrong. 
I posted on Monday about my son’s (9) new diagnosis of dysgraphia & being gifted (98th percentile).  

Since then, our household has become the most calm I think it has been in years! 
Previously, everything was a battle.  It felt like he was pushing back or arguing for every single thing.  This led to frustration on our part and then the inevitable arguments, crying, shouting & upset.  A terrible cycle on repeat.  

Well, all week we’ve made a massive conscious effort to appeal to his intellect and rational side.  One simple example, every second evening it’s his turn to empty the dishwasher.  Normally a major trigger for arguments, but in the interest of fairness between him and our daughter (11), we always insist he does it.  This week I’ve been saying things like  “I need the dishwasher emptied.  I’m about to start preparing dinner and there are some utensils in there I need”.  Or “do you think it would be easier to get the job done before dinner, so it will be empty and we can put our dirty dishes in after we eat?”   I can see him pause, consider, then say “That makes sense, I’ll do it now”.   

I said to my son this morning how amazing it is that since we met the ed. psychologist on Monday there’s been no arguments or upset all week.  He said “But Mom, I haven’t changed at all, it’s because you and Dad now understand”.  I honestly don’t know whether to laugh or cry.  I feel so sad and angry that our eyes weren’t opened sooner.  That we could have been parenting him so much better if only we had realised.  

We had a chat.  I said I was so sorry that I had not been understanding him all this time.  He said to me “sometimes your door to understanding gets stuck Mom” and I just thought, WOW! How incredibly perceptive he is.  How emotionally intelligent! And how forgiving he is of us.  I honestly am just bursting with pride and love for him.",0
"My awareness paralyses me How do you live while being constantly aware of the meaninglessness of life? 

How can you perform any tasks at all if there’s no point in doing anything?

How can you put effort into anything that doesn’t give you immediate enjoyment?

How do you work to build a stable and happy future for you if all the work will inevitably end in death and absence?

How do you take yourself seriously when ‘you’ is nothing but a bag of organs and liquids that somehow ended up gaining a conscience and calling itself “I”? 

The conflict between my awareness and my ego is paralysing me, I am unable to live, love, study, develop friendships, etc. It’s two parts of me that just can’t coexist.

EDIT: this post has been heavily misinterpreted. I’m not depressed and I’m widely familiar with positive nihilism, existentialism, absurdism and so on. The point of my questions was to have a direct answer to them, I was really interested in knowing what you think of life and our place in the world, but this apparently came across as a request for help. Maybe it was the “conclusion” that made people believe I was spiralling into an abyss of mental illness, and that’s definitely on me for being unclear, but again all I wanted was to learn your ideas about the conflict between ego and totality, that characterises the human species because of its developed awareness. Maybe I asked these questions in a seemingly ‘desperate’ way because I was in a moment of crisis due to this problem. Anyway, that is why I didn’t reply to all the comments, but thank you for trying and sorry.",0

"Work ethic isn't that useful As much as a solid work ethic is sought after in this subreddit, it's not actually as useful as it's described to be. In fact, as someone who has had to rely on hard work, I find that kind of talk greatly upsetting. Perhaps you have not had to rely on work ethic, but that means you are not aware of how fortunate you have been. Work ethic without intelligence has ruined my life.

Let's put it this way: intelligence is like a car and work ethic is like walking. Based on the narratives I see on this subreddit, it doesn't matter if you get to the same place. If you walk to work, maybe it'll take more time and energy than if you drive, but you'll still end up at work. But what about the trip home? What about the walk the next day? What about groceries? And forget about any road trips across the country, there are certain goals that can't be achieved through work ethic alone. The fact is that life isn't about achieving one specific goal, it's about many, life itself is a big series of tasks and the process of accomplishing them, and so speed ends up mattering a lot more than position. And sure, you may develop a very good work ethic, analogous to strong legs. But even Usain Bolt cannot walk everywhere. He has no hope against the average car. And let me tell you as someone who has had to walk everywhere: hard work gets no easier for people who have to rely on it. I know it feels hard to you but you need to recognize that it is just as hard for us. We put in the effort often because we don't have the blessing of high aptitude, but don't mistake that for finding effort easy.

Maybe your problem is that driving takes a certain input of effort/walking too. You do need a baseline level of effort. After all, you need to walk to your car, which is tough if you never had to learn to walk. Even Einstein couldn't do anything if he slept all day. But this can be changed, you can develop a work ethic. No matter how hard I try or how much I want one, I can never get a car. We get a brain at birth and we are stuck with it. I won't comment on how easy developing a work ethic is (although almost the entire human population has done it), but it is certainly easier than ""impossible.""

I have had to watch people effortlessly accomplish what I couldn't in hundreds of hours of effort. I have sacrificed a lot just to keep up and have no hope of ever doing great things. All this just to see the people who don't share this struggle complain because of a glorified idea of hard work. It's not so easy. I have been largely useless and have accomplished very little, not because of a lack of drive or ambition or dedication, but because of a simple difference in aptitude. The ""lazy but smart"" people are miles past me despite having to expend no effort. It is so frustrating to see people on this subreddit act like giftedness is something bad.

And a lot of good ""earning my success"" has done me. I'm not sure you understand how little consolation the moral idea of having ""earned one's success"" is when you just can't accomplish anything. When you're at the end of a two hour walk to the grocery store just to get food and are now faced with the long walk home, you're not thinking about whether you ""earned"" the food you ended up with. What good is ""deserving your successes"" if you never experience them? As smart as you guys are, as easily as you understand things, you sure seem to have a lot of trouble understanding this.",0

"The College Admissions Process Does Not Work for Gifted People I've been a lurker on this sub for some time, and made a throwaway account to make this post. As for my background, I am a gifted 10th grader (IQ 135-140) who currently goes to a gifted grades 6-12 school.

I will start by outlining the issues with some deeper issues with our education system.

**TL;DR** Is it better to be the miserable big fish in a small pond, or the big fish with other big fish who can never find enough food to eat?

&#x200B;

**Grading is a silly idea**

I do not understand the school system's obsession with getting good grades. Even though in a career it is more important to be good at a few things rather than decent at everything, the school system rewards the latter. To be a ""good student"" one must get straight As in every class, which encourages breadth rather than depth of learning. Someone who dedicates all of their time to math is more likely to discover something great than someone who spends 2 hours a day doing math, 2 hours doing reading, etc. Even in college where you are allowed to focus in more on a specific topic, the first two years are taken up by general education, which is not all that different from middle and high school.

&#x200B;

**Tests that are required for admission are stupid**

AP tests tend to reward memorization and speed, and some to a degree where getting a good score is not about your mastery of the subject, but how much you study. For example, AP Literature requires students to write three essays in two hours, giving a student and average of 40 minutes per essay. Being able to write an essay in 40 minutes is not a useful school in college, nor in real life, which makes getting a good score on that exam more about how much a student practiced writing essays quickly rather than a test of the student's ability to comprehend literature. 

It seems silly to spend so much time studying something useless, when one could instead spend that time on learning something more useful to real life. In general, standardized tests promote this kind of ""fake learning,"" due to their rigidity and the relatively short timeframe that they are administered in. 

&#x200B;

However, let's say that we *need* standardized tests and grades to participate in society. Still, us gifted people can never win.

&#x200B;

**Gifted students are punished for challenging themselves**

When I was in elementary school, I went to a fairly normal private school. Many of you can identify with the experiences that I faced there. I was constantly bored in class, and no matter how many times I asked for acceleration, the school would never give me the true intellectual stimulation I desired. I am not going to go into too much detail here because I think most of us understand the issues at normal schools.

In middle school, I was finally able to go to a (private) gifted 6-12 school. At first, there was an adjustment period at the new school, since the workload finally challenged me. I had to actually study for tests and spend a significant amount of time doing homework. However after the adjustment period, life was great! I would say that overall, I was fairly happy in middle school. (Except 8th grade was online for the whole year which sucked)

Fast forward to high school, and I am now realizing the flaws with the college admissions process. As a gifted student, my parents and friends expect me to get into an Ivy League school, and I know that I would feel inadequate if I do not get in. Unfortunately, the college admissions process penalizes students who want to take challenging classes and learn things by expecting perfection on every application. Since my school is for gifted students, and consequently more difficult, it makes it more difficult to get straight As, even though many students at my school would have easily gotten straight As at a traditional high school

Colleges also have quotas on how many students they can accept from a certain school, which disproportionately affects my school. Many of our 12th graders deserve to get into these colleges, yet cannot because of the quotas; they can only accept a few people from my school, even though everyone would be the ""top student"" at any other school. Moreover, the matriculation at my school generally ends up not being better than other schools in the area, even though the quality and rigor of education is far higher. 

The point is this: It seems like gifted students have to make a tradeoff in their education. They can either challenge themselves and potentially get bad grades, which lowers their chance of Ivy League admission, or they can be bored to death in easier classes, but have an easier time getting accepted into college.

1.I'm currently studying math and computer science parallel to school (on a bachelor level) and I don't regard it as difficult in any sense. While other struggle for days, I solve everything in minutes.

2.Basically any competition I enter I get to the 0.1%.

"Gifted people and the searching for problem partners I recently started reading material that made me think a little about relationships.

At first I thought it would be normal for these people to seek similar companies. However, I realized that it is more common for these people to seek partners who have social problems, neurological disorders and others.

More specifically i think that they need to have  someone needing their knowledge. A search for balance, not a search for equals or a search for a love that loves back, they need someone who needs them.

Although in the end love may end up emerging through coexistence, I still have doubts. Would this relationship be durable? What if one side becomes independent of the other and that balance is broken?

The tests on Brainlabs are designed in such a way that you have to practice to get better in some tests, until you reach your personal cognitive limit, which is different for everyone, depending on their intelligence profile. So you can also look and quantify how you are functioning that day. 

The site requires you to register, but you don't have to provide any real data when registering, so you can make up a fictitious email and password (Don't forget it :p).

What do I hope from this? 

To prove that every human being, depending on his intelligence profile, has a different maximum potential, which cannot be exceeded. Also, because the tests must be done multiple times, it is suited for people who have test anxiety, Aspergers and ADHD, because those profiles tend to have significant fluctuations in their cognition. 

Furthermore I hope to prove that these tests have a good reliability and validity to keep up with tests like WAIS IV and Stanford Binet. Also, i think this kind of testing can be a lot more valid, since momentary capturing of ones cognition can be fatal, aince some people can't perform to their potential. I can relate. 
(Brainlabs already conducted a Reliability/Validity Study, which show's a correlation of .67+ to g) 

I recommend the following tests: 

Feature Match: Information processing speed 

Spatial Span: Visual-Spatial Working Memory

Digit Span: Auditory Working Memory/Short-term Memory

Monkeyladder: Visual-spatial working memory

Double-Trouble: Inhibition Control

Odd One Out: Logical Reasoning

Rotations: Spatial Perception 

Don't get discouraged about your first results on the test;
You need to take each test probably 10-20+ times. After about 20 tries, I need your first score, your average score and your highest score, on each test listed above. You can do the Tests whenever you feel like it :). 

Also, I need your Device name (iPhone 13 Pro, iPad Pro 11 (2020), etc. 
This information is needed for latency reasons, since every device has a different Screen Refresh Rate, as well as screen sampling rate. 

I already collected scores from 43 individuals, with varying IQ's/cognitive profiles. Scores show very high correlation between my Theory, hwich doesn't suprise me that much, since higher intelligence is quantifiable. 

Have fun, and give your absolute best on each try! 

Note: Scores which seem to be cheated will (I had some people sending me scores our beloved Inspect Element), will be reviewed separately, to ensure credibility.

"Need for stimulation Hey =)!

I have a problem I am trying to solve, but i quite can't seem to figure it out.I have a problem with craving stimulation, and i've never been diagnosed with ADHD or ADD, I have talked about it with my doctor, but i didn't show any huge signs of ADHD/ADD, rather my craving came from bordom - The problem; i start to daydream, fidget, talk excessively or play on humor to get myself stimulated if find the tasks/situations i do mundane. This also seem to follow me in my everyday life, as i procrastinate a lot.   
But on the on the other hand; i can sit hours upon hours to solve problems i find challinging or do things/situations I actually find stimulating.Here is the confusing part, to some extent it seems like i have a short attention span on a lot of things. For example when people talk i can automaticly reply or ''be in the moment'' within the convorsation,  while i am on a other planet in my head. - That is the part i don't really get, why do i seem to have a hard time focusing on certain things, but i can sit upon hours and hours working or doing something i find fun? Like a automatic switch that i don't controll.  - I also listen to a lot of music, not for the sake of lyrics, but for the sake of stimulation.

"Gifted & Dysgraphia; newly diagnosed child So glad to find this sub. My 9 year old son had an Educational Psychological Assessment today and it is such an overwhelming relief for us - and most especially for him - to finally get to this point.  I don’t mean it’s great to have a “diagnosis” or a “label”, but to have a reason and an understanding of who he is and what helps make him who he is. 

He is gifted, in the 98th percentile & also has dysgraphia.  I’ll admit I didn’t know much at all about dysgraphia and assumed he might be dyslexic. However, he reads well above his chronological age but has huge problems  with spelling and handwriting.

"Would it really be worth getting tested as an adult? I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to post this, but I just want to talk about this and get some feedback/advice.

For context, I'm (24) physically disabled, (spastic quadriplegia and vision problems+ some less relevant physical disabilities.) Due to that and a lifetime of trauma, including abuse and neglect I was not really given a fair chance in school. I missed several years of formal education and often didn't have my disability accommodated when I did have access to schooling. I basically taught myself and still graduated as a member of the national Honor society in high school. However I grew up thinking I'm stupid and incompetent and I still feel that way now. I also live with documented CPTSD.

After getting myself out of my last bad situation and finally seeking therapy, I've had some mental health professionals suggest I'm highly gifted. I've been thinking about getting myself tested so that I can have some closure and ""know for sure"" because I've never had an IQ test.

However I'm worried, would they even be able to get an accurate score for me with my disability? (Like would I be able to have things adapted or have accommodations?) Are there any benefits to getting tested as an adult? What if I'm just full of myself for wanting this? The only things I can really see myself getting out of this would be closure, and maybe some social opportunities. I doubt it would be that high, but if it was, I'd probably join Mensa or something similar for social opportunities.

I'm happy to expand on anything if necessary. Any feedback or advice would be super helpful.

"DAE struggles with self doubt about their cognitive abilities? Hey, 

Recently I noticed a behavioral pattern that I’m displaying since my childhood: when confronted with any kind of assignment, that requires logical thinking, usually I figure it out really quickly, but I never trust my first solution to be the correct one, so I overthink it and come up with many alternative solutions, that are mostly waaaaay too complicated, just to find out, that the first one was correct after all…but even though I’ve had the experience so many times by now, I still don’t have the confidence in my cognitive abilities and do always struggle with self doubt and lack of self esteem.

Either they already have a boyfriend/girlfriend, are not gay/straight, it is a one-way street or it would become heavily complicated and had to stop myself. I dont know what is going on, it seems as if my love-life luck level has jumped into a damn ravine.

And its not like i am not at all goodlooking or anything like that either, in fact i have been complimented about it before, so wtf is going on?? Why cant i seem to be able to form connections even though i am attracted to people??

I dont know if its the adhd making me hyperactive and unlikable, or if being gifted is making me less likely to find a suitable partner, or if i am somehow scared of having someone emotionally close to me due to potential fallout when shit goes sideways (even though i have barely any experience), or if its just plain old bad luck so far.

It feels like my potential partner pool is just so damn small that i almost believe it to be unlikely that ill ever find a satisfying relationship to settle down with. I dont know what the hell i should do at this point.

"2e assessment/diagnosis - how did it go for you? Hey everyone - I’m learning more about myself every day and think I could be more than gifted - potentially also ADHD and/or ASD.

I’m 30M and have only started to tune into my thoughts and feelings, reflecting on my experiences as a child and, later on as an adult.

As there appears to be overlap between giftedness (which is the only constant/certainty in this for me), how can you differentiate between the traits exhibited by ADHD/ASD and giftedness? I appreciate this is the role of a professional, but if they don’t recognise/understand giftedness (and only diagnose ADHD/ASD in non-gifted), could this not result in a misdiagnosis? I’ve also thought that the AQ10 and the like may not offer a ‘true’ score in a gifted test taker, as they may have masked most of their life/their higher IQ counteracts the typical traits.

Can anyone offer their thoughts and experiences on this? The more I read, the more confusing it gets. I ideally want to speak to a professional who just ‘gets it’, rather than going around the houses (and paying a lot for it) to arrive at a misdiagnosis from a professional who cannot see the WHOLE picture.

"Can we save the world? I've been watching too many Kurzgesagt videos lately and giving myself existential crises. There seem to be far too many complex, wide-sweeping problems such that we cannot solve them in the self-constraining time limits provided to us.

My idea is that we map the connectome and then build a physical re-representation of the brain that can function as a quantum computer. This artificial brain would likely take up about a square mile since we need to be able to practically manipulate the realistically-sized subcomponents (equivalent to neurons) and perhaps if it becomes conscious, add additional networks through common semse alterations that could improve memory, abstract reasoning and creative consciousness at a level that allows us to access ""neuroconstruction"" technologies which can benefit our own brains based off of the empirical observations made in the Sourcebrain. 

So we could essentially hardwire our own minds into a new neuro-substrate using the advice of a greater intelligence than our own, which we created by ""playing around"" with cognitive neurology until we got it right. Then we could construct additional sensory and motor systems that allow us to create a distributed network across the planet which can monitor world-ending problems at the source by having a LARGE and HYPERCONSCIOUS system-being provide for all of our wants and needs via advanced problem-solving and essentially alien technologies that are needed to stop this (these) disasters as they come before it all ends, before each and every one of us turns to inert dust, first preceded by a long period of pain and unbearable suffering.

Who is maybe for Neuroinanimate Godhood? A planet of innovation, love, safety and protection of our personal resources, natural beauty of our ecosystem and the potentially massive, magnificent future of humanity, which must inevitably be an undertaking by hyperintelligent beings?

"Female giftedness and gender roles Hi, gifted girls. I'm aware this question can seems a bit silly, but I'm very curious about the answers you could give me.

Since I read time ago that we gifted people don't fit inside traditional gender roles (neither we're interested in trying), I've been wondering how do we perceive/describe ourselves.
Some psychologists classify us like ""psychologically androginous"" (and they also state we look younger than we really are. Fun fact).

"Those who are 2e/Twice Exceptional with autism/ASD - please can you share your experiences?

I’ve tuned in to this more recently (I’m a 30 year-old male in case this helps) and I’ve started to realise that this may explain it all.

I’m going to try and get an assessment ASAP, but I would love to hear your experiences to see if anything rings true.

School - very quiet, reserved, creative, small number of friends. Bullied at primary school but was far worse at secondary. Hyper alert. Profuse sweating. Fight or flight feeling all of the time. Struggled to interact with others (very low self esteem, especially girls). Very analytical and observant. A strong desire to have my own business at an early age.

Home - many interests, I tend to explore them intensely, love learning and sharing knowledge with others. Like my own space, not very ‘touchy feeley’. Don’t tend to initiate romantic behaviour with partner (I will normally wait).

Work - Fight or flight, hate repetitive tasks, get annoyed/frustrated with managers who pretend they know about stuff when they are wrong, but I tend to play dumb to keep relations happy (I hate confrontation). Hate being put in a box/job role when I have much more to give. Get bored easily and need novelty/complexity. A strong desire to be self-employed/do my own thing/always doing side hustles. Incredibly detail-oriented with intense focus. Perfectionistic.

Social - Hate social events, like making people laugh, don’t like going places by myself/agoraphobic, hate being centre of attention/spotlight syndrome, hate small talk. Don’t like going out with big groups (one friend is fine!). I think I make strong friendships via specialist interests. Very reserved and quiet. Hyper observant - like I’m a secret agent and can pick up stuff others don’t and view things in third person. Very good at reading others.

"Social interactions are draining me. What should I do? Social interactions, and on the overall the amount of social and sensory informations my brain processes and over-analyzes, are draining me. Today I reached a point at my internship where I just locked myself in the bathroom and forced myself to cry because it was the only way I found to evacuate this overwhelming.

As far as I remember I always had this shyness and this feeling of being different/apart of this world.

This is really causing me difficulties whith connecting with others and maintaining deep relationships. I'm starting to feel pretty lonely because I am pushing a lot of (good) people away and claiming my independancy (I don't need anyone and I don't need anyone validation). 

But at the same time I invested myself in a lot of activities where social contact is required because I thought it would help me feel less socially awkward (and it's actually not the case).

Every time I interact socially with someone at my internship I want to bang my head against a wall.

"Constant feeling of pressure Recently, I have constantly felt pressure in many ways. Like I feel pressure to start a business worth millions or become an important worker in a huge company known all around the world. I have this feeling that by becoming just a regular worker, I will waste all my potential. At the same time, I also feel like I am somehow expected to achieve something big because of being gifted (by society etc.). Now I already have some big academic and intellectual achievements (too many to mention here) but I feel like a vast majority of people wouldn't care about them and would find them worthless since they aren't ""the real world"" (you know how they say that grades don't actually matter if the person does nothing useful in the real world?). I already don't really get validation from the people around me (like nobody seems to actually find these achievements worthy, nearly nobody comes and asks for help, very few people acknowledge the achievements, etc). And from those who are actually supportive I mostly ever hear ""you are so smart so you will for sure do something huge for the world"". Now I know that these people are just trying to lift me up, but for me it is ""either you do something huge for the world or you will not get any validation or appreciation like right now"". As I earlier said, it also feels that if I don't do something huge, I will just waste my whole potential. It also think it is too late for me to think about this type of things. I am 20 soon and I would have to start from complete zero, I did not even have any real hobbies when I was younger.

So in conclusion, I constantly feel pressure to do something big, because otherwise I'd waste my potential, I'd get no validation, and because my current school achievements don't seem as worthy as I previously thought :( I don't want to be that one person who everyone sees as ""the one who wasted all their potential"" or ""the one who isn't even able to do anything useful in the real world outside of school"". And others saying ""you never know what might happen"" doesn't help me much either, because what if the scenario is that nothing ever happens at all? How does one get rid of that feeling of pressure, and what can I do to not waste my potential despite not doing anything ""big""?",0

"Our first grader is bored and getting in trouble... Per the title, our child is already having a rocky time at school...for me, it all started in 5th grade, so I thought we had some time lol. 

We strongly suspect he is gifted (probably mildly)...he is reading at least 2 grade levels ahead, and with math, he's ahead at least one grade level. Absolutely loves learning, reads sometimes multiple chapter books a day, does math at home for fun, and has so much energy. Yet we've been getting calls about his disruptive behavior. 

His teacher seems to not grasp giftedness much, other than saying that she notices that if he's not stimulated, he acts out. So the teacher is trying to differentiate, but I think her efforts are very limited. I've asked, but don't get much of an answer. She's totally overwhelmed, as she has 17 boys out of 24 kids.

Should I worry? At one point, our son was saying he felt like a bad boy because he couldn't control himself, and he says he is bored a lot. The teacher does have to have him sit away from others sometimes because he's distracting kids who are still learning to read, etc.

We've looked into a couple of options for next year, but he doesn't want to switch schools, probably because of his friends. He says he likes school these days. I'm a former teacher, so it's all hard for me to watch, as I want him to be challenged and avoid being stigmatized because of his behavior. I also don't want him distracting kids who need the education or making his teacher's job hard. 

I homeschooled him for 1.5 years during Covid and so I know his capabilities. And I love seeing him thrive. Sometimes I really want to homeschool, but I think I would go crazy. I need the stimulation of my career.

He is our only, so I also know I have a tendency to obsess over him lol.

Would the later grades be when it's more pressing to be sure he's getting challenging content, or should I act now?

"Do you find Growth in Strict Linear Thinking or Loose Thinking? The question may sound a bit off but it is a sort of quest / wonder and a dilemma i'm facing.

My dilemma is whether I should struggle and adopt/ revert to a linear thinking or shall I respect my natural instinct to let my thoughts wander. This natural instinct can be translated into excitability as reward of thinking that way. While linear thinking gives me the impression almost of fear of missing out.

"Trouble with pediatric therapist Hi there!

We've been having a challenge finding a therapist that ""gets"" our 12-year-old son. He's gifted, tested in the 99th percentile when he was 8, has ADHD, and was just diagnosed with high-functioning autism (née Asperger's) after a full neuro-psych eval which puts him firmly into the ""twice exceptional"" category. 

Forgive me in advance, I can be pretty verbose.

We're on his fourth therapist now, and we're having a difficult time figuring out if this guy is the right fit. He's experienced; he's a PhD and probably been doing this as long as I've been alive. He does IQ testing. We just feel he might not really understand the 2e aspect of our son. There are some specific examples I can get into that make us wonder if he's really listening to what we're saying and if he really ""gets it,"" but I'll try to keep to the main concern to keep this as brief as possible.

I've gotten a bit ""bristly"" with some of PhD's thoughts and advice. I am trying VERY hard to be really objective and mindful of my own insecurities and codependence, so I can usually calm down and understand what he's trying to say after a while, but we clashed a bit over something in this last appointment that has me reaching out to the gifted community to see if there are any insights into this.

My son is very much a logician. I am, too. He's very prone to many of the emotional outbursts that can come from a 2e male, but when he's mostly emotionally level he's extremely logical. When he's upset (not explosive like he gets sometimes), he and I can get into a logical debate about why he's upset, why things are the way they are, and what he can do about it. He usually walks away from those conversations feeling better, makes better follow-up choices, and shows appreciation for the discussion. These discussions are often the result of him clashing with my wife, who is certainly more emotional than logical, which causes a rift between them and their communication.

PhD says that such discussions between him and I aren't really beneficial, and can actually ""cause"" things like oppositional defiant disorder.

The explanation is that, if my son is upset and he doesn't get that logical explanation from whomever he's upset with, he can fight back and get defiant because he's come to expect a logical reason for whatever is going on. Further, PhD says that we are the parents, and sometimes our son just needs to understand that we know better and he just needs to comply. If my son wants to understand galaxies, why cold-blooded reptiles need to sunbathe, or get into an existential debate about why we're here on this Earth, we can have a discussion like that. But if it's about obedience or compliance, a simple explanation should do in most circumstances, or sometimes we just need to put our foot down and say ""because I said so.""

During this session, my son kept saying things like ""But those discussions really help me. They help me calm down and understand."" That broke my heart because I feel that's true.

Now I know I'm the parent of my son, and I know him much better after 12 years of life together with him, versus the one-hour-a-week PhD has gotten over the past few months, but I'm not sure whether to capitulate here, or keep doing what we're doing because I feel it's the better approach. Or maybe there's something in the middle? I'm just confused and frustrated because of the dichotomy between an expert's opinion, and my parental intuition. I get what he's saying; it makes sense that if my son comes to expect a logical explanation for everything that he's going to be disappointed in life because things aren't always so cut-and-dry.

So, to get to my questions:

1. Has anyone had a similar experience with a logician child that appreciates and seems to get value from a respectful debate when they're struggling with understanding something at home? How has that worked for you? Do you feel it's better to explain or to just dictate (for lack of a better word)?

2. Are there any opinions on whether or not the therapist is understanding of the 2e aspect? I know I didn't give many examples so this might be difficult to answer, so maybe I can make a follow-up post that's more specific about this therapist and the struggles we've had with him and others in general? I'm open to opinions and suggestions here.

Thanks for letting me vent and for any thoughts and advice!",0

"Gifted + Dyslexia experiences please Hi.  I'd like to hear experiences from anyone who knows themselves to be both gifted and dyslexic.  

As an adult I've informally tested as ""moderately gifted"" a couple of times, and this fits with how I did extremely well academically at secondary school (11-18), and eventually went onto postgrad study.

However, my primary school experience was a real struggle.  I was (one of) the worst and slowest readers in my class, getting in trouble because the teacher didn't understand I needed more help.  That teacher told my parents she thought I was ""backwards"".  I remember knowing all the answers though, just as well as her favourite pupil, but couldn't get my hand up that quickly.  Then something clicked around age 10 and my reading finally improved.  This coincided with my moving rapidly up the spelling groups, I think because I was simply good at memorising (I didn't generally recognise the words at all before having to memorise those lists).  In my final year at primary (10-11) there was huge emphasis on us increasing our written work speed so we would be ready to transition to secondary school.  The other kids would always ask me the answers (to comprehension questions etc) because they knew I always knew the answers, but I was just so slow at getting them down on paper that I rarely finished and still looked like bottom of the class.  There was a huge chart on the wall and we would get a gold sticker for every finished piece of work.  In a a class of 45, I was one of two people with no gold stars when everyone else's line of stars had reached right the end of the chart.  The friend I sat with at the time, who was similarly slow, has been assessed as dyslexic as an adult.  As it turned out, my primary school's obsession with working fast was entirely misplaced, because when I got to secondary, any work we didn't get done in class was simply added onto homework.  Finally I was able to take as long as I needed!  And to work alone in peace and quiet at home. 😊 This is when education finally took off for me and I started excelling.

I selected fine art, maths, physics, chemistry for A level (no essay/language subjects, although I got As for English at GCSE).  Then went onto a science degree.

Later, as a postgrad, while reading difficult research level texts, I started to wonder if I might be experiencing some visual stress that was making things harder.  I saw an optician who claimed to offer suitable assessments (I now realise it was probably massively inadequate).  The assessment all went fine except for one page with writing in two different fonts.  One of the fonts was so crazy I was completing overwhelmed and didn't even parsed her verbal question properly.  The disorientation was so much that I failed to express how completely thrown I was by the page. From my mistaken misleading answer, failure to say anything about the crazy font, and because I could read aloud at a normal speed, the optician concluded all was fine.  I had left the optician's, still in a daze, before I realised what had happened and it was too late. 🤦  So my attempts to understand at that time didn't lead me to any answers.

Fast forward to my forties: my home educated daughter experiences persistent difficulties picking up reading and an educational psychologist assessment confirms dyslexia.  My young son meanwhile develops an astonishing vocabulary that seems completely inappropriate for his age.  

Cue my reading up on both giftedness and dyslexia/specific learning difficulties for my children.  This causes me to recall and reflect on my experiences at primary, and realise perhaps I may have a mix of both.  😯

This was all surprising.  Since I'd done fine at secondary/GCSEs/A levels, I'd not understood how I could have a reading difficulty.  And I while knew my IQ from some informal tests in my twenties, no one had mentioned it counted as ""gifted"" - I didn't find out until reading up on the subject for my son.

My gifted experience doesn't fit the literature's descriptions of gifted kids coasting through earlier years of education with little effort.  I always had to work so incredibly hard all through school!

So it seems these two very different abilities have partially masked each other??


Now:  I'm considering a future change in career that will first require a return to studying, in an essay-based subject. I'm wondering whether I can handle it, what the challenges might be, how best to prepare (I have a few years to do so).  And considering an Ed Psychologist assesment for myself.

I would very much value hearing from others with high IQs and a specific learning difficulty.
- Have you also found your opposing abilities appear to mask each other or is that not the case for you?
- Are there circumstances when you find one comes to the fore?
- Have you found ways to compensate/adapt for the SpLD and has that freed your underlying potential?
- How valuable would an assessment be as an adult in this situation?
- Are there any good resources on the giftedness/dyslexia combination?

Any advice or experiences would be great.  Thanks very much!

"Gifted with learning disability? My daughter is 8 years old. At 3 she could write her name and at 4 could read full sentences. She also has an uncanny ability to draw and write stories. At 5, following family and friends recommendation, I decided to evaluate her. She has a high I.Q (not genius level lol), and is gifted in reading, writing and drawing.  Her math levels came up ok and she showed no signs of dyscalculia (which I suffer from).  She never had a real problem with math until last year when she started showing signs of struggle. Her teachers have assured me she can do the math but she panics and ""believes"" she cannot do it. Recently it has gotten worse. I remember when she was 4 or 5 she could add easily... now she can barely do simple additions without using her fingers.  Yesterday she described her feelings when she has to do a math test and it sounded like a panic attack... sweating, heart palpitations, unable to focus...  In summary, she can write, read and draw like a 6th grader, but can't add 2+2 without using her fingers.  As I mentioned above, I suffer from dyscalculia, so it would not surprise me if she has it too.  Any of you can relate to this situation. Gifted in some areas but with a learning disability in others?",0
"I just found out I am Gifted close to my 30th birthday I have been struggling to fit in the society since I was a kid and had hard time making friends in school and after school. I always felt alone and I always blamed myself for it because I make situations awkward. In my late 20’s(last few years) I started to go in depression and early 2022 was my rock bottom so I started taking medication and therapies. It did help a little to come out of depressive state but I still couldn’t slow down my thoughts and how my brain was draining all my energy. 

Yesterday, I casually met a doctor though my wife who is specialized in working with gifted kids and we started talking about my mental state. She gave me Cambridge brain science assessment and after analyzing the results and with her experience she found that I have gifted brain. 

I feel like I just got another birth just by knowing myself and how my brain works. I was able to connect all the dots all the way to my childhood and it’s very overwhelming experience. I am not able to stop thinking about it since yesterday. 

I don’t find myself smart 90% of the time (because I get stuck in my thoughts and my ability to make decisions gets cloudy) but when I am able to control my brain and my vision is clear I am pretty smart. I learned about all the traits and I can relate to most of them.

Can you please share your life experiences how you learned to make friends and your ways out from struggle in daily life.

"Was I a Gifted Kid? For all my life, I thought that I was dumb because of the grades I get on that 1-2 subjects, that subject is of my native language (Filipino) the same way how Americans learn English as their subject.

&#x200B;

Ever since I was 5 (First grade), I was extremely interested in Anatomy and Microbiology. I could name all the major bones, muscles, organs, part of the hearts all on the top of my head. Microbiology on the other hand, I had what I thought was a ""basic understanding"" of it as I was more interested in how the immune system interacted with viruses/bacterias/diseases.

The reason why I was so interested in anatomy & microbiology? Because my mom was a nurse and I wanted to know what the career of my parents were all about since our teacher always asked what we wanted to be when we grew up.

Not only was I interested in anatomy & microbiology, I was also interested in algebra & geometry. It was because, same way how I became interested in the previous topics mentioned, I asked what career my dad had which was that he was an Architect.

I asked what he did and what an Architect is supposed to achieve, he said that he commonly uses A squared + B squared = C squared. I searched it up, it was the Pythagorean theorem.

Me looking up the Pythagorean theorem online led me to learning basic algebra since I was confused as to how letters can add up to become other letters.

At age 5, I managed to learn at least some forms of basic algebra (x+5=10 ; x=5, 2x+3=9, x=3, etc.)

Though I knew a lot of the advanced topics, I never really did well on certain subjects in school, specifically English & Filipino. I only ever knew about how bad I was performing at those 2 subjects when I turned 6 when I received my very first report card. I got a 75 in Filipino and 78 in English (It is the equivalent of a D in the USA). At first I thought I did well since 75 and 78 was close to 100 until my parents explained to me how the grading system actually works, with a grade below 70 meaning you had to repeat grades and a grade below 80 meaning you failed/need improvement.

As time progressed, I was always at least 2-4 lessons ahead on the curriculum on subjects such as Math & Science. On 4th grade I was more familiar to solving simultaneous equations or harder geometry problems like finding the angles. For since on 4th grade I became really interested in marine biology, still retaining the knowledge of anatomy and applying it to marine biology, etc.

I never really was the ""nerdy"" kid, I was moreso the average kid that liked to play sports and mess around class since I never really took school seriously.

I told people my stories about school and I was pretty surprised to know that my friends said that ""You were smart as a kid"" and such.

Was I a gifted kid? For me, I don't think the knowledge I had was really that huge to be considered as ""gifted"", but moreso just smart. The information I knew as a kid is so easily accessible and had probably been by many on the internet by large educational channels to be considered knowing those things as ""special"" or ""superior"".  


Edit: I forgot to mention as to how I failed certain subjects barring me to be labeled as ""Gifted"", but then again, I was kind of advanced on certain subjects.",0

Sorry if this whole post sounds like r/iamverysmart.

From 2014 to 2021, there was a time where I felt like I couldn't compose because of the ""gifted kid burnout syndrome"" and another thing that I don't quite want to discuss on this sub, but at age 19 I've returned to composition when I published my first microtonal piece, since microtonality enables me to do both music and math in one go. 12 notes is too limiting. 

While it's a relief that most of the tuning systems I compose in are systems that no one ever composed in before, problem is, I'm an adult. April 12, 2021 marks the ""rebirth"" and trying something new, but I won't ever get the same kind of appreciation I got before 2014. 

While I make elaborate pieces, the adult world requires a lot of ""usefulness"" and ""making money"". All the adult boring stuff, you name it. A piece with high degree of virtuosity does not necessarily translate to appreciation. I won't rant about it more because it will become r/lewronggeneration, but basically, adult love is conditional and everything you put out to the world, it requires proof as to why its useful, which is to me it's just... I don't have a word for this emotion. Overall, my feel these days is ""what's the point of owning a Ferrari if you can never take it to the track?""

Either way, I see my composition as like, 10 years behind schedule and as something I should have posted as a child.",0
"Having trouble maintaining long-term relationships? As it says on the tin. Does anyone else have trouble making social relationships (friends, family, romance, etc.) last long-term?

For more context, I'm the sort of person who grows close to, and also loses interest in, others very quickly. I suppose the best way to describe it is, if I'm no longer in a shared environment with another person, I tend to lose touch with them very quickly. For example, I stopped speaking to my high school best friend -- whom I would literally share everything with -- less than a year into college. We went to different colleges.

It's been the same with college and university friends, coworkers, and the few boyfriends I've had. And it's always been a very natural and gradual sort of ""losing touch"" where we speak less and less, until we don't really keep in touch anymore.

The funny thing is, losing touch doesn't really bother me. Despite me enjoying these people's company and recognizing that they contribute happiness to my life, I also don't feel like losing them is much of a big deal. I don't really think I've felt particularly sad or upset at a human loss before. And, as expected, I don't face any issues if I ever need to cut someone out of my life completely. Even though social relationships are fun, they're easily replaceable and I can find happiness and fun elsewhere.

I also don't have problems reconnecting with people I've lost touch with. That sounds like an oxymoron, but basically... if these people do come back into my life, I don't feel like there is/was any gap between us. Obviously THEY do though, and I've been accused of being a bad friend/partner, etc. Again, on a logical level, I understand why people would be hurt and angry. Over the years I have tried putting more effort into keeping in touch with people, trying to maintain that relationship, but I always end up getting distracted by new people, or new things.

I have varied interests -- I love travelling, hiking, shopping, painting, cooking, cycling, gaming; many of these are things I can do alone. I don't mind if others join me, but I also don't particularly feel like anything's missing if I have to go at it alone.

I'm posing this question here because I've always been described as gifted my entire life. It has always felt like just another label, like ""female"" or ""European"" or ""long hair"". I have clear goals for the things I do want to achieve, such as getting into college or landing my dream job. That being said, I don't know if my giftedness is the cause of/contributes to my current dilemma.

I don't mean to hurt the people I like (and I do still LIKE these people, I don't really understand why my brain doesn't prioritize that ""like""). If I can avoid hurting their feelings, I would love to learn how.",0
"Please help: overexcitability makes it impossible to function Tldr: feeling hopeless and stuck. Wanting to learn all day makes adult life impossible.

Edit: pls someone reply

I'm finding it nearly impossible to be a functioning adult. All I want to do is learn, and I mean that with no exaggeration. 16 hours can pass in the blink of an eye trying to untangle problems, getting to the bottom of some issue, understanding relationships between different subjects, cataloguing articles; all I want to do is read and learn. It's almost compulsive. It's to the point that I regularly evade important life responsibilities to read something interesting. I have obsessions, contending with existential and religious question much of the day. I also might struggle with imaginational OE: my inner world is the show, everyday life are the commercials. 

I can't focus at work due to this. A question is at the forefront on my mind and I find myself opening a new tab on my work laptop or going on my phone trying to gather more information. I'm (20sF, BSW) a case manager. Although I love helping the particular population I serve, care management has me bored to tears. Documentation, forms, notes. It's insufferable. I can barely do my own errands (and have gotten into trouble due to this) what makes me think I can help others with theirs? The anxiety (emotional OE in general) of feeling like I'm not doing enough or forgetting something is debilitating and sometimes I have to end work early. Messing up makes me want to harm myself and die. I'm just not a conscientious person.

 However I don't know what I can do. I'm not really good at anything. ADHD, possible ASD, poor perceptual ability, poor memory, and poor math skills. Whatever verbal giftedness I might have is mild. At the surface the problem is simple: go back to school, get a new career, ect, but the problem seems to be at a more fundamental level, something intrinsic about life itself that can't be changed. The cyclical nature of life, the tedium, just seems unnecessary and meaningless. I wish I didn't ponder these things sometimes. The anxiety makes me want to die.

"I don't know how I can take this anymore So i'm 15 male and nothing has been going my way as long as I can remember. I was always and still gifted, but I can't make any use of it. I learned how to read at age of 3 and never had to pay any attention in lower grade in anything. I was good at everything but the closer we got to high school I couldnt really do anything.

So the things that fucked up my life. My parents got divorced when i was under 1 year old and I lived with my mother and visited my father weekly. My mom is amazing and I love her but my dad is the biggest asshole in the world. Everything was very strict on my dads home. I had so much anxiety and stress there. Well that is already bad but i'm also an empath and I couldn't show my emotions there. Nothing could be wrong and if something was wrong it was best to act like all was good. I had two younger half-brothers and never had any own space while visiting my father wich I needed badly always. I cry easily and almost everyday but there if I did I would have talk with my father for hours and that made it worse. At the age of 11 I decided I was done going to that shit place and got what i hoped for, but it wasn't easy. You need to be 12 years if you want to decide to not visit one of your parents but my school nurse said i was smart enough to make the decision so i got it. (haven't spoken to him in 4 years)

I liked sports and played football for many years but me and my mother wondered why i was getting more weight while being very active and eating normally. Doctors looked at things and diagnosed me with high colesterol levels wich in short means i am in stress state 24/7.

Now for 4 years i haven't been able to be a full week at school at a time and have intrest at nothing. I don't like school but I like being there sometimes. As an empath I love it when I get to meet my friends and classmates and teachers (well most of them). But after school I am so tired I can't really do anything, it drains me so much. I also can't stand when some of the idiots at school do stupid stuff and act like they own the place.

To add that I am also diagnosed with aspergers and that makes some stuff even worse I can't make myself do stuff i'm not intrested at. I'm also highly sensitive i don't like bright lights can't stand loud noises feel what others feel smell things easily and feel everything that happens and touches my body. I don't know how to study. For 7 years in school I didn't need to study fir anything as I knew pretty much everything so I never learned how to study (if that makes sens).

And all that makes me depressed (which is also diagnosed) and have no motivation in life I don't know what I want to do as an adult never had dreams, but as long as I can remember I only wanted to be normal have a job that I could live with and just chill in my home playing games in my free time and if I would be lucky have a partner but all of that is just stupid dreams.

It also makes things harder that i have sleeping problems can only sleep like maximum 5 hours in school days which makes me like an zombie if I can get out of bed. And when i don't have school I can easily sleep 12 hours. I'm allways tired from all of this.

In the last two months things have gone even worse nothing new has happened I just can't take this anymore i'm just at home while not being able to anything useful and being a waste for humanity. Can't go go school, not enough sleep, can't stand people, I need people as it's the only thing i know how to help my friends. I'm so sressed i have so much anxiety i'm so depressed and want to kill myself but can't do it cuz my friends and family would get sad. I feel so useless and can't do anything with my talents and i'm so angry why everything happens to me.

Thanks to everyone who read this and sorry if i made mistakes in grammar as english is secondary language. I just don't know what I can do as feels like I can't do anything. Evrything just feels so useless.

"Big shoes to fill and a crisis of meaning Being ""gifted"" is completely meaningless if you've done nothing with it, and I've done nothing with it. Less than nothing, in fact. I can't even hold down a job and I'm on SSI as a result (Depression, ADHD, PTSD). The fact of the matter is, I've known since I was a small child that my existence is incongruent with life in this world. I'm much too different. My interests align with that of next to nobody, the way my mind works and the way I regard challenges and menial tasks inherently does not allow me to be as productive as I'd like to be. I just get burned out to the point of physical illness if I even try. To make matters worse, I recently came in contact with my family after a period of estrangement and found out that I have four close relatives that have achieved high levels of success, from writing widely published books, to acting in movies, to being a highly successful influencer. While I wouldn't value doing the latter two things I mentioned in my own life, one thought cannot escape my mind. I am nothing. I only relate to people I meet who also turn out to be queer academics with master's degrees, while I myself have done nothing even close to that with my life, and even that is a limited level of relatedness. It feels as if my entire life has been defined by alienation, and this isn't from a lack of trying. I have a lot of friends. There are a lot of people who care about me, but that's a result of hiding my more eccentric traits. Meaningful conversation only occurs in my life once a year or so, but I wouldn't dare admit this to anybody in my life. Despite being able to relate little to people, I love my friends deeply and I would never risk alienating myself further. 

&#x200B;

On top of giftedness, I went on a deep dive exploring myself and my mind earlier this year, and I was alarmed by the sheer amount of deviation from the norm I experience. My entire world, inside and out, is expressed highly abstractly through synesthesia. It's as if my mind cannot be satisfied with a baseline amount of processing associated with normal functioning, so it processes those things through strange and highly esoteric abstractions. Even the concepts I'm describing now are processed and visualized highly abstractly in this manner. I have many rare presentations, a few with no recorded cases. There's also a chance I'm autistic, though a misdiagnosis is also likely, but that doesn't seem to affect my relatedness much given the amount I'm able to blend in to many social situations and I've found it easy to understand people. Perhaps I've had to learn how people work from a young age out of necessity, being what I could only describe as a minority of one.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, it feels as if I'm a polar bear trying to survive in the Amazon and my only sanctuary is a stream of cold snowmelt as it trickles down from the Andes, keeping me cool enough to bring a sense of calm amid the chaos surrounding me. The most difficult thing I've had to internalize is that in order to live in this world, I will have to disregard my more complex needs in favor of more rudimentary ones. It seems that for some of us, the fulfillment of our safety needs, second from the bottom tier of the hierarchy of needs, is the most we will ever be permitted to fulfill, with great struggle. I fear speaking about this, because it seems like society places giftedness upon a pedestal, where it frankly doesn't belong. People think they need to be smart in order to feel they deserve to me taken seriously, and people with more narcissistic or toxic tendencies often present themselves as highly intelligent for this same reason. 

&#x200B;

In reality, being somebody who's highly gifted, with exceedingly rare forms of various neurodivergencies  and having experienced a great deal of trauma, including multiple forms of prolonged abuse and being witness to and subjected to gruesome violence, I feel alienation to an extreme degree. A lot of people come to subreddits like these, often lurking, feeling as if they would be better off somehow if they were gifted, when in some ways, I would regard being closer to the statistical mean as having a leg up in the world in some respect. Whether or not I'd choose to be closer to the mean if it were possible is up in the air, since perhaps having a unique perspective on life could be valued, but I would like to be happy and content. There's a philosophical discussion that could be had regarding the value of happiness in comparison to possessing some sort of unique perspective or deep understanding of the world, but ultimately, if I'm granted only this one life, I would very much like to spend it feeling content. Finding that contentment is the greatest struggle I could ever imagine. I can go through trauma and process it, and perhaps use it as a way to help people, and I have done so with no intent to stop, but I'm living a life where my needs are chronically underserved and unmet and I don't know quite how to meet them.

&#x200B;

What ties all this together, forming my own personal nightmare is existential dread. The awareness that human existence is nothing more than the sum of biological processes and electrical signals. That our motivations are, at their core, not much more than instincts that formed as defense mechanisms that kept our ancestors alive. Instinct to reproduce, to stockpile, an affinity for social inclusion, the desire to have control over our lives and in some, the lives of others and our instinct for survival. The thought of all of them being bound to biological processes opens one up to the realization that as essentially clumps of wet carbon, most of the things we do and strive for are a result of us having the evolutionary tendency to take ourselves far too seriously. For this reason, I find myself ruminating about the reasons behind everything I do and desire. It's the classic problem of creating one's own meaning in a life which inherently has none. As a Jew, I've become more observant over the last two years, not out of the belief in a God, but out of this search for meaning. I am essentially an atheist. I'm aware that this is little more than a way to cope with inherent meaninglessness, and the idea of most of my choices being ways to cope with said meaninglessness is troubling in its own right. It makes me feel like a chicken running around with its head cut off when I think about my goals and ambitions. Suddenly, the prospect of having a happy life holds no weight. It's torturous.

&#x200B;

Uniqueness in general is misunderstood. Giftedness is misunderstood. I hate to fall into the trope of the person who feels chronically misunderstood, because by doing so, I risk sounding like an angsty teenager, but this is where I'm at, whether I like it or not. It's just that, if I'm to be okay with the fact that I'm nothing more than a literate monkey, I unfortunately have to live within the confines of biological needs that I've come to regard as limitations. I have to survive in this world. I have to make peace with the system. I have to make peace with routine. I have to make peace with hunger, thirst, tiredness, sickness, loneliness and death. I have to work with the part of me that fears finding myself at the end of my life with nothing to show for it and treat it with some degree of respect. I have seemingly insurmountable odds to overcome and I'm scared.",0
"Anyone here familiar with limerence? I’m questioning if my possible giftedness has anything to do with my proneness to limerence (extreme unhealthy obsession with a love interest to the point where you become blind to that person’s flaws). I feel like I can’t love a person in a normal way it has to have a lovebombing attitude, passionate sex, serving them, wanting to know everything about them, having them on your mind constantly, getting physically worked up at the thought of them, holding myself to high standards to satisfy their needs then beat myself up when I don’t reach those standards.

I feel like I only want it when it’s extreme love I get bored when it’s just a normal relationship with limited feelings. I have to be head over heels for them and want them in a pathetically obsessive way.

Some things that trigger them for me: being ignored then met with full attention again or having a small fight then console after it’s like it gets stronger after something negative happens. If they’re clingy then nope it turns me off so damn quick and have even broken up with someone for being so clingy. I love chasing someone and I love mysteriousness and unpredictability.",0
"Are the ""events"" of life neutral and only get their positive and negative labels through/because of our society? I've thought about it and I think there is no experience in life that is worse than another.  If I always drink alcohol to forget the pain of my mother's death (e.g.), then I blame her death for my addiction.  And that's how everyone handles every experience, isn't it?  For some it is the death of a family member, for others (with a different prioritization of their problems) it may be the father who is always working and never at home that is then the ""cause"" of the addiction problem.  For some it is an accident or unemployment.  For some, the death of a family member would be a blessing, while for others, the seemingly ""same"" situation would be a curse.  So does it just depend on what I make of the events?  There are probably societal distinctions between ""good"" and ""bad"" events, but life doesn't make a distinction, does it? 

Still, are the ""events"" in life random? Has everything it's cause? 
Perhaps what drives us into addiction or depression isn't the event, but the ""what if"".  ""What if I could have saved my mother?""  ""What if I had been a better kid?""  The desperate attempt to change situations that have long since ended in the past, that only exist in our heads and drive us crazy.",0
"Newly diagnosed! Hey everyone!

So...I got my diagnosis yesterday (giftedness + ADD), at 34 years old.   
It was kind of a shock to me! Most of my friends, who are almost all neurodivergent, were not surprised at all though!

"What's next? After burn out  Excuse me for my language, English isnt my first language. 

Since may this year Im at home with a burn out. Not because I cant handle my responsibilities of my job description, its because I'm feeling responsible for a lot outside my job. For example the wellbeing of my colleagues in my team, the bad decisions of the management team, the lack of culture in the company and efflux of people. I’m only project employee. 

Since July the company let me go, because we both see no options to reintegrate back in my old job and with this company.

Conclusion: I’m at home, recovering from my burn out. Its my first (and hopefully my last) burn out. The big question that is keep spinning in my head is: What’s next?

I’m in my early 30’s, I’m gifted, HSP and multipotential. Probably I have ADD, only not tested (yet). With this package its hard to answer the question: ‘What’s next?’. So far I had different jobs, in different fields. The only similarity between the jobs is that I worked with people. At all jobs I didn’t stay any longer than 2 years. Because always after a few months, I start lose my interest in the function. 

So, do you have any suggestions how I can get answers to the question ‘What’s next?’. Please let me know!",0
"What is your reaction to alcohol? I don’t drink often anymore, i used to when I was a teenager (I’m not old lol, im 20 I just don’t like to drink anymore)
When I was more social it was necessary as more or less any social activity seemingly involved drinking.

When I was drunk with people I was fine, but sometimes, about 30% of the time I would just wander off from my friends. Being on my own when I was drunk led my mind to weird places. I’d fixate on how different i was, and how it is impossible for me to ever fit it. I’d get really cynical about this and feel a level of resentment for everyone else, like I am better than them. 

I’d think I was some sort of special being, given superpowers and nobody could even comprehend what I was capable of and that’s why I was so misunderstood.",0

"I got laid off and I am trying to understand my inner contradiction Earlier this year, I left my position I had in a firm I was with for 4 years and I wanted to start my own firm. However, I wanted to also learn data science and software. So, I applied for a role as a senior software individual - I was transparent about the fact that I had little experience.

I got laid off two days ago after 2 months. The thing is - there are a lot of moving parts, the company is going through some financial crisis and a lot of restructuring and we got a few new people from another department into our department...

Additionally, I have struggled with ADHD my whole life. But, I finally took control of my ADHD this summer.

So, here is the thing - if I evaluate myself through my own metrics, in this past 2 months - I gained so much value. I basically was successful in picking up an entire new skill-set.

The thing is - my supervisor said, he did not feel I was quite at the senior position. And despite seeing that criticism are very valid, and understandable.  A part of me felt really hurt that I did not meet up to his expectation...

It feels a bit frustrating because even with the layoff - I did super well in this two months, and I feel I hit multiple goals I had set for my own self. Yet, I struggle to get this negative feeling out of being ""rejected.""

I guess it is complicated but I thought I share here because I find r/gifted is the few places that seems to understand some of these contradictions. 

ps: After writing - I think perhaps it makes sense to accept that my sense of rejection without judgement as valid emotion even with the contradictions because the self is so complex, and multilayered. ",0
"Need some career advice Hello everybody. I’m hoping you can help me out. I’ve been working the same job for three years now and I feel like it’s time for a change. Yesterday I applied for a job at a local university as a teacher, but before I proceed I’d like to know if this is the right track for me to follow. 

First some background information. I’ve worked as a marketing manager at a scale up for three years now. My team consists of 7 people and we operate internationally. We work on many projects, such as launching new products and designing new websites, to name a few.

However, I’m extremely bored and I can do my job in one hour a day. There are no possibilities for me to grow within this company. The next promotion would be to become CEO, which I don’t want. Then there are a couple of things I really don’t like in my current job, such as:

- Hierarchy and politics. People earn my respect when I know that they know what they’re talking about, which is often not the case. A fancy job title doesn’t impress me.
- The inability of people and systems to change. I see many processes which are just downright inefficient and for which exist easy to implement solutions. But oftentimes that’s a bridge too far and people tell me that “I want too much”. 
- The workload is too small. I can finish most projects really quickly and to my colleague’s satisfaction (at least, they say they’re satisfied). If I’m not challenged, I feel so bored I just want to walk away and pursue other things that really interest me. 
- Then there are other things but I don’t want to make this list too long. 

These are the things I genuinely enjoy doing and care about:

- Helping and motivating others. I absolutely love seeing people grow. I enjoy teaching them stuff I spent time studying and seeing how it makes their job easier or better. 
- Learning and discussing the things I’ve learned.
- Solving problems in a highly paced, chaotic, uncertain and unpredictable environment. This might sound weird but if somebody messed up I love digging into it and improving where I can. 
- Doing creative stuff, such as coming up with a new brand and thinking about how I would position it in the market. 

I’ve also thought about freelancing next to becoming a teacher. Would you guys think this combination would make sense? 

Thanks so much for taking the time to help me out.",0

"Twice Exceptional? Hi. I'm a 19 year old male. Here's my cognitive profile:

* Exceptional verbal skills, in terms of verbal reasoning, spelling, writing, and vocabulary. This is why I was initially referred for gifted services in kindergarten.
* Poor at mental arithmetic, but seemingly below the pathological threshold for dyscalculia. Despite this, I'm excellent at math in general. I slightly struggled in math initially since it was mostly elementary arithmetic, but I later excelled in algebra and more advanced math classes that are more abstract, such as statistics and calculus. I was taking multiple classes of this caliber before I graduated high school.
* I seem to have developmental issues with motor skills. I can be quite clumsy when it comes to gross motor skills, but tasks involving fine motor skills seem to be alright. I think I may have a deficit in proprioception.
* I never fit in with the nerds, jocks, gamers, or band kids in high school. I was an outcast.
* I'm very hyperactive, fidgety, and impulsive. I have an excessive amount of energy. These can be symptoms of giftedness or a psychiatric disorder, so I'm not completely sure.
* I have issues with sleep disturbances.
* I struggle to maintain eye contact. I often have to copy the social actions of other people in order to fit in, and I have some repetitive behaviors like finger flapping. I also think I had some echolalia symptoms when I was younger.
* I'm a crippling perfectionist. I often won't start something if there's a chance of me failing. This obviously leads to me never turning stuff in or doing important things in the first place.
* I have restricted interests, but they seem to be quite broad and they switch around frequently. Naval history, specifically the Pacific War, computing, math, information security, and a couple of other topics are the most prominent examples. I devote an excessive amount of time and effort into studying these.
* I have the ability to adopt a pedantic speech style (i.e. Asperger's syndrome/HF-ASD) or do other things to impress people, but I restrain myself so that I don't appear narcissistic or cocky.
* My short term memory or my working memory, one of the two, is quite poor. I forget things frequently, yet I did well in subjects like math that benefit from good working memory skills. An interesting dichotomy for sure.
* Excellent long-term memory.
* I have issues with maladaptive daydreaming, which is essentially compulsive or addictive daydreaming that interferes with daily functioning. I have no symptoms of psychosis. I also have trichotillomania, which is compulsive hair pulling. Both of these disorders are highly associated with depression and anxiety, and they seem to provide a form of escape. I've been doing these since I was a pre-teen.
* I seem to be developing purely obsessive OCD.
* My handwriting is poor, but it's still legible. I think my handwriting quality stems from my extremely fast writing speed. I already know what words I want to put on the paper, so I write as fast as possible.
* I was initially successful in college, but I've started failing. I seem to have some symptoms of depression, like reduced motivation for even basic hygiene and a loss of interest in what I used to enjoy. Some of them may be existential, since things that I typically overthink about are not really relevant to the current situation, like climate change or how efficient the engine in my car is.
* I have had passive suicidal thoughts.

Yeah, that was a lot. When I was initially tested for gifted services in 3rd grade, I was actually below the qualifying score on the CogAT that they administered. It's split into three sections—Quantitative, Verbal, and Nonverbal. Each section has various subsets. My school district didn't take into consideration your entire score, or your ""full-scale IQ,"" but rather a qualifying score in the 97th percentile on each section. Unsurprisingly, my quantitative score was just below the threshold despite the fact that I qualified in every other section. This disqualified me from gifted services entirely. I still received gifted enrichment, such as pull out, differentiation, logic puzzles, and participation in chess tournaments.

As a result, I was stuck with the regular students. I did alright in school, though. I had very high test scores (including on the ACT/SAT), but I sucked at turning in homework so my overall GPA was low. I was still able to get into top-tier state schools despite the fact that I had a 3.2 unweighted GPA in high school.

I'm a very self-aware person, so I began to think that maybe I had some sort of psychiatric disorder. Mental disorders in particular have become one of my new interests, so I've been down this rabbit hole of research for quite a few months now. I seem to have symptoms of multiple disorders—Asperger's, ADHD, OCD, and GAD primarily. I was actually diagnosed with ADHD-C and GAD from a psychiatrist, so there's that. I have a psychological evaluation with a psychologist coming up soon.

My intention with this post is not to be pretentious or come across as a psuedointellectual. I just have an interest to learn more about myself. A lot of my symptoms genuinely resonate with the people here, so I feel like I'm some sort of rare case involving giftedness and ADHD covering each other up, such that neither condition was ever brought up or diagnosed by educators. The daydreaming and hair pulling are likely just symptoms of anxiety and depression.

I was worried that maybe giving this information to a bunch of internet strangers was a bad idea, but I felt like this was a place where I could come forward and speak. This is sort of a compilation of all of the things that I've observed about myself over the past few months. I express a genuine worry about the existence of other kids and adults similar to me—people that were never really identified properly. If my psychologist identifies that I'm not gifted, I'll happily see myself out of the room.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",0
"Looking for resources for my highly gifted bf (childhood trauma) My beautiful and incredibly smart bf always told me he felt very lonely in his family growing up (and still is). We’ve been together for 2 years and only recently (he’s 27), after our couples’ therapist made a remark about how lonely it is to grow up as a gifted child, he started getting more curious about his upbringing and looking for resources to help him make sense of his solitude and how different he felt from his parents. He is also easily triggered by sensing himself being unheard and misunderstood by me (when we argue for example). I feel like it had to do with his unresolved trauma. He looked at the book “the drama of the gifted child” and said that’s not his experience so much. 
Is there any literature about the experience he describes?

**edit: he also struggles with extreme procrastination (ex. never managed to complete his thesis because he was too overwhelmed by the length of the writing process, although he actually finished the mathematical proof itself). When he assigns himself tasks he can follow through, but struggles to find a reason (or incentives) to complete tasks assigned to him by others without a strict deadline",0
"""You could be better when..."" => Never good enough I got first tested at 7 years old and later at 16 to confirm it. While not even that smart, only in one subset (math, spatial thinking (Maybe horrible translated)), I feel the circumstances still ruined me.

School was easy without really learning for it like for many of us, but this got me disconnected from my ""achievements"". Due to the giftedness there was no way to really fail it and due to not learning and playing games instead, it wasn't something to be proud of, nothing that I worked for, just the logical consequence of the talent.

At these times I couldn't see any reason to even try to perform better, there were no benefit to do this, school would still take years to finish, grades didn't matter to go to university. But due to presumably able to perform better it was negatively noted, that I'm wasting my talent (Like there is an obligation to use it for something?). In German there is a saying ""Perlen vor die Säue"" (see [1] for context), which rougly translated to ""throwing pearls in front of pigs"" or more freely ""wasting resources for nothing"". I can't remember how many times my mother said this to me.

So I got the feeling, that something isn't earned if there is no working for it involed. If I did well, it was due to talent, but if I failed, it was due to not working enough. This lead to a bad attitude and perfectionism. What have I achieved by myself and what is just talent? There shouldn't be a disconnect but for me there is one, sadly.

This wasn't limited to school. I played okayish chess (good at tactics, bad at openings) and was told that I could be much better if I would learn. Even while just gaming with friends the same thing happend with ""you could be so much better if you would play serios."", not meant to flame, we were all on the same skillevel.

I get that these comments aren't meant to be evil but these make me feel not like I could be better at something but that I am not (good) enough. Most friends don't know about the giftedness, so it just stood out repeatly, which is another problem.

Have you had similar experiences?

For me it helped a bit to find hobbies which I can just do for myself like photography, no need to measure myself with anybody else, so it is okay to be ""bad"" at this and not feeling like I have to be good.
And well, therapy, lots of it.

"What to create Starting a civ or society in many ways would be better than starting a company (or possibly not). Would work if whoever was doing it knew what they were doing

What to create, and why?

&nbsp;

And also What is thought by some of the most notable ppl to be some of the worst civs and societies historically? And why, need to know why

I do not like the current overall state of this world, and I believe the majority (>50%) of the world population is also unhappy with how this world is

Theres 3 biggest problem that really irks me:

1) Excessiveness

- This world is incredibly commercialized that leads to alot of excessiveness that isn't needed in this world, and all of this is incredibly wasteful, a large amount doesn't do any good in this world

2) Mega-controlled 

- A large portion of this world is heaveily controlled by a few group of ppl. Ya it was worst back then when there were fewer ppl or a single human that controlled everything, and everyone

- Technology sites are good and can be helpful, but currently like all? things, its mega controlled by a few

- Mega-controlled is fine if the humans had the best interest of other humans at mind and hearrt, but they dont, almost all of them are greedy ppl unlike the fewer humans proportionally that arent greedy

3)  Lack of kindness

- Pretty much all of the problems is because of most ppl in this world. That's why it's like this. Making the world better is one of the (few) worthwhile goals in life i believe. (And general ignorance and lack of knowledge)

These are just off the top of my brain, I dont think there are any bigger core/fundamental probelms than these 3. Are there any? And why?

&nbsp;

What are other worthwhile goals in life, and why are they worthwhile? What makes them worthwhile that we should look into them

I don't currently think that Machine learning is a good or a worthwhile endeavour in this world. Machine learning  would not lead to any of the good outcomes above, it would not fix or make better any of the core/fundamental probelms said. I dont remember which of the billionares said this, but its multiple, but theres others that said the opposite.  I don't know which is the majority view when considering most notable ppl



The current world is ugly, but I get that it was much worst in the past. What is thought by notable ppl, past present etc, to be some of the worst civs and societies historically?  And why, need to know why


I don't know how anyone could reasonably be happy with the state of this world. There are a few countries/places that do seem better and I do intend on moving there in future

Are there any sites that I'd be interested in? Just link",0

"2.5 year old First time mom here so any advice welcome. My not quite 2.5 yr old is displaying a lot of signs of being intellectually more developed than other kids his age. For example he can count to 20, add/subtract simple numbers, read most of the alphabet, starting to spell out words and read them, can draw people and cars and also generally remember quite complex concepts e.g. why did the dinosaurs die out?. He's been speaking now in full sentences for a good year and now he's asking ""Why?"" a lot. Should add we are bilingual at home and he hears a third language through his grandparents. Havent done anything particular to encourage any of the above; he just observes and learns is the impression I get. He's otherwise a very sociable and happy kid and not advanced in other more physical areas (e.g. he walked late and is quite cautious climbing, just learned to jump). 

A few questions (thank you in advance): 


- is the above developmentally advanced? Google tells me yes, but I know the internet is misleading
- if yes, how can we better support him? Just follow his lead like we've been doing up until now?
- if yes, is this any kind of prognosis for the future? 
- He goes to daycare 4x a week while my husband and I work, but tells he me has noone to speak with as all the kids his age are speaking simple sentences and he just plays with the carer.

"Do you feel the need to be the perfect human being? Since I was a child I've always wanted to be a flawless, cool and impressive person. This need ""worsened"" when I was bullied at school, at 11yo: being perfectly ""normal"" (in a ""people can't pay attention to me"" way) was my way to survive in this school and life in general.

A few days/weeks ago, I finally understood this need only existed to people-please, and that I've never lived for myself (it's a scary realization). I had to be the perfect daughter, perfect student, perfect friend, perfect girlfriend,... Each time I wanted to experiment something (clothes, makeup, date with my ex, hobby,...)

"Increasing frustration tolerance 👋🏼 My (23F) therapist brought up that I seem to have pretty low frustration tolerance, probably due to being gifted and not having to work very hard in school.

I literally cannot stop thinking about whoever it is that I’m interested in and it has become a problem as I have started to invade other people’s personal space and time. 

I currently am in a casual “relationship” with a friend I care for deeply (we have both come to the realization on our own that we don’t want something serious and just like to have each other to lean on for the time being) and I find that I am unable to leave her alone. 

I constantly think about her, analyze how long she takes to reply, and what she says. I don’t want to spend every second of the day thinking about her, as I am pretty tied down with my education right now, but I find that I am obsessing over every little thing that is going on. 

Recently I showed her something from the journal I keep, and she started asking me about it. I started keeping it about a month after we started seeing each other, as a way to write out my emotions and process them, so that I could express them in a way that would make sense and not be too intense for her. I don’t write in it often (less than once every two weeks), but she said that it was borderline obsessive. 

I don’t think she realizes that saying that hurt me, but I also feel like she has a point.

Tl;dr: I occasionally write in a journal to process intense emotions regarding a casual relationship, and the person I am writing about has said that I am obsessive. 

Am I being obsessive? How can I deal with my intense emotional sensitivity? Is there something more than being gifted at play here?",0

"Unbearable existence Contextualism: I'm gifted

Justice of post:

I've been enduring such a multiplex existential dread, and I'm just clueless of what I should do. I decided, rather than subscribing to more damage I realize all of my internalizations considering I'm on the verge of insanity. I've been experiencing major identity issues, questioning the authenticity and trueness of what I claim to be. I'm aware I have the preliminary name, age, height,  countenance but the psychological aspect has been devouring me. I've been reflecting on interactions and previous relationships and have deduced that its objectively impossible for me to create a genuine relationship. I'm a pathological manipulator with the psychosocial insufficiency to stop. Due to me creating variations of my identity, I've omitted the ability to authentically evaluate myself. I've been obsessing over ideations of me due to my nonexistent identity, and these obsessions have mutually been concentrating on a specific imaginative/realistic feature of me. I've realized with this deduction, I haven't been able to love the whole me, only subjective captures of myself which despite understanding the secondary perspective that I should love the whole me, I'm simply unable to deviate. The delusional valuations of these features have been manifesting into delusions, questioning if the ""whole"" me truly possesses the acceptable qualities The flawed me deems. And due to the inconsistency despite physical proof of something. For instance; lets say I ideate myself as a strong individual despite logical demonstrations of my abilities, its inherently insufficient and unpleasable. And due to the overexcitability I become rationale to why I don't possess the given feature, creating delusional reasons or imagined experiences to how I alternatively lost them.",0
"Seeking advice from other gifted parents re gifted child-rearing/education I have two kiddos (both bright and undoubtedly gifted). My oldest is 5-years-old. Spoke first words at 9 months, full sentences by 12 months, and reading by age 3. He is my first kid and I have never been around kids much as an adult, so I didn’t have anything to “base” him off of and didn’t realize how different he was from his peers until this year when he started kindergarten. For some of you with same-age or older kids, do you have any advice for me? Have another very bright child (age 2) and want to have to plan for both of them and not switch schools too often. Has anyone tried out any online programs, done homeschooling? Please share your experiences. Thanks in advance.",0
"Rant+ advice I’m a “child prodigy” on paper. I did amazingly well on a bunch of standardised tests at a very young age. I skipped a few grades and so I will probably enter college soon. 

None of this was of my own choice however. My mom pretty much forced me to do this, but for good reason. I don’t think it’s urgent enough of a reason to treat me like this for years on end, but I can see she clearly thinks it’s incredibly important. 

While this prep thing has traumatised me at least a little, I have no delusions that she might be a narcissist. She did this because she thought it was literally a matter of life or death for me, and I've finally realised that she did this entirely for my good. 

Anyways, you can debate me on this if you really want to, but I probably wouldn't find that helpful because that's not my main focus in typing this.

I’m worried that if I do get into a competitive university, or any university for that matter, I will screw up completely. 

For one, I have at best a moderate passion for what I'm applying for. I was passionate about it when I was younger but burnout and long term resentment killed it. I’m recovering, but I don't see my interest returning to a level that is enough for university.

I also have no close to no sense of urgency. Literally nothing stresses me out anymore, and I have no idea how I manage to turn in what little homework I have every day. 

Lastly, I'm not really that smart. Most people like me were probably incredibly smart, interested and pretty much self taught from a young age. Although I do take in math and science related information much quicker and more intuitively than the average guy, everything I know was shoved down my throat by a very effective teacher. 

I don't see these problems improving anytime soon. I also realised recently that I could very possibly flunk college because someone I know who is very much like me didn't make it. 

It's probably wiser to just not go to college, but a bunch of my test results are going to expire if I don't go. I have no wish to redo them. I also can't stand my mom sometimes and I don’t want to end up in jail for stabbing her or something. That would finish me off for good.",0
"[+30years old] Giftness and ageing Hello everyone! 😊  


Asking out of curiosity: for those of you who were tested gifted by a professional (which resulted with an IQ higher than average), what kind of changes did you witness as you were getting older?  


For instance, would you judge your cognitive abilities to be as sharp as in your youth? Equal? Less? Do you think as much? Have you a high thirst for knowledge and intellectual stimulation still?

"How would you approach self-directed learning?  I want to create a methodology or framework for me to understand humanity. Or, rather self directed learning.   


Feel free to challenge me or add to this idea, but I have come to realize that to address global problems - we must approach the problem from at least these 3 dimensions, (1) understand it through our formal science, especially humanities, and (2) through the lived perspective of our members of our species and we must accept every member of our species experience to be equally valid - (3) and the other two sub dimensions is understanding the market framework and emerging technologies and application of such emerging technologies to address global problems.

I understand that understanding problems from perspective of many may be seen as problematic but I am someone who holds contradictions, and from this perspective - i want to understand contradicting views, values to understand where they emerge .

So, how would you give yourself a crash course on understanding all there is to know about human?

I moved back to my home country and, though there was a higher level there than I had learnt, I caught up and became the top of my class, even one of the top of my city and region. A few competitions and scholarships later I got into one of, if not the best highschool in my country.

"How to deal with isolation? I believe I have psychopathy in addition to identifying with the experience of being gifted.

It's incredibly frustrating because it's like a permanent 3rd person POV.

People are an aggregate of their experience and emotions and it's always been frustrating to foster any type of relationship.

People are predictable and they always act in frustrating ways - my psychopathy lets me be detached - my intelligence lets me store large amounts of information and make connections very fast.

I have no visual memory, but if I see something once, when I see it again I can still recognize that it's familiar, even many years later. Faces, abstract patterns, landmarks, memories, facts.

Try as I might, it doesn't make for good relationships because I often understand in a detached way and predict why and how people are going to react to what I'm going to say.

I can't relate to people or offer what they need, emotionally, to foster a good relationships.

I'm good on the surface then long-term people get tired because they're not getting out of the relationship what they expected - and I don't blame them for that - but it still sucks.

Every time I've put these beliefs to the side and tried to meet people half way, I've been met with contempt, or emotional disbelief.

It's like I'm constantly shattering peoples' realities, all the time, just by functioning in my normal way.

And I understand  how that can be uncomfortable for anyone, but I just can't not do it - or I'm not being myself - and that's the exhausting part.

I can't show up in way people want unless I sacrifice large swaths of my natural functioning and put up a 'mask'. But, I feel that's disingenuous and so I'm resigned to just keeping to myself.

People always feel controlled and I always feel constrained and misunderstood.

I feel like Frankenstein.

"I'm so tired of my brain (when giftedness masks your other mental disability) I'm so tired. Physically, mentally.

I was promoted at work last month, and I've been getting higher responsibility ever since. I no longer enjoy my job, because the time flexibility is no longer there. I have to be *on* all the time. I'm tired. I've tried my best to do my job, but I guess I keep failing and making mistakes. I think my coworkers are secretly impatient with me.

It's so tiring to live with undiagnosed ADHD, in a country where accommodation for ADHD or other mental disability is nonexistent. I'm so tired of trying to find ways to be diagnosed with ADHD, or at least find a therapist who have a not-stereotypical perception of ADHD. Time and time again I try to find help, but I still don't get the help that I need.

Sometimes I wish I weren't born a gifted kid. **I wish growing up I stumbled badly so at least people could see clearly that I've been struggling.** I wish I weren't an expert in masking my shortcomings. I have no energy left to mask these past few days, and people at work seem to not like it. Sorry for not being at my best.

My day-to-day life is spent on working or thinking about working or feeling guilty when I don't think about working. I try my best to keep my focus, and when I can't do it, I just lay in my bed. Trying to sleep, but end up waking up every fifteen minutes due to anxiety. *(What if I miss that meeting? What if I make some mistakes on that report?)* I haven't done my laundry in weeks. I haven't take a shower in the past 5 days. My room is a mess. Thankfully I have a meal delivery plan, otherwise I think I'll be dead starving.

**Am I only worthy when I'm being productive and useful for others? Why do people only put up with me when I'm at my best?**

I want to quit my job immediately, but unfortunately I still have some responsibility that I haven't finished. The quickest I can quit is probably in the next 3 months. In the meantime, I'll be tired and I'll make mistakes and people will assume I'm just being lazy since I seem so capable before.

I just want to rant. I'm tired. I hate my brain. My executive functioning is shit. I hate myself very much. I want to sleep for at least a year. I want to disappear.

Thanks for reading. I hope you're having a better day than me. 

**> Might be nice to hear other people's stories especially those who are twice exceptional, or growing up gifted but it unfortunately masks your disability.** How do you pursue a mental health diagnosis and convince others that you're struggling when the other time you seem very very capable of many things?

"I just found someone who compares giftedness scientific studies with astrology horoscopes Hi, gifted fellas. As the tittle says, this is what just happend to me a while ago. Let me explain you the context:

Recently, I found in a psychology subreddit a post that declared boys are more socially isolated than we girls, and as a person who have been living and observing the opposite, I disagreed.

I commented than introvert and shy girls (specially we gifteds and we tomboys) are easily rejected and bullied by other girls and boys, than introvert shy boys. A guy appeared mocking of my statement and I shared with him/her enough links about giftedness and the social rejection we gifted use to live, as evidence of my arguments.

Naive me, I thought him/her would be sensible and polite enough. This person answered me saying that the definition provided by this links (many from official giftedness webs like Davidson Institute or Enol Association) are contradictory and untrustworthy. This person didn't even make the lil effort to educate him/herself a bit before spoke this:

This person shamelessly declared that the giftedness' traits and description were as reliable and objective as an silly astrology horoscope... and yeah, this person shared the dull description of aries as an ""argument"" to support his/her point. Yeah, this person knew I'm gifted and yet dared to told me that.

I had heard/read all kind of discredits, slanders and jibes about us and giftedness itself, but never I had to struggle with someone who placed an incredibly historically well-documented psychological nature at the same level of a pseudo-science like horoscopes (not meaning to offence those who believe in astrology).

Independently of me being right or wrong about the matter of the psychological post, this guys unpolite ways and wicked baloneis are utterly insulting and unnecessary.
Deeply stupid is the arrogance. 

I still shocked after finding such illiterate vain morron in a subreddit specialized in human psychology, but I'm laughing about it. I'm a cheery girl and I have a good sense of humor.

I just wanted to share this surrealistic experiences with you pals. It isn't the worst thing I heard, it's not the end of the Cosmos, but it's so odd and cringy that is worhty a laugh.

Here I let the link to this guy's comment (cause I don't know how to include an screenshoot with the text), to you can read it by yourselves. Please, don't insult him/her, is a total asshole but I don't wanna start a witch-hunt.

"is (verbal)language a portrayer of reality, as something you could fact-check and then, ""ba-da-boom!"" understand real life situations from a scientific-logical point of view? is this even possible to answer this, or does this have no value at all? I mean, when we're checking a fact to be true (e.g., a criminal having taken such a bad move/action for his own purpose of VOLUNTEERILY doing bad (as for doing bad for the sake of doing bad and hurting other in exchange of 'owns pleasure/benefits)) for the matter of a law court judgement process (major case example), that will define the outcome of the subject of such actions' life, whether for the next years or all that remains. This 'cause we don't want anything to go wrong and do worse/bad to a person, or at least we're constantly trying to do our best at legitimating rights and musts of/for everyone in a society.


The point I'm making, is that, if verbal language is subject to a crime scene's actions, should we really consider it to be worth ""reading-through"" as for getting out any proof of validation of such intent of committing such crimes?
If so, what are the parameters or definition of, both verbal language and intent/intentionality of an individual may I ask?
And how do we explicitly and validly prove that that verbal-language proof of bad intentionality is directly connected or even, for the least, correlated to what the subject's real(?) intent is? Maybe it's gone undiagnosed of serious mental health issues, and maybe it's just as bad (the mental health situation) as the place he/she is put in?
How can we define intent/intention, as that same something that drives someone to do/take a certain action?

Really looking forward to some answers of yours, truly interested in this questioning of mine, and some other of you (I guess and also hope).

"Interest ""addiction"" + distinction from autism? TW; mention of suicidal and depressive thoughts/feelings in the spoilers

The title is a bit exaggerated but to be fair I did just stay up until three in the morning just reading and writing about stranger things fully aware that I have a project with a final due date tomorrow (after already having missed the first one).

I can't focus on more than an interest or two at once, and if there are more than one it's because they are related. I start getting into something, suddenly it's all I can think and care about 24/7, it becomes my reason to live (>!literally since I cling to anything that gives me joy to fight suicidal thoughts!<); I can't bring myself to focus on anything else, even things that I was all over just days before, to the point I start dreaming about it nearly every night because it's almost the only input my brain can draw content from.

I confirmed recently that my obsessions last about a month on average; two or more if it is really intense and I have a lot of content and ideas to draw from and exploit, and a couple of weeks if it is influenced by something else rather than coming from sheer internal interest or if it has little content for me to explore deeper and connect to more personally. Sometimes I get insanely into something and make it a core element of my identity only to forget about it forever weeks after, some are life long interests that resurface when there is a gap or something that reminds me of them and brings me back to it.

At first it feels like the force that drives my life and just thinking about my current obsession makes me feel safe from any problems, but when they start to die down it is tragic and frustrating because I feel like I'm losing what I thought was a key aspect of my life; some almost come as epiphanies at first making me feel like I've finally figured out what I want to do, >!only for me to lose interest on it and discard it and go back to feeling empty and without a purpose.!< I also feel like I'll never find that passion and meaning in anything else again, and then I do, and I think it's forever and I'll never get tired of this new thing, but the cycle keeps repeating either way.

It has felt more intense in the past years and it's starting to concern me for real because when it's not something obviously irrelevant to the course of my life like a show or a game, it can really mess up with my sense of identity and purpose. It also makes me neglectful of everything in my life because something as trivial as a tv show can completely take over my life and appear like the only thing that truly matters and the only thing I need to be happy and alright, which makes it even worse when I can't exploit that interest anymore.

Does anyone else experience anything like this, with this much intensity and shifting this quickly? I know giftedness has a lot of overlap with autism but I haven't found much on how gifted people experience intense interest and I don't know if this is closer to the autistic experience; the short span of the interest especially makes me doubt, but then again like I said some are life long but interrupted since I can't focus on more than one at a time. Obviously my suspicions for this being a sign of autism rather than just an aspect of giftedness alone come from a multitude of other factors and possible symptoms that make me doubt, but I still feel like this affects my life more than it should. I've been considering looking for a proper psychologist to discuss this uncertainty with, but because I don't know to what degree my experiences are merely the overlap of giftedness or if they are actually more akin to the presentation of autism, the trouble doesn't feel fully justified. Plus, I did the Wisc-V, which from what I understand is very in-depth and can identify autism quite clearly thanks to the comparison between the different subtests, and apparently there was nothing notable asides from the overall score. Still, I know if I don't get a straight answer to this specific question it will continue to come up in my mind.

If anyone knows how gifted and autistic interests are distinguished and experienced differently and wanted to describe it I would be very very thankful. I've also considered other things, like ADHD (ruled out for sure since it was the reason I took the test) and different types of bipolar (I don't fit the criteria and the presentation of it as a whole). I just genuinely don't know to what degree this is typical, either for a gifted or neurotypical brain.",0
"my troublesome gifted kid My son is 15 and has always been obviously highly intelligent, but also debatably has ADHD and behavior problems.  Like, it's been bad.  Lots of getting in trouble at school.  We always advocated that he's bored and needs an accelerated curriculum, but the interesting thing we always came up against was the school's attitude.  

It's like they see the gifted program as a reward for the good kids, and since my son has a reputation as a troublemaker, they never wanted to reward him (with an actual appropriate curriculum).  

He is in a kind of special education program right now because he can't get along with others.  It's an off-site tutoring program, and his new teacher, having got to know him in the last couple of weeks is kind of like ""WTF why are you here?  This program is for the slow kids.""  And he's finally under review for the gifted program.  They probably will send him to the university next semester.  

He is really into computer coding and has recently been running physics experiments on his computer from absolute scratch.  Like a screen full of balls bouncing off each other and losing energy with each contact until everything comes to rest.  He really wanted to take AP physics to learn the equations he needs for programming, but he's not allowed to access it from the special education program.  

So the cool thing is, the high school will probably send him to the university to take physics and another class or two next semester.  

Just, it's been a wild ride.  Can anyone relate?  Does this sound like a familiar story?  I'm kind of worried about a 15 year old at university, but I work there, so I would be nearby on campus.  His behavior problem is that he's so arrogant he pushes everyone's buttons.",0

"Finding people in college I don’t think this problem is remotely unique to gifted people, but I do think that the gifted element makes it quite a bit more difficult. 

I started college a few weeks ago at a liberal arts university on the west coast with around 500 people in my class. I have made plenty of friends and I have people to hang out with, but I have yet to find people I can be myself around who will get me. I’m starting to worry that my hometown on the east coast was an exceptional place to find people more like me, given that it was a wealthy area with great education and a proportionally high level of gifted people. To clarify, I don’t think that “my people” will only be gifted people in terms of iq. What I yearn for is friends who share my level of passion for philosophy and other pursuits that I would consider more intellectual.

I went to a liberal arts college thinking it would be an even better place to find people to talk for hours about deep existential discussions, human nature, society, and so on. I had only a handful of friends back home for this, and I think I may have been foolish to expect much more here. But then again, this school has 2000 people so surely if I have patience I will find people? I feel so lonely having nobody who remotely understands me yet. The closest I came was at a party where my drunk self somehow ended up discussing capitalism with a girl. I thought maybe I found someone but then she stated she loves communism and thinks America needs it. I know I may just have to be patient, but that’s easier said than done.

Also, before anyone just says to “be yourself”, that is essentially what I tried at the start, and it resulted in people just being confused by me and my humor. People don’t seem to understand why I want to talk about politics instead of sex, clothing, tv, and other mundane matters of everyday life. 

So, does anyone have advice or experience? I would like to hear peoples thoughts who can relate or sympathize.",0
"Could I be gifted if my IQ is indeterminable? I had an adult autism assessment three years ago, after which I got my diagnosis. During that assessment I apparently scored very highly on the verbal ability section to the point where my assessor said that she would class me as being gifted.

I've been curious ever since about what that means, but all the definitions I've found have been related to IQ. During the same assessment, they weren't able to determine my IQ as apparently my abilities in each part of the test varied too much to get a reliable score. I guess that means I officially don't have an IQ (obviously I know that IQ tests aren't the most reliable things in the world anyway)!

Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? What would being gifted mean in this context?",0
"Contradictions when pursuing depth I’m still struggling to accept that I’m in the profoundly gifted range. 

There is a frequent pattern in my interactions with other people (and sometimes their works, like textbooks) that is absolutely mystifying.

An idea will be presented, and I’ll be confused and unsatisfied because so much is missing. The “big idea”, key assumptions, implications, context. There might be complexity that feels unwarranted or premature, details that aren’t justified. I’ll try to start at the beginning and this makes me feel very stupid (and often I’m made to feel stupid).

When I manage to push through all of this, it’s always very clear that I’ve learned more about the subject than they ever knew, or honed in on an important perspective that they hadn’t considered. I feel I become fluent in the “essence” of the subject and this kind of understanding is totally lacking on their part (though, they may be — likely are — faster in the mechanics).

In general, it’s very lonely, frustrating, and damaging to my very fragile self-esteem. There is a sense that I’m constantly fighting deception: people denying the truth of something that I can see plainly.",0
"Self compassion and invisible shame. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFN8t9SXiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFN8t9SXiQ) 

I recently came upon this video and It really was a breakthrough for me. I now know I misunderstood who I was and who I want to be. I have immense shame and self doubt about my value as a person, not my abilities. I believe I am lazy and useless, since I have not outshone everyone I know, even though I can recognize my natural gifts as being greater than many. This is the contradiction that shame has caught me in. It cripples my growth and happiness. Whenever I am doing work, I hate it because I believe I will be lazy and underachieve yet again, and whenever I am not doing work, I believe I am wasting my precious time and abilities. This has made my life a living hell. I cannot enjoy working, and I cannot enjoy relaxation. Every part of my human experience has been falsely pathologized and injected with shame. The shame I feel is not a deserved result of my state, but the CAUSE of it. My path forward is to first recognize the shame I feel as unhelpful, and ACCEPT it. It cannot rule my life anymore. Honestly this video has brought me so much relief. In the first time in ages, I feel no shame for just existing as I am right now.

Am I the only one who seems to see a superiority complex in this group? I am not accusing anyone however I often find people on here look like they have a sense of disdain towards non-gifted individuals. Most of the posts are fine but some seem to make fun of those insinuating that they are stupid. Some appear to take a different direction as if the gifted people are the “saviors” to lead society for the rest. Maybe I am just sensitive but has anyone else found this sentiment.

"Psychiatrist and Psychologist refuse to acknowledge that giftedness is more than just academics. Is this common?

"Defiance Lately I've been doing more research about giftedness and misdiagnoses (and missed diagnosis). I don't hear defiance spoken about as much (as least not in its own right) as adhd.

Imo gifted adults and pathologized entirely too often. I think people like the idea of smart person, but they don't want that person to have fire.

I've been called defiant in one way or another irl and online bc I don't easily capitulate to things I find stupid. My mom has always hated that I'm very active. She wouldn't let me do sports, and she said black people don't do ballet. She gets mad that I practice my flow arts. So what do I do? I keep myself in shape, take classes and play sports when I'm older and have money. I'm now an amateur flow arts/circus performer, and I dont invite her or any of my family to my shows! If I had listened to her and other naysayers, there are so many things I would never have done and people I would never have met. 

I hope one day to be in a music video, in a movie as an extra or on tv performing. I am told that I would never make it, etc etc. I take things as they come. I think if people worry about 'making it,' they lose a lot of opportunities and experiences in life. Some things in life may be a side hustle or a one-off.

I read an article about how defiant kids & adults are trailblazers. Agreed! I don't wait around for approval. I was the only black female at the nearest Hema group. I'd go more often if it were closer! If I want to train with scottish broadsword and other melee weapons, I'm going to do that. If I had the money, I'd probably be training as a helicopter pilot. 

Imo people will tell you what you like, who are you are, and what your abilities are, and they expect you to comply. They dont want to be questioned or opposed. Maybe this works on many normies, I don't know, but it never has worked on me.",0
"Confused by WAIS Results. Would like some insight Hi,

&#x200B;

First, I should say that I don't think I am ""gifted""--maybe just ""above average intelligence"" (in certain areas, and clearly below average in others). But I thought that you folks on this subreddit might have some insight into the results I received on a WAIS test that I had conducted as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. I was being tested for ADHD and a processing disorder or a learning disability (and was not diagnosed with either, though I still truly think I have ADHD), and I feel that the psychologist who conducted my test did not thoroughly explain my results in a way that makes sense to me. I am wondering if she skirted over certain challenges I might have as I have what looks like a pretty significant discrepancy across different indexes. 

&#x200B;

Here are my full scale index scores:

Verbal Comprehension: 118 (88th percentile)

Perceptual Reasoning: 104 (61st percentile)

Working Memory: 133 (99th percentile)

Processing Speed: 94 (34th percentile)

&#x200B;

I'm noticing the challenges I had in both processing speed and perceptual reasoning in comparison to verbal comprehension and working memory, and am wondering what this might mean. I know that no one here can ""diagnose"" me but I'm wondering if you have any insight or guidance. For some context, I have always struggled significantly in visual-spatial skills (map reading, following directions, visualizing shapes/geometric figures, the list goes on) and this has been a weakness for me as long as I can remember. 

Appreciate any advice you might have.",0
"Realizing just how weird I really am Most of my adult life from 2018 to 2021, I focused heavily on trying to fit in. For the most part, I was able to develop quite a few different acquaintanceships and I appeared to fit in at the surface level. I got by socially because I developed a sense of humor and brought myself to understand how people think and feel. I became a social chameleon with multiple distinct personalities for different social settings. 


Two major events would turn all of this upside-down though. The pandemic and a highly abusive relationship where I would become isolated from my social circles. The abusive relationship ended last year and I found myself thinking a lot about my identity and who I truly was, since I had been running from it for such a long time. I had focused so heavily on how I could relate to others that I had ignored the things that set me apart, and there are a great many things that set me apart that have been apparent since I was a child.   


I joined this subreddit because I had discovered the term ""twice exceptional"" and resonated deeply with it. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD. The Asperger's syndrome, which I will refer to as autism from this point forward has been contested greatly by mental health professionals throughout my adult life. I've been told that I communicate too fluidly, my body language is too natural and I have a much deeper understanding of my own emotions than even the average person, let alone a person on the spectrum. I wasn't diagnosed with autism until I was 12 and at that time, I was also diagnosed with OCD, Major depressive disorder and general anxiety at that time as well. My ADHD wasn't diagnosed until I was 20.   


My entire life, I was told that I was highly intelligent but as far as I knew, there was no documentation of it. I recently opened up to my sister (who's 18 years older than me) about frequently feeling inadequate and stupid and she told me that during my diagnosis, I had been given an IQ test and that the results were ""very high"". I looked into my diagnosis to see if this was true and I discovered that I had scored 150 on that test, which was incredibly shocking to me. In the back of my mind, I always believed at some level that I was average or below average because I've only ever been able to understand things that I saw as simple and straightforward. While I've always felt that there is nothing in the world that is beyond comprehension, I've also always felt that I personally comprehended so little because I *do* comprehend so little. If all there is to comprehend in the world could fit into a library, I'm merely reading the directory.  


On top of that, over the past year, I've explored synesthesia somewhat deeply and discovered that I experience multiple rare and complex forms of it. The entire way I perceive the world is influenced by my synesthesia. While I know quite a few synesthetes, I've never met somebody who experiences it like I do. I even have a few forms about which I have found no documentation. While many people have told me how cool it is that I experience what I do, it has felt alienating.



Very few of my interests are common enough to relate to people about them. Most of my friendships and acquaintanceships have been formed without me ever talking about my interests or passions and I have made up for that socially with humor or by getting people to open up to me. There are people I know more deeply than they know me as a result. I made a post in this subreddit recently talking about how hard it is to find people with similar interests and a commenter suggested that I use meetup dot com. There are no meetups within 500 miles of me relating to any of my deepest interests and I live in Los Angeles. At one point, I was lucky enough to have a friend whose father was a professor in one of these interests and we would email each other on a regular basis, but it has been years. When I was a child, this lack of common interests was more impactful than it is today. I had no interests in any of the things my peers were interested in. I didn't watch any programming for children because I felt like I was being talked down to and popular culture was extremely uninteresting to me. Nowadays, people my age are surprised when I have no familiarity with anything they grew up with. As a child, I was one of the ""smart kids"". Some of my peers would ask me random questions in front of their friends and they would act impressed by the answers I gave, and other peers would be cruel to me for using ""big words"" what I didn't even realize would be considered ""big words"". I started masking in middle school so I would fit in better.



This is alienating. This has always been alienating. I understand that everybody is unique, but the realization that I'm incredibly weird and different is jarring sometimes. The only people I truly relate to are gifted in one way or another. I don't even need to have the same interests as them to relate to them, luckily, but it helps. For years, I've had to hide or suppress most of my thoughts because they alienate me. In the past year, I've made an effort to stop masking and to pursue my interests and discover new ones and it's been wonderful, but it also serves as a reminder that I am weird and different. It's horrifying to think about how difficult it is for me to meet my social needs sometimes. The times where I do become fond memories because they happen so infrequently. It's hard, but I know I need to work with what I have.",0

"Why is my iq so low compared to what I everyone, and what I previously believed? Im 15, never done an actual iq test before but was put into gifted and talented sets as very young child (5 years old - ironically the time I intellectually peaked). I fit the definitions of a gifted child as a kid but never did any formal testing. I don’t know why but after I moved schools at around 7, everything just started to decline intellectually speaking (lost enjoyment of learning, childhood issues). I coasted up to age 12 or so and still managed to get into 1/2nd sets - but according to teachers and family alike I ‘could’ve done so much better’. 

I’ve essentially questioned if I was really as smart as people claimed as I have serious doubts. Recently, I took the Mensa Norway, Finland and Denmark tests online - scoring 120, 128, 117 respectively. Upon receiving my results I was mostly just shocked - why is my iq so low? I started school after 2 years out (left in September 2020, mental health and family issues) so maybe that may have slightly affected it, but the increase would probably be so negligible it ultimately would’ve failed to change much. I don’t really want to give myself an excuse, I just don’t understand why people have frequently lauded my potential yet I consistently underperform when it matters most. Anyone wonder why?",0

"Hyperfocus and Hypersensitivities (Discussion) A common characteristic of many gifted individuals is their ability to maintain extreme focus on a subject, blocking outside stimuli, while also being able to redirect and refocus their attention on said subject after being distracted. While this is true for many, my experience has been one of seeing a great number of gifted people being annoyed and distracted even by the smallest sound. These people prefer working alone in complete silence and isolation.

Since hyperfocusing is a trait so universal among the gifted, that it is often used as part of their assessment, and due to the arguably small but gradually developing scientific literature on the subject, which reveals more and more discrepancies between theory and actual phenomena in the psychometrics field, I was wondering: in which category do you all fit?

"How can I look “smarter”? A stupid but real question. Background: I’m mid-level software engineer currently interviewing for new roles.
I’m in possession of your typical gifted grab bag of traits - highly gifted, highly sensitive, highly anxious, etc. Personality-wise, if you’re familiar with MBTI, I come across as a cross between an INTP and an ENFP maybe? (INFJ is the closest fit) - cheery but hyper-nerd 3000x.

Those things on their own pose enough trouble as it is, but I’ve run into people who can’t seem to get past my appearance. It can be tough to pinpoint as it’s happening, but I’ve been told in interviews that I sound like I’m in marketing or product development (I don’t sound like an engineer - plausible, but I get my point across and it’s never effected me on the job). It also happens when I ask a straightforward question with a concrete answer, and get a response to a simpler, very basic question (anyone with a quarter of my experience would be able to answer), and a comment about how I should know the answer (to the simple question I didn’t ask, but do know the answer to). (Side note - sorry if that was too specific or rambling-last manager was hell). No problems with most engineers once on the job.

I’ve been told it’s in my head, but even at my last job, I’d have a staff engineer (most senior engineer) repeat my comments verbatim and get a valid response rather than a blank stare.
When some people project their imagined persona onto me, that persona is not smart or an engineer. It does not match reality, and it’s very frustrating for all involved. Other engineers were also confused.

In the words of my husband, I don’t look smart - I “look like I play a smart person on TV.” That’s with glasses. Without glasses, I normally look like a typical newscaster. I don’t wear much makeup or do anything to stand out really (unless I’m feeling a migraine coming on, in which case I look fabulous in big dark sunglasses and a baseball cap - my family members call it celeb incognito). I’m also pretty peppy and relatively fashionable. 

Outwardly: I come across as a cross between Meghan Markle and Kerry Washington, with a kindergarten teacher vibe that wants to explain logical fallacies to children (nicely), while feeding them tasty, vegan/allergen-friendly cookies for brain food (omega 3-6-9 acids balanced by need, of course).

I think it's also funny that the INTP subreddit has more subs than most other MBTI types' subreddits when they're supposed to be the rarest lmao. I guess the tragedy of labels is very real. There's also the phenomenon of one being able to skew the outcome of tests like these if they know what they want to get, subconscious or not.

This episode on OGK, Sophia chatted to Dr Gail Post about how to tell your child they are gifted and as parents, do we need to modify our expectations of our gifted kids?

&#x200B;

Here's a quote from Gail:  


> *“If you don’t someone else will, and someone else will put information in their head that maybe you’re not thrilled with or will overinflate the importance of it or confuse them. So, it’s up to us to explain it to them and what I think is really important to consider…is, you need to take into account their age, their maturity, their developmental level, because what you say to a five-year-old is different from a 10-year-old or a 15 year old.*  
>  
>*You have to think about what they can take in and really to talk to them about it as it’s no big deal, just be as matter of fact as possible because it’s just part of who they are.*  
>  
>*It’s not an accomplishment, they didn’t accomplish anything. It’s just who they are.*  
>

"where am I Hi. I recently noticed I maybe gifted. I have disguised my true self to be a normal person maybe because I'm highly senstive then uncontrollably vulnerable, but I belong nowhere.
I also noticed that I'm left handed but for about 29 years I had to change direction to fit myself in this right handers' society. In addition I understood that I had suffered from some kind of dyslexia and mental disorders like separation anxiety.
Nobody had found I caught in the horrible lies until my graduate school professor noticed. I made every effort to protect me and make friends, like remembering literally everything like a movie except words and symbols.

I tried to belong whatever community like asexual, lesbian, or very good students'. But every behavior was not for me and I could not be there. The reality just made me lonely.
I understand just now, why people are eager to find a job, make money, and get married. But I'm not sure a left handed, dyslexic, highly sensitive and at the same time too logical woman can be in the society.
I like philosophy, mathematics, computer science, physics, music, history, economics, excercise, language, art and so on, though I couldn't remember some words or symbols to master them beautifully.
I heard ""you may be good at whatever you do"" from professors but I don't know what to do.

I major in mathematics education because I love mathematics and humanity.
But my dyslexic pattern does matter whenever I take exams to be a math teacher, and I hate this country's education system which seems to make students do not love math or do math. Ironically I am the school hater.
I belong to not so-called friends community never getting me but some deep and sophisticated books or papers.
I understand whatever I do what matters is the people I get along with, but I do not have any friend who makes me naturally laugh, cry, or feel sth.

I, whose world just exploded, am happy to be myself but worried. I recently graduated and don't know where to go or what to do to get a job first.
Should I disguise me as a normal math teacher and understand the world of norm, to change the world though that gives me existential loneliness or emotional scar from the lifelong trauma?
Or should I go to gifted students' school to be in somewhat genuine relationships in my true self's safe zone? Maybe I mix the 'should' things to decide and thougts will change.
I needed to confess somewhere to respect my true self. Thanks for reading the first time as a maybe-gifted self.",0
"Paralysed by too many ideas and interests? Hey there,
I'm regularly having ideas about some new projects I want to go after. However, I'm often just brainstorming and excited but I rarely manage to actually put them into reality. That could be due to strong emotions that ascend when I get in a flow state of brainstorming. When I have that, I'm doing other activities where I can regulate my excitement by dancing, singing etc. (is this me stimming? And is this emotional and imaginational overexcitement according to Dabrowski's theory?).
Do you have any tips for me to actually go after those exciting ideas and not just thinking about them?

Edit: It's probably some kind of behavioral training needed to break the cycle, right?",0
"Therapist/counsellor recommendations in the UK Greetings from the UK!

I'm about to hit 30 and have been struggling with my mental health more than ever recently - this is mainly depression, but I have been anxious for as long as I can remember. I think the depression comes from a prolonged period of doing things I don't align with, for example, going through the traditional school system and then working in 9-5 jobs where I perform very well, but I am not stimulated and just feel like time is passing by and I'm wasting my 'gifts'. I've spent months on the dedicated mental health subreddits and have gone through CBT, but with little effectiveness. I stumbled across a post on one of these subreddits regarding giftedness and it dawned on me after years of trying to figure out why I'm constantly feeling this way (with a life-long drive for doing my own thing) that this is actually the underlying reason (I was in G&T cohorts at school and took cognitive tests to qualify).

Once I went down this path, it became apparent that (at least in the UK), there are not many psychologists/therapists that even list giftedness in their bio and they are all private (i.e. not via the NHS). I'm hesistant to spend money on someone I have googled with no reviews. **Does anybody have any personal recommendations for specialists in the UK who could hopefully delve into my brain and its thoughts?**

Thank you so much - one thing I have found is how little support there is for gifted adults once they are out in the world (beyond school, where it seems performance-driven rather than wellbeing-driven). I'm going to sit a Mensa entrance exam in the coming months in the hope that I will meet like-minded individuals to network with.",0
"savant syndrome/autism hey! this is my first post in here, so let me introduce myself. you can call me icarus, and I’m 18 and a sophomore in college. i am autistic, and have struggled a lot with school up until college, which is actually going quite well. my question-does anyone else have savant syndrome here? the doctors never said “you’re a savant”, but they did declare me as hyperlexic, which is a savant/splinter skill. i was wondering if there was anyone else who has this because often autistic spaces don’t necessarily have room for people on opposite ends of the spectrum in an attempt to cater towards more “average” or non gifted people, which is totally fine, but it make me feel just a little bit excluded.",0
"hi, friends what you guys opinions on space travel? Please, any serious and real discussion? Space and aliens are one of most curious topics for me...",0
"Giftedness, racing thoughts, and anxiety Hi. Does anybody else here struggle with extreme racing thoughts/anxiety? 

I have extreme anxiety ever since I was very little, part of which is due to racing thoughts, and I was formally diagnosed with giftedness at 8/9 yrs old - I'm 19 now. I suspect I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder but it's never really mattered to get diagnosed for it ig so I haven't a diagnosis for that

Anyways. For some reason, it only recently became evident to me that these two conditions might be related, to an extent. Now I don't have any studies to back up my claims, this is just from personal experience -- which is why I thought to ask you guys if you've ever struggled with anxiety related specifically to this:

So, one thing I've noticed over the years is my high intellectual excitability. Of course I always knew about it technically due to knowing I'm gifted, but as I grow older I truly realize what it means to need intellectual challenge - and what it means to find it.

Perhaps because of the fact everything seems easy or obvious, when I eventually find something that's new and challenging, it will make me electrified to a somewhat disturbing degree. Some people have told me what I feel is euphoria, but sometimes it feels too intense and frequent to even qualify.

One common example is when I am learning a new subject that happens to capture my attention. Reading new information and contemplating thoughts and ideas that I've never had before - this makes me *hyper*. My mind will start jumping around as if my brain is mixing what I know with what I've learned, right then and there. This makes my head race. My heart starts thumping and my chest hurts, sometimes I get nauseous - that part's the severe anxiety, I guess. It causes my pain sometimes, if my anxiety meds are not in check and stuff; in the past its made me turn away from studying because of the physical symptoms.

Well, from what I gather, making connections faster, getting brain activity so high when learning and thinking -- that's typical giftedness, right? So I thought, hey, maybe all gifted people struggle with racing thoughts and some degree of anxiety because of this?

I tagged this as personal because it got a little personal, but I wanted to raise this as a topic of discussion. Is this a thing? What are you guys' experience regarding this? Do you have anxiety too? Racing thoughts? If you don't, what is it like to be gifted & not anxious lol? I can't imagine not feeling this way, so I'd like to know it out, of pure curiosity.",0
"Masks and bags, and the struggles they provide. This is my first post ever on reddit and I'm scared as hell. I've commented a few times on different subs, but I enjoy observing and learning through other people's experiences and opinions.

Recently, my world was turned upside down due to some unfortunate circumstances. It's made me think about how other people view me and how I've changed alongside the changes in my life, such as meeting my wife, having children and living in a couple of different countries and cultures.

I found this subreddit after I was diagnosed 2E, highly gifted/ADHD. When reading studies about my diagnosis, the word that kept coming up was ""masking"". In this case it's the one exceptionality masking the other but I've seen many of you refer to this in another sense, as well. As in the mask that we put on to hide our true self.This is something that resonated with me very much and has been a catalyst for my ""philosophical journey"" since my diagnosis.

I identified my mask(s) quite early in life, my mother being an amateur actress likely helped with that. However, what others call masking, I call adapting. My mother would often say that the best actors do not act like their characters, they *are* them. So growing up I, almost automatically, *was* different versions of ""me"" based on who I was with or what I was doing. This was even somewhat comforting, as the true me and my needs never really got prioritized enough to get in the way of my interactions with others. I was the definition of a people pleaser.This did however take it's toll on me as I grew older. How would I choose paths in life that were completely independent of others when I hadn't really ever explored my own identity?

As gifted individuals, varying of course with the severity of our ""gift"", we are by definition separated from the norm. Myself, as what I now understand to be highly gifted, apparently have something like a 1/1000 chance of interacting with someone of my cognitive abilities. I am fortunate to have one friend like that and while we are about as different as two individuals can be in regards to interests etc., the feeling of not having to adapt, of being understood and trusting that he'll make the connections is something I never thought could exist. Our relationship has humbled me and made me a person that no longer blames society for not adjusting to me but rather enjoys learning about, and calibrating, the levels of adaptation required of me in said society.

My point with all of this is that yes, we do likely all mask our gift in one way or another. Weather it be that we dumb down our interactions with others, self medicate with drugs, alcohol, sex or games or hide behind our anger as we curse the skies for the knowledge we are burdened with.However, in order to contextualize what I see as the cause of these struggles, I would like to invite you to my world of duffel bags.

Imagine if the world would revolve around how many duffel bags people could carry and the norm was to have two hands. Having ten, or twenty hands would give you an obvious advantage. Social norms in this world however, say that the optimal amount of bags to carry is three. Carrying more that that is just showing off, while just carrying two or less means that you're not trying hard enough. With our ten or twenty hands, carrying three is mind numbingly boring, it's never a challenge. We look for the situations in life that require more bags to be carried, for our empty hands are deteriorating. If only it would be that lending a hand to others with fewer hands or sometimes even carrying all of their bags was seen as not only a way of bridging the gap between us, but also a way for us to handle our own struggles.

Meeting other people with ten or twenty hands makes us feel ""normal"" in this world of two-handers. We envy the two-handers and wish we were them just as much as they wish they were us. We are different, and we are necessary but that does not make us special or more valuable. We just provide something else. 

I make this post as a person who used to hate myself so much for not fitting in, but when my world fell apart, I finally realized that maybe I did fit in. Cause I had 20 hands that were ready to start building my world back together again.

"A glimpse of a future that could be: Relationships - masks - addictions. How I survived. TLDR: My former wife and my IQs were over 50pts apart. It ended badly.

I was in my early 20s. I had already survived the elementary school mocking, the high school rebelling due to boredom, the first 2 years of college freedom and failures and I was ready for something new to try and fail at. LOL, in my eyes at the time what I was missing is the “social experience” that my peers had. So working a mind-numbing warehouse job, working out, and drinking myself stupid so I could fit in with my “peers”. It was a dream come true. No one expected anything from me.

Then I met her. A girl who saw my potential. We clicked over stupid stories, music and a similar background (both of us half breeds). Everything was roses. I started drinking less and sorting myself out, she started seeing me as someone who could be trusted and go to for advice. Then I met her family and things took a stranger dynamic… they found out I could “see” situations differently, like interactions with corporations, hospitals, social dynamics and apply things I saw and read to help them focus on decisions that would make their lives better. I became a muse for their whole family.

It was glorious being needed. It felt good to be in my 20s and having 50-60yr old “successful” people asking me advice like I was some seer. The family kept pushing my GF at the time and I to start talking about marriage. So we did… and we ran off (putting the family in the position of paying for a ceremony was ludicrous in my eyes).

Fast forward 9 years. I had been clean and only social drank. I completed a degree, landed a very good position as an assistant director in a government agency. Then the bomb dropped (the reason I brought up this story).

You see, my wife had an IQ of 90ish. She was a very pleasant person, salt of the earth type kindergarten teacher.  Her ideas were never revolutionary and she never really could keep up with any conversational topics of the entertaining “what ifs”. It never bothered me really; I would just mask up when speaking to her. She would call me a “nerd” or a “geek” when I would start a conversation about Roman society and its relevance to modern day technology, or the similarities between DNA and assembly language 8-bit coding. It all happened when she saw my resume.

Apparently, she went to update her resume for her biography at her job. IT was half a page long and she was upset because mine was over two pages and she felt inadequate. It was then I realized that my giftedness had afforded me opportunities that the synchronous folks don’t get (unless connected or wealthy).

She upped and joined the Navy the next week. Sailed off in a month and we divorced 6 months later. It was a blur. She ran from being around me, cut all ties and dropped 9 years of a relationship off in the trash.  She finally told me that I was a constant reminder of what she could never do.  Welcome to the first REAL failure of being gifted- inability to retain relationships due to the disparity of potential- whether that manifests itself as dependency, fear, jealousy… it’s a real thing.

(Don’t worry things get MUCH better in life! I got oodles of more gifted stories about work promotions, military life, med school, married to a gifted woman, having gifted kids, raising non gifted and gifted kid… so much fun)",0
"Is it odd if I do have friends? I don't mean this in a way that implies that I shouldn't be able to have social skills just because I'm gifted. I'm wondering if it's wrong if I mask to have those relations. When I hang out with friends my mind calms down and I don't overthink, I actually enjoy going out with friends. But I can't form real connections with them, I can't talk to them about very important things to me like my life goals or  struggles with my sexuality. It's all laughs, which isn't bad but I'm not having the connections that I would want to have with them.   
It's not that I don't like them or anything, I really appreciate their friendship, I know that I can rely on them, they tell me things about them. But I can't open to them because (this might sound bad) I tend to act dumb around them, not in a sense that I am too smart for them, but I try not to think to much to fit in the group.  
Since I knew that I was gifted (1 year ago), I've come to realize that I mask around people a lot and that I've been doing it almost my whole life, it's something I started to do in middle school. It's hard to find a gifted person in my country because there are near to zero programs oriented towards gifted kids.",0
"Struggling with the social life So I don’t know if it is the right place to talk about this but after reading posts, I am curious if people can relate to my story. 

I have been alone (not having close friends) and struggled with having a social life since I was little. I recently realized the friends I used to hang with aren’t really my type of people. They drained my energy and also made me feel even more alone. 

Due to the lack of social life I’ve always felt anxiety. Last spring I was almost burning myself out because I tried to manage my anxiety with school work. 

I went to a school counselor and a psychologist who suspected I could be gifted or maybe have autism. 

School has never been difficult for me and I’ve always been told I’m really curious and open minded.

Though, I have never been able to connect with people because I don’t find their issues and discussions relevant. 

Have you experienced something similar? Am I having anxiety due to the wrong environment?",0
"Signs of autism in gifted people? I have been debating whether I have autism or not for the longest time. I don't have any obvious signs as such but when I start picking things apart, there's so many subtle signs. I recently made a (now deleted) post on r/autism asking what some subtle signs of autism were but I couldn't relate to any of them. I'm wondering if they are more hidden for gifted people. So what do you think are some signs that of autism in gifted people that often go missed?",0
"Personal Life & Philosophy take: So, I've already wrote&published some posts here on Reddit, about my mental health issues and problems in life.
I guess it is no precise time to add onto it any more, just bare with those info I previously provided or, in alternative, I can make a recap here (if you will):

Hi, name's Marco. I'm a 19 yo guy from Italy who's getting almost started - from 2 to 3 months to begin with - to go to university. I've chosen the standard physics course, which takes into account three years for getting a decree - yet I still know very small about how universities work - and other additional two years for getting a master's decree etc..
Don't know if it is too much for me, but guess what, I'm trying to figure it out on my own, given that I don't know how-in-the-world to get a glimpse of it the best I can!
Though, I have to say, I've always been passionate about learning stuff and feeling a newborn learner, who has to learn even more - and it doesn't end ever.
I remember that some days my dad was off work, we could spare some time to get to watch documentaries on TV (the ""Focus"" channel/programme) about space, nature and science.
Can't hide it, I was invested and thrilled in all of it!
I felt like the world was all in my hands, being capable of forging it into a new shape.


But as the days, years went by, I lost touch with this feeling of ""control"". Actually, six years from the tragic and unexpected (at the time) car accident-death of my father in December 2016, I began struggling with this thing I always kept feeling inside of me, even though it was not of the type and the intensity I perceived it all the time before that fatal day of my, and my family's, lives.
It was gradually proceeding to take control over my life, this sense of mediocrity, inferiority, absent self-worth, guilt, and incomprehension.

But some random days it would not be that painful that it'd been all throughout these 5-6 years of severe existential depression, real low self-esteem, severe social anxiety and lost of touch with reality.
As I grew older however, one thing remainded persistent:  the way life shaped to be from that day onward and the mentality&mindset it brought to life as for me.
However painful, ugly, terribly put it may be, I developed - and still am to this day, even after having been diagnosed additionally with delusional psychosis - this sense of reason to explain to myself all the pain I felt all the way through, beginning from changing perspective over things/ideologies more specifically (first I was an atheist, then an agnostic ""believer"", then a sort of a Buddhist thingo believer, then a nihilist, a naturalist, an optimistic nihilist and now what?!) to drastically carrying those shifts in perspective to reality, as an attempt to achieve better life results, tho still keeping struggling to portray any lesser achievement as MY work, and the result of MY  persistence in living...

I am still nowadays too fragile as I could see even the tiniest of one bite, rip apart the soul out of me [metaphore?].
I keep changing view on things all days, I have from time to time mental breakdowns, and suicide instincts that deflect me from doing remarkable things for the little I can do.
Even after all the coping I've tried to do, for the grief and all, and even after being from now 4-5 years under psychological and psychiatric (the antidepressants and else..) treatment. Despite all of this, I have yet to discover a way to fulfill my potential or a way to make myself someone who's better.


(P.s, I may also have something related to borderline personality disorder...).




So, after you've witnessed and read all of this (I suppose), would you be willing to read even further to get an idea of how my thoughts reflect onto my mental stability?
..if this is normal, am not sure. I've come to a few conclusions that I've seen that stay the most over the years as I continue to grow older each on of them. And I'm here to share them with you.
Please take this as an act of courage, of help seeking attention, because this simply means a lot to me; it is very difficult to spread these words out as I cry inside and (I) don't even notice. Thanks.


-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_->>



I come from a very (Catholic-)Christian family.
My grandma the most (-christian).
I have been baptized and have undergone the common ceremonies that a fellow christian family's kid is subject to.
Still, as of now, I can't say any more than this that I'm one of the most skeptical about Christianity (and religion overall) than I've ever been.
I've always been attracted onto discovering things on my own, the surprise of it(!), and questioning everything I could!!

But things weren't meant to be coherent and complementary, as I turned out to think.
The one was meant to oppose the other - tho I have to admit that little to almost no information I have gained/researched over the course of my life in attempt to make a better understanding of it all.


Why was I so involved in religion and science at such a young age?
In my case, it is not a matter of IQ, but rather the feeling of feeling the purest emotions out there.
I remember little, but as for now, what stands out for me is the cruelty of this world.
Add onto it the trigger of a mental health issue big as a mountain, and Ta-Da! You have my perspective (I guess)!
So that's right; it was a way to provide myself better methods to cope with the harsh reality of this world.

I know this world is not all rotten, and that the major traumas that happen in one's life are specific to social interactions or to the social nature of humankind. A-part from the spontaneous physical illnesses that may arise from nothing - all my respect towards those who are suffering - I've seen it all from a social perspective.

Just. Love ain't for me. Or at least not to this day.
My family is at a precarious state of carrying on on life, both economically and emotionally speaking. We are devastated from a State that does care nothing about us, or I should say, those who go under his name. My mother is an all-do for all day long kind of worker. She breaks in halves to make us BREATH FRESH AIR, and yet she is so deeply broken inside that I've got the feeling that she could vanish from one day to another given how she's staying alive these days. COVID-19 hasn't helped obviously. Neither having my family split in two, 'cause of my mother's ""new"" partner.
And given mental illnesses we all deal with in my family, in different shapes and colours, it will take not much longer for me to self-destroy.

All I cared was for a father figure to guide me through the race; for love to wake me up and let me scream ""I love you world!""; But instead all I got, was pain, other's vengeance for little mistakes I've done in the past, betrayal from friends and solitude. Lots and lots of solitude.

I am at the point of which I currently - please, believe me - have no real values and I panic too easily in front of difficulties.



The way society portrays it all; from the beauty of having it all good, beautiful, rich and charismatic; to the way everybody points onto someone else who has done a mistake and thinks of punishment as the best option for letting someone understand (rather feel pain, excluded), instead of permitting one's self rehabilitation.
Wars all ahead, if not globally, from minorities' points of view. The fight for rights, who desperately tries to make it out forever, and instead can't stand a chance against the sands of time, having gotten a centuries and all the world has changed.
Animals, predators and preys.

"Is it bad that I just want to be average? I’m about to start my junior year of high school. It’s a brand new school(Just built from scratch this year) and doesn’t have any AP or honors courses. It’s a technology and innovation based school, so along with a high school diploma, you can graduate with certifications for some trades. You can learn things like programming, crime scene investigation, piloting, programming, carpentry, and a lot more. I’m going to be focusing on programming. I love programming and I’m super excited to go to a school that really focuses on it, but my parents are worried I won’t be challenged or won’t feel fulfilled without taking AP and honors classes. 

I’ve been considered gifted all my life and have always been in gifted programs and advanced classes. I almost skipped a grade but due to my social anxiety, I wasn’t emotionally ready for that. I really struggle with mental illness, especially anxiety. I’ve been a perfectionist since kindergarten and always got amazing grades. Now that I’m in high school, the pressure for good grades is even higher. My parents don’t encourage good grades, they just expect me to get good grades. When I express my concerns about getting bad grades, they say things like “You’ll do great, we know you’ll get good grades! You always do.” It just makes me feel more anxious. 

I also have social anxiety, which makes socializing in school extremely difficult. I tried cyber school last year and it was horrible for my mental health. My depression was terrible and it’d cause me to put off work for weeks, then my anxiety and perfectionism would kick in and I’d do all of the work at once. I managed to finish the year with all As but it was very stressful for me. 

Is it bad that I wish I weren’t gifted? I want to be able to get average grades and be an average person and not have people thinking I’m not living up to my potential or whatever. Honestly I want to focus on my mental health and not my grades. I don’t want to fail all my classes of course, but I don’t want to feel like I absolutely must get 100% on every assignment and test. Plus I mean, is any of it really going to matter in the future? I have no clue what profession I want to go into. I’m simply learning programming because I enjoy it. I’m currently working as a cashier at a craft store and sell crochet items on the side. Honestly I don’t think I’d mind doing that for the rest of my life, maybe become a manager at the store. I just want to be a normal person. Not a brain surgeon or NASA scientist or mathematician or any other “smart people jobs.” Sorry if those examples are offensive, they’re just the ones my parents constantly use to express my “gifted potential.” But so what if I work in retail for the rest of my life? I enjoy it and I make enough money to live. My giftedness doesn’t mean I need to be super duper successful. 

Does anyone else feel like this? A lot of people in this sub are adults so I guess I should be asking did any of you feel like this when you were in high school? Does it get any better once you’re out of the school setting? What types of jobs do you guys have? Also sorry for the ridiculously long post!

"Verbally gifted child that did not qualify for GT program My 6 yo is verbally gifted but did not qualify for GT program when tested at school last year. They gave her an achievement test and she was in 98th percentile for reading and 78th percentile for math. She met criteria for reading but not math. They did not do an IQ test. The school recommended she be tested again this year. 

We had her tested privately because we noticed some anxiety about things children her age usually don’t think about. She still has some anxiety but it’s manageable and she’s doing ok socially. They gave her the wppsi but that was a couple years ago. She had the following standard scores on the wppsi: verbal comp 135; visual spatial 115; working memory 124; full scale IQ 130.

I’m at a loss. Should I have her tested again? Does she even need a gifted program since she is not gifted in all areas? She’s in a high preforming district but does complain about the class work being boring or too easy. She asks me when they are going to move on and learn new things. Will it be stressful to be in a GT program with kids who are more highly gifted? I feel like she’s in a weird in between space.",0
"Giftedness Misdiagnosed as Autism? I had a psych eval recently.  The results came back last week as: no ADHD, anxiety or depression, but a diagnosis of autism/Asperger’s.  

The problem I’m having is the report mainly focuses on my lack of personalized small talk with the assessor.  He said I was very “clinical” and anything I said was in response to prompts.  And I’m like, I thought that was the point of the test?  In school or at home I would have been told off for being off topic?  

Lots of people don’t like small talk, especially in the gifted population.  I was focused on the testing tasks, which I blew through in half the allotted time.  I’m also very reserved and I feel like talking about personal matters in person is something of an intrusion, especially with a stranger.  By this criteria, anyone who’s reserved, task-oriented and focused could have autism.  

I would have been ok if the doctor mentioned repetitiveness, preference for routines, literal thinking, focus on detail or anything more obvious and scientific.  

Has anyone seen giftedness misdiagnosed as autism in their lives or read about such a phenomenon?",0
"I have a tendency to ""people please"" because the people who relate to me are so rare and I don't find them easily A post about adult relationships.

I'm a musician and an astronomy student, and I played a lot of classical stuff as a kid. A lot of my interests are quite niche and it's rare to find people who will speak about them. 

This may sound paradoxical, but... whenever I do find ""one of my tribe"" I ironically don't feel like I can be ""myself"" around them whatever that means, because I also feel like I have an obligation to keep that person together since if it falls apart it's gonna be a while before I find the next one. 

If it's just a casual short conversation with people, I have no problem with that because I don't have to invest into the relationship. 

I wouldn't say this is people-pleasing to the point of toxicity but I sometimes wish I could not only engage in intelligent conversations but also be cringy, messy, and cheesy along the way.",0

"Impostor Syndrome Hello,

I have a problem with being maybe higly gifted/expectionnally gifted/profoundaly gifted (+143-193) and expectation of other people.

I need to given some context of my """"""""IQ test"""""""", I m born disabled because I m born too soon at five month + I have dysgraphia  and maybe (many thing that) dyspraxia

i have no balance and I m in wheelchair

at my 16 years old, I did a surgery due to my disability, it has create many problem and lot of pain .I stayed 11 month at the hospital instead of 4 month.

My surgeon throught, I act ""weird"" for teenager ( act too much like a adult, he was thinking ) and he asked a psychologist to given me a  psychological assessment (mental heath and iq) also due of the pain of surgery

I was diagnostic with PTSD, my psychologist due to PTSD think IQ test was useless but thinking I m somewhere between 143-193 in  first time and 150-170 on second time...

I saw my psychologist during 2-3 month at a regular basis 2 time per week.

But I doesn't see where she saw that...

I doesn't do anything WoW when I was young or particular thing. 0 early sign... like higly gifted (speak at soon after born or learn to read alone)

The only sign of giftness was i m VEEEEEEEEEEERY Curious and I steal book (like encyclopedia, stuff of science or history)  of my brother when he was in high school when  I had 6-8 years old

I dont see me at someone ""Higly Gifted""

I find it is hard to accept my giftness, I see me like a impostor

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And the second problem, It is the expectation of my Friend and my family

My Family see like a genious and have high Expecation for my futur

Even my surgeon who are a good friend now, he has about me high expectation, He said to me ""If you go in medecine and your not in first place of your entrance exam, you will dissapoint me"" and other friend of university who are also gifted,  it is the same.

I have Very Expectation about myself and  it's not a hassle but Expectation of other people  stress me out a lot + I  see myself like sh\*t because i dont cross Expectation of my close family and friend  and I dont know, how to deal with that

"I am overly anxious about my future I (20F) study at one of the world's top universities. My whole life people told me that I was intelligent and gifted. This was till I started high school. I got the highest score in my country's national high school entrance exam. During my high school years, I had severe problems at home that I really don't want to talk about. That was the time I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression. After that, I became just an above-average student. I was trying so hard but not using my full potential due to my mental issues. I graduated with an above-average score but I could have done it better I just knew it.

Everyone expects highly intelligent people to study degrees like law, engineering, med, etc. Since my childhood, I knew the areas that intrigued me and I was passionate about. Therefore, I chose to study Media (AR/ VR Design). I relied too much on academic validation, and now the degree that I study is not validating me academically. I feel hopeless and worthless.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy what I study, and I'm doing great. I still feel like my skillset is perfect for my degree that's why I stand up. But at the same time, I can't stop myself from questioning what I am doing with my future. I feel like everyone's so ahead of their game. I have been taking on more responsibilities than I can afford time-wise. Overworking myself because I don't feel enough. Everyone says as long as you are doing what you love, you will succeed because it will not feel like work to you. It really doesn't feel like work but is it because it is just not smart people's degree or because I am good at it?

I am surrounded by very smart people. Not in my course but in my uni and friend group in general and I think I am just a wasted potential who could have studied law or medicine. What if I don't ever be successful in my career? I am an international student and I worry about not being able to make enough money in the future to make the investment my family made for me to get this education. I am a disgrace.",0
"I can barely cope with time. I need some advice Maybe this discussion would have been better suited to happen on discord, but since the server is gone, I will post the whole thing here.

&#x200B;

To give some background, I am a 27M and I have been officially diagnosed gifted about two months ago. I am waiting to do more tests with a neurologist since she believes I may have ADHD on top of the other curse. I have also been going to therapy for half a year by now. English is not my first language and I tend to be fairly chaotic when writing texts like this one, now add dyslexia to the whole thing, and behold the incoming Crawling Chaos. I am sorry about it, but cannot ask somebody to review this text it for me to tell me if it makes any sense, hence this will have to do.

&#x200B;

While I have a hard time dealing with hypersensitivity, powering off my brain, and a bunch of other things, reality, truth and time are the things that I have the most issues with, at least I noticed lately.

&#x200B;

I would rather avoid talking about concepts of existence, truth and reality. It usually makes me uncomfortable to talk about it due to feeling like a fool, a madman or as having a strong mental disorder. However it could be deeply linked to my issue about time. Hence I'm still vaguely putting the topic in the post this way, just in case, uncomfortably. It may be relevant ..?

&#x200B;

I have no clue as to what is real and is not. I clearly remind that since I am 7 I am wondering as to why I am alive, why am I in my head, what is in the head of others. Is it an existential crisis ? It may be

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now about time itself. I feel insanely overwhelmed by time. I will put in bullet points anything that I have noticed as of late that I can recall about my strange relationship to time :

&#x200B;

\- I can not be bothered to sleep all the hours that I need to feel rested. I feel like it is a waste of time, as eating is some days. Even other basics needs often feel like a waste of time compared to whatever I am doing on that very moment. Most of the time that very moment is learning new things or channeling my mind through video games, or doing both at the same time

\- I feel overwhelmed to even talk about time with people. I always feel uncomfortable to talk about my past or my future.

\- I am always thinking about whatever I will be doing next rather than whatever I am doing at the moment. I feel blind to the present.

\- I feel like that I am always out of time, hence do not even bother to start things that I want to do, or need to do.

\- Work-wise, I never have any clue how much time I will need to do something. That makes me scared and usually procrastinate.

\- I may even be scared of the passing time, I do not know how and why.

&#x200B;

These are the only things that comes to my mind as of now, but I believe that this would be enough to maybe allow some of you to point me out where I am supposed to go from now on, or how to direct my thoughts.

&#x200B;

All these things may also be related to the fact that I am scared to die without leaving anything to the world positive. It could also be linked to a very low esteem of myself (at least this is what the psychologist says), but as of now I have no clue. I am lost. Truth be told, I have never been this lost. Any help, in any form, would be truly appreciated.",0
"Why can gifted people be so nice but also so mean? I see that giftedness and empathy are related in a way. Gifted people tend to have strong sense of morality and proper conduct.

But also, in the comments section and real life, I see gifted or just smart people being so mean for no reason.

I put just smart there because I think there might be a difference between gifted and smart. Meaning, someone can score an IQ of 115 and be gifted while another can 115 and not be gifted. So maybe that has something to do with it.",0

People shouldn’t be mad at someone who’s gifted I don’t understand why non gifted people hold such high standards for gifted individuals. Yet when we meet these standards we can’t be proud of ourself once we meet the expectation. The most recent memory of this was when I put on my story that I got good grades on a state test then someone texted me saying that I shouldn’t post that because there’s dumb people like her and that makes them feel bad. And it’s not even like they try to get a good grades and improve the whole time they talk and whatever during class yet are shocked when they see their grades. They don’t want me to “show off” my smarts yet want me help. It’s so frustrating.,0
"can't stop masking when it's worst, not even before myself. i struggle a lot with the expectations that i ""should"" be more dumb, in order to fit in. I feel not allowed to be successful.

I had domestic abuse in the past and my ex-partner wanted me to be less successful and had issues with women being more intelligent than him. Later on, I had therapy, but quite often therapists need their clients to be inferior to them too. My issues got worse and worse over time. Please don't recomment another therapist, that topic is dead for me; I joined reddit for the Antipsychiatry subreddit initially.

In my experience therapist can't cope with giftedness - their usual belief is that everyone is putting themselves under too much stress in order to achieve more, not less, and they were unable to understand that I often feel blocked by my inner voices and strengthened the masking.",0

"Pour les francophones du sub / For French-speaking people on this sub ~~Zèbre~~ haut potentiel

Bonjour tout le monde,

Au vu d'un sondage récent, je me demandais si les personnes francophones ici seraient intéressées par la création d'un sub francophone consacré à la douance et tout ce qui s'y rapporte. L'objectif serait de profiter du fonctionnement de Reddit pour créer un espace de discussion sur ces sujets ouvert à tout le monde et où il serait plus ou moins facile de s'y retrouver.

L'idée serait concrètement serait de pouvoir discuter de notre petite différence et de ses impacts possibles sur nos vies en français et, si l'envie s'y prête ou l'occasion se présente, de poser des questions sur le sujet. Cependant, cela pourrait aussi être l'occasion de profiter de la fonction Wiki de Reddit pour recenser sous une forme facilement accessible les sources francophones crédibles sur le sujet afin de pouvoir à notre échelle assainir le débat (surtout quand on voit à quel point les neuromythes foisonnent en France.)

Evidemment, rien n'est encore fait concrètement mais si vous êtes motivé pour aider à mettre ce projet sur pied, n'hésitez pas à vous signaler.

Tl;dr in English: I've got the idea to create a giftedness-related sub in French. But people who speak French without living in a French-speaking country are welcome if they want to practice French on a topic they're interested in or if they want to discover our oh-so-marvelous particularities regarding giftedness (but then please take a step back on this precise topic, as we're talking about pseudoscientific stuff)

"I become severely unhinged when I'm not good at new things .6 seconds after learning about them. I just started a new administrative position for which nobody trained me, and I feel so lost and behind and overwhelmed and like a huge drag when I have to ask questions. A task that I feel should take 15 minutes can take me 45 to an hour just because I'm so reluctant to ask for help because I feel like I should already *know how* to do it all simply because I'm a boss. I know logically it's not my fault; this is going as it should, on-the-job training. But the notion that I am not yet entirely competent in all the skills involved in this position and I cannot handle everything all on my own absolutely SENDS ME. The stress is exhausting and is really making me hate this job and question every step I've taken to get here. I just want to go live in the woods and have a huge garden and solar panels and live sustainably and never talk to another person ever again.

I also feel like this deeply irrational disappointment in myself when I don't instantaneously become amazing at new things is why I don't do new things, especially not with or in front of others. I can't tolerate my own failure, let alone allow someone else to see it happen. It's excruciating.

My therapist pointed out I have control issues, and this job has made it glaringly and debilitatingly obvious. It's not that I want to control what others do, but I want to be able to control the quality (seamlessness) of the outcomes. This leads me to crave control over every little thing, and the higher up I go in boss-land, the more I realize I do not have control. Not at all. I have to trust every fucking day that things will just...work out. And it's even more terrifying now that I can hardly trust my own self to do the job right and well because nobody has taught me ALL the skills I need to know, and I have to rely so heavily on other people to do their jobs right so that I can do mine.

Anybody else?? I'd greatly appreciate some camaraderie in this neurosis.",0

"Struggling with finding places to rent as an underage college student. Hello everyone. I skipped a year ahead at school, so now I'm 16 and a fresh graduate from high school. I live in a rural place, so I must move out in order to go to university. I applied to on-campus housing and am currently on a waitlist, and I'm struggling a lot to find places that will take me in while underage.

Most ""find a roommate"" services don't allow underage people to register. I can't book a hostel because I'm underage. There are very few off-campus student dorms that will take me in and they are way out of my budget.

I am wondering if there is a service to help gifted students find housing to be able to study at university. I've heard stories of people not being able to attend their chosen colleges because no accommodation would take them because of their age. Does anyone know anything?

Do you know why? 

One of my theory is that i often try to optimize my fun times to make it useful or do activities like go for a hike where i get like a nice memory and that perhaps i feel anxious because social media scrolling gives me very little value but allows me to pass time passively. 

Or another theory I have is that perhaps social media is just too stimulating for the mind and that causes anxiety. 

Being on reddit and reading gifted post is fine but being on reddit and randomly scrolling thru feed gives me anxiety.  

I suppose the obvious solution is to find more activities but sometimes i just feel exhausted.

"Does anyone else have a really claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in time and space? First of all, sorry if this post is kind of chaotic/jumbled, but if I'd try to bring a better flow into it and connect it all better it'd quickly end up as a complete book combining my entire autography with philosophical ramblings on literally everything on earth, so I'll leave it in some kind of loosely connected bullet point format and it already feels too long like this. I'm wondering whether any other gifted people feel similar because it feels very connected to overexcitabilities, a certain ""wide/global"" way of thinking etc.

\- I have all kinds of anxieties connected to the passing of time, decay, etc. Death anxiety, gerascophobia (fear of aging), health anxiety, probably some chronophobia in itself.

\- Obviously you can't travel through time, and time is limited. You can travel through space, but as it costs time (time itself + money, which is gained through spending time) it is limited, too. Sign of emotional overexcitability: ""They show strong emotional attachments to people, places, and things"". Sign of giftedness: Excessive curiosity. I want to discover so much of the world, and I get deeply attached so easily. The limits of space and time don't allow me to honor this. I don't even dare to do or discover anything anymore. I miss people and places so strongly. It's also hard that the passing of time makes me excessively scared of people passing away. And what about appreciating all the people and things who existed before me, existed after me? I'd like to appreciate everything! Maybe there's some soulmates there!

\- Time doesn't wait for you. So many things I can't experience and it's a waste. I hate wasted potential. Worst of all, I've never had a relationship. Not because of the standard reasons people never had one, but because I really need to feel strongly. I know I can. I get attached easily, but I've only felt this strongly for one (for 5 years now), but it's impossible because it'd never be the right place and time for it. I feel it's a waste of my youth, my life, and most of all of this gift of being able to feel so strongly. Also people getting married feels horrible, because I'm so many stages behind them. As I've spent my entire school life since starting elementary school with kids several years older than me, being ""behind"" and ""skipping"" things socially has caused me a lot of pain all my life, and this people my age getting married thing while I'm like this... feels even worse.

\- I just mentioned, ""right place and time"". You're so limited by this. There's been so much potential wasted in the world because of people not being at the right place and right time for them. Meanwhile I'm jealous that some people just seem to be born into a place and time that seems fit them so well. You can't control time, meanwhile controlling the place has limits & you never really know which place could be the right one beforehand.

\- Time and space make me feel like I'm digging through a narrow, dark tunnel. Any advice anyone ever gives basically sounds like ""Well, dig in another direction"". I could dig in another direction but I'd still be in a narrow tunnel. I'm tired of digging at all.

\- I'm wondering what's the meaning in all this. If there's nothing beyond this reality, it feels all meaningless. NDEs etc., while I'm not 100% convinced of them, intrigue me because there's certain aspects often mentioned about them that seem to fit so well with my feelings. It's said time and space don't really exist there, and the way time and space function here feels really unnatural to me, like I'm actually from a world with completely different physical laws. Take dreams for example - not 100%, but just as an approximation, that ""fluidity"" of time and space in dreams already feels a lot more ""natural"" to me than the rigidity and stiffness of time and space as experienced in the ""real"" world. NDEs also often talk of more intense, more all-encompassing feelings and perceptions which sounds a lot like my intensities/overexcitabilities to me.",0

"Hyper-observance, relationships and obsession/anxiety. Yeah, anyone else struggle with this in any way? 

I’m hyper observant — meaning the moment someone seems to change mood/interest level/communication/lies…I feel it immediately. It’s like I can’t turn off that pattern analysis part of my brain, and my anxiety goes through the roof with my intuition screaming at me that something is wrong. 

I then obsess about it non-stop. Why? What do I do? Will they respond? Are they lying to me about this? Hiding how they really feel? Sometimes that bubbles over into me asking them questions. But the answers don’t really help unless the vibes I’m getting from their actions change. 

A lot of times it’s an overreaction. But no one else seems to get it, what it feels like to be SO sensitive to everything my significant other is putting out energy-wise. And then of course there are the times that I’m right…which is realistically fairly often. 

Gah. I’m really struggling with this!",0
Gifted son won’t go to school My son is six and entering first grade. He was homeschooled last year. He’s very bright and doesn’t care for formal learning.

"DAE have an exceptionally hard time with dating and relationships? My brain loves finding patterns, and I’m very sensitive to emotional shifts within other people. Because of this, I can usually feel when a relationship is winding down — like, when the other person has checked out and is yet to let me know. 

This happens over and over. In my marriage, my ex pulled away from me and after we’d been divorced over a year, he told me the exact time when the emotional shift happened and he checked out. It coincided with when my brain initially picked up on the shift. Currently, I’m dating someone and a month ago the same shift happened. I’ve been internally gaslighting myself because I asked whether he wants to continue seeing me and he insists he does. My rule is I only ask once and then trust the answer, as it becomes pathetic to ask multiple times. Again my brain is measuring behind the scenes and telling me he’s checked out.

"How did you find your profession? Hi! During therapy for various reasons, the most impactful beeing emotional neglect during childhood (enough to be diagnosed with cptsd, but i am on a good way), I discovered giftedness and could relate to it. Did the Mensa test and now it's official that I am gifted...

I am currently doing my PhD in Engineering...but as I resolve my childhood traumas and go through multiple steps of positive desintegration, I disvcover that this doesnt suit me anymore. The thing is: with my hobbies it was allways that i dive super deep into something, I am interested for that for a time, but after at the most 2-3 years I am on an really high level of knowledge there and then it gets boring. I simply love to discover new things. But doing things over and over is torture for me (and my job has reached this level).

Doing theraphy (and for me it definitly is Auto-Psychotheraphy as dabrowski calls it), showed me how good I am with this, how I have a really deep understanding of it (just as with everything I am interested in) and how I would love to transform all the pain I went through in my life to help other people. The thing is....I am afraid. Afraid that after 5 years of learning I will again have lost my drive in that direction, as with my masters degree....

How did you find your profession? Or where you able to learn to pull through with things till the end? If so, how did you learn this?",0

"I'm not an introvert; most social interaction is just so lame that it exhausts me. I've struggled with this concept of being an introvert or an extrovert. As my interest in social interaction and playing the ""can I make them adore me"" game has changed gradually over the past six or so years, I've found it challenging to socialize. My therapist and a few others tell me I'm an introvert, but I disagree. I enjoy the bustle of being around other people. I like to sit and watch. I like to feel the energies around me and predict situations and make stories. Being in public doesn't make me anxious or nervous or tired; it often makes me feel a bit more livened. 

The part I have trouble with is sustaining conversation I have zero interest in. Small talk, general gossip, even catching up on the day-to-day intricacies of life are not stimulating for me. But I am Southern Polite, so I will smile and nod and throw out little lines that show I'm listening to validate the person, all the while, I pick my cuticles until I bleedbleedbleed. Then, when it's over, it's like I can finally exhale, and I have to isolate to recharge.* Sometimes I even binge eat while watching a show I've seen multiple times just to soothe myself.

On the other hand, talking with others about things that interest me gives me so much energy, and I feel invigorated just being around these people and listening, not even when I give input. This dynamic fuels me so much that I forget to eat and I don't want to sleep or stop or leave.

Anybody else feel like this??

*I came up with an analogy for this energy exchange. People have varying depths. When we socialize, we exchange energy from our wells. Some people don't need much, so when we give them our energy, they fill up quickly. Some of us are deeper, so when we interact with more shallow people, they simply do not have the capacity to return our expended energy. Not that they don't want to, but they literally do not have enough to fuel us, so those who have deeper wells always leave needing to refuel somehow.",0
"How do I cope with alienation? I swear this is relevant to the sub... 


I don't know how much you'll relate here, but I've been dealing with a strong sense of alienation my entire life. I know people who bond with others over cars, games... Anything really, except for me. They develop deep friendships, and I feel excluded. I can crack a joke and make people laugh, I somehow understand how to get people to open up rather quickly, often the first time speaking to them. A lot of people know me and seem to like me because of these things, but there's a limit to how much I can realistically bond with people, with the exception of a handful of individuals I've met throughout my life. Literally. I can count them on one hand. People who share the same interests, people who I can have real conversations with, conversations that leave me satisfied. I'm bored with the things most people talk about and it's extremely rare that I get to have a conversation that's truly engaging. 


This is horrifying to me. I want acceptance, I want to bond to people, I put in the effort, but there's a certain kind of genuine interpersonal relationship that cannot be formed under false pretenses. The thing is, my best friend is somebody I've bonded with over these kinds of things, but most of his friends are very different than me and they seem to like me, but I've never gotten close to them. He's very different than me in general, but he happens to be gifted. 


I got to meet up with an old friend today, and he happens to be one of the few people I bond with. We spoke for hours about linguistics, politics (we have highly differing views but that's rarely a point of contention), philosophy, etc. We also have a similar sense of humor and he's one of the few people I can joke back and forth with. I expressed some insecurities with him, primarily involving curiosity that I can't satisfy and feeling too ""stupid"" to pursue them. I told him I felt like I only understood simple, easy to grasp concepts and he reminded me that there aren't many people who could hold a conversation like that with him.


This became another reminder, in a way, of how alienated I feel. I'm mainly here in this subreddit because I resonate overwhelmingly with the experiences people here seem to have, it's the only place I can really talk about these things and I was considered as gifted as a child, but I still doubt myself. Regardless of whether or not I'm gifted, I still feel this alienation. It has me in a spiral or feeling better about myself, ridiculous amounts of curiosity, opening up about my passions, alienation and self doubt setting in and the onset of depressive thoughts and feelings/ loss of motivation. 


Does this resonate with anyone? Is there a way to resolve this? Is alienation an inevitability?",0

Today,  late morning and unusually cold for august. You wonder if you should  have brought a jacket - never mind! There is your mate - you are so  overwhelmed, it has been years! No, a bloody decade since school.

They laughs at you!

sigh... its really one of those days.

Your walk back to work does you good. You feel better - but only slightly. You see your other mate! And run to him. Hi Mate!

They laughs at you! Yes - laughs! at! you!!!

Why!!! You now feel some heat - within you. A sort of heaviness growing from within you. Growing, ready to burst.

You think to yourself, today was fucked up!!! And, you just dragged yourself home.

They were home. Your knight and shining amour! But, the weight. You feel it.

You sit them down. They had to make tea. Early grey.

You  spoke. They listen. You cry. They cry. But after a few hours, you stop.  But, its still there. You see it. You feel it. The weight, from within.  It has been growing even more.

"Extended norms? I just found my IQ report. I remember taking this test when I was 9. It's saying my FSIQ is 167 but I have a hard time believing I'm smarter than Einstein. Reading further into the report, it says that the Extended Norms for WISC IV were used, and that increased my FSIQ by 9 pts compared to simply using the Standard Norms. What is my real IQ? Are the Extended Norms valid in my case? Apparently, I got ceiling scores on most subtests.

Why am I an academic failure if I'm smarter than Einstein? I know he was an academic failure too, but only in elementary school. He graduated from college with perfect grades while I dropped out of college with a 1.33 GPA. I don't even know how I got admitted because I had a shit GPA in HS too. I applied for mechanical engineering (I've been told it was an easy major) and still failed miserably. Am I even gifted if my IQ is 167 but I'm an academic failure? I feel like a retard despite feeling much smarter than my peers, who are a lot dumber than they look. I cannot comprehend how they are doing better on all assignments.

I feel like garbage because they are all going to graduate while I'm this loser dropout that will be forced to do a manual job and always be hierarchically lower than those idiots that managed to get college degrees.

"Can wisc IV be wrong? My child recently had a psychoeducational assessment and the result was average intelligence and severe ADHD. I immediately joined many ADHD support groups and quickly realized something felt off. My child has no emotional outbursts - in fact they have great control over their emotions for their age (8). They have no issues with executive functions - in fact they are very orderly and prone to planning in advance. They're social and easily make friends. They're never late and keep better track of time in the morning than my teen. My child reads above grade level, does math above grade level, teachers tell me they're mature for their age. Their speech therapist states their vocabulary is above average (something we also noticed) but the wisc iv stated their vocabulary is below average. However they are impulsive, extremely distractible when bored, fidgets, etc. In trying to figure out if they were misdiagnosed I learned giftedness could look like ADHD. However, wouldn't that turn up on the assessment? Is it possible the test was wrong, or my child didn't fully understand the assessor's accent or something so didn't understand the question? I want to help them but I can't if I don't know what's going on. Should I do a second assessment?

"Mental games I do not claim to be gifted and have never been diagnosed, however I am searching for people who do the following; play mental games with oneself.

When I was about 5 I started telling stories to myself to help me sleep (I've always had sleeping issues). As I grew older these fantasies became more and more elaborate until I came up with what I call the game.

The game is a grand strategy game revolving around becoming the greatest leader of a setting. The premise is as follows. First starts the prologue in which 100 players enter the game as leaders of nations, planets, organizations, etc. Their goal is to become the sole remaining player ruler in the world. Each player gets starting resources and far going customisation options to personalize their nation. Then, when the game starts it I play all players optimally, so that it keeps being interesting.

Do any of you play mental games this way?",0
"It all makes sense now I was considered a ""gifted kid"" in elementary and middle school. Around the age of 12, due to a series of traumatic events and isolation, I developed severe depression, anxiety and OCD, which caused my grades to slip, I was diagnosed with mild Asperger's, and the rest of my school years were a struggle. Having never learned how to study in the first seven years of school also became an issue. Over the years, I put the possibility of giftedness to rest and tried to go about my life in a different way than I was expected to in my younger years.


I was diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago, and that led to me falling down a rabbit hole, doing as much research as I could about the subject. Around the same time, I went through another series of highly traumatic events that led to severe depression and PTSD, and I began to feel mentally sluggish. At this point, it had been years since I had the opportunity to dive into any of my passions at great depth, and I slowly began reengage with those things while wrestling with mental health struggles in the periphery. I started to think more deeply about the state of my life and my place in the world, and found myself feeling like a tiny atoll in the middle of the Pacific, no matter where I went or with whom I spent my time. 


Nobody I knew had the same interests as me, and that had been true my entire life. I thought being around other neurodivergent people would help, and it did to an extent, in that my communication quirks are overlooked or considered normal among them, but my interests still differ and vary widely. I have one close friend, and he's the only person I feel truly understands me, and he's also quite gifted. He's one of the very few people I've been able to have interesting conversations with in my life. With most others, I keep trying to spark deeper conversations but that normally ends the interaction right then and there. 


I avoided considering the possibility of being gifted, primarily because I despise the label. It sounds conceited. However, I was curious if I could find any answers as to why I am the way I am by looking into it. On top of feeling alienated from nearly everybody, I recently discovered that my brain works in a lot of strange ways, including a multitude of rare forms of synesthesia, several of which, I'm yet to find in another person. While that doesn't denote giftedness, it's something that contributes to this sense of alienation. 


I started reading articles written by psychologists specializing in giftedness and I was alarmed. It was as if they had observed my life and thought processes and listed them out in detail. Perfectionism and self criticism, high levels of curiosity, overexcitabilities (especially intellectual, emotional and sensual), a tendency for introversion, having so many ideas in my head and passions to follow that it feels like there isn't nearly enough time in the world for me learn even a fraction of what I hope to. I often stay up studying until I can no longer keep my eyes open anymore because it's so exciting to learn and frustrating that I'm about to be interrupted by eight hours of sleep. At the same time, I'm dealing with a lot of existential concerns, leading me to feel extremely limited by my own body and physiological needs. 


Amid this discovery, I had another realization when I visited my best friend's family. His grandfather was a physicist, his aunts and uncles all have careers in education and medicine, and he grew up with resources I could've only dreamed of growing up. I was briefly talking about my hobbies with his aunt, mentioned how much I love reading, and she told me she was getting rid of some old books that were gathering dust, and I ended up coming home with books on sociology, philosophy, math and physics, and went to a bookstore a week later to pick up some books to fill in the gaps, adding to the dozen other interests that I'm always curious about. It was inspiring, but also sad because my family was nothing like that. I've spent two days with his family and fit in better than I did after two decades with mine. 


With my family, a few things were common for me. First, my cousins who were around my age would make almost a spectacle out of me to their friends, asking me questions about things I knew. Second, I'd get family members mad at me for correcting them about things they were wrong about, and third, I learned to mask by simplifying my speech and keeping my interests to myself. I still had an overactive mind and lacked any outlet. My dad saw something in me from a young age and tried to help by pushing me, but it had the opposite effect. My mind turned to extremely immersive imagination/ daydreaming just to occupy itself and I grew more isolated. 


There's a lot more, but this post is growing long enough already. Rediscovering this has given me some mixed feelings. Doubt, which I've always had, relief that things appear to be making sense, and shame, since writing all these things out feels conceited and I want to find a way to describe this that comes off as more neutral. When people tell me I'm smart, I typically just tell them that I happen to have an interest in a particular subject and downplay it the best I can. I've tried to attribute these things to autism, but years of pouring my guts out to therapists has led to me having to convince them that I was diagnosed with it.",0

"Can you tell time without a clock? Hey all!

I wondered how many of you can tell time without a clock?! My personal experience is that I can tell time by looking outside, feeling the environment or from my personal perception of time: in general I can estimate the right time with a 10 minutes deviation even if I haven’t looked at the clock for hours. Other examples: I have had periods in my life at which I awoke at 7.00 exactly for months and I found in primary school that I was much more skilled in estimating time: so when in grade 5/6 (in the Dutch system you are then 9-10 years old), we did an experiment with the whole class. The challenge was 3 minutes of quit and when you thought the 3 minutes were over, you stand up. Then, I already had quite a feeling of seconds and I counted. The first person that stood up was about half a minute early. I was the second person that stood up. I was several seconds too early. The rest of my class started standing up after half a minute or so after me. The last person finished when over 5 minutes had past. That was a moment in which I noticed that it might not be that normal to tell time so accurately. 

I wonder if this time-telling-trait (TTT, this is no official abbreviation) helped me feeling and understanding music. And I wonder in case TTT would more common in gifted people, could that explain why they tend to be more sensible to music and the technics of it?

Every single time they leave me, some ignore me, some say “I don’t know”… I’m not sad that they don’t know, it’s completely understandable, but they later said that they didn’t want to know either and didn’t want to talk, and that’s what makes me sad, that they say yes and then leave me.

• I outperform everyone in my class in nearly everything.

• I’m fairly good at molecular biology & virology, and I am trying to learn Calculus.

• I scored 135 on a self-administered Ravens 2 IQ test.

• I am pretty fast at learning compared to the majority, especially in mathematics & tennis.

• My report cards tend to be amazing, with every subject except for listening & speaking being very good & excellent (listening and speaking is satisfactory)

• I love learning as long as it’s STEM related.

• I get extremely upset when I get anything on my report lower then Very Good.

• I know LOTS about computing, from cyber security to programming.

• I peaked 100 WPM in typing when I was 10-11, and averaged 90.

• I got nearly a perfect score on the national test for mathematics, and only got 1 wrong, and I hadn’t even heard of anything in the question.

Against:

• My friends call me stupid.

• My genetics for intelligence are horrible, my Mum is borderline stupid, doesn’t know 1+1 (literally) but my Dad is pretty smart, & my grandfather is one of the best lawyers in NZ.

• My brother has ADHD, and there’s a pretty high chance that a sibling of someone with ADHD will also have it, and ADHD affects intelligence.

"lowering yourself/makeing yourself smaller so you don't become a target I used to do this a lot.

Now I'm in college. I spent 2 years in my first study discipline until I stopped because it wasn't made for me. Now I'm in my 3rd year of my ""new"" studies and everything seems hard af now.

Any tips to help me study, be less scared of working or even change my view on failure?

A bit of context: I had a quite harsh eating disorder in September-December 2021. I spent most of my time sleeping because I didn't have enough energy to do anything. I failed 5/9 exams. Second semester, it began well until time came to study and... I was already terrified. Then my ex left me so it was a hard time too. I failed 3/9 exams in June. Now in less than 10 days I'll have to retake my 8 failed exams but I didn't study on time and during the day I'm too tired to study, so I work only 4 hours a day.",0
"What to do for my gifted son was acceleration a mistake emotionally intense at times… My son was going to enter kindergarten the year of covid he didn’t like wearing masks and I am fortune enough to be able to be at home. So he ended up doing cyber school he did kindergarten and 1st grade in one year. They tested him and he is too 2%iq he got into Mensa. He is very creative music writing reading etc. He has ability to remember many things (selective towards his interest) so for 2nd grade he did cyber again but with days going in to do electives. Now for this school year I wanted to enroll him at our district but I have a horrible feeling he will have outburst as he gets anxiety and can cry or yell at times. I tried earlier in the year to help with that and even tried counseling but they pretty much blew me off because he seems so well spoken and good. It’s just at random times when he gets overwhelmed and has outbursts that are bad. I’m just sooo worried he is goin to not do well if he has these outburst at school. Although he does good he can get anxious on timed tests and math also. He doesn’t like to be challenged at times I feel like he may like just being eons ahead of kids. He is probably ahead even at 3rd grade level but it would be more challenging. Long term I do not feel I can homeschool him I get stressed and we clash over getting him to learn. I really want him to socialize and get in habit of school as well so he can learn some more work ethics. He does some social things thru the cyber school but eventually I have hopes of him getting some independence as an only child I have babies and smother him. 

I feel like I made a bad decision accelerating him. Emotionally he is probably ok considering he is technically a 1st grader but then with the grade jump possibly not. I also feel like I robbed him and me of a year of his childhood. Should I keep him home again And possibly redo the year ? And enter next year as a 3rd grader? My husband just says send him if he fails socially he will learn but that breaks my heart and I know he is so sensitive it will be tough on my son. 

I do think he is smart and capable but then I see he wants to still watch little shows or old Sesame Street (because of the music) and think he is way to young. That would be ok for a 1st grader going to second but for a soon to be 3rd grader maybe not. 

He does like older kids though his one friend of 4 years is going to 3rd and he has 10year old friend etc.

"Covid brain fog Has anyone else noticed any changes in the way they think after covid ?

I tested positive in march 2022 (omicron) and had few symptoms (i was vaccinated) but I felt like my brain went silent all of a sudden, like I had no thoughts in the background. The next weeks, I felt like I was slower in the way I thought, like my memory was blurry.

"I don't know how to improve Hi!!  This is my first post. I'm spanish so my english is not good enough.

Since ever, I have been rare and different from other people. In my childhood, due to my giftedness, I fell different because teachers sent homeworks more difficult than the homeworks of other children; I'm very shy but I always have camouflage it with prepotency. These things made that the school was a nightmare (I suffered bullyng)

Now, I'm more conscient from my situation, I have made friends but I fell that I very differrent from them (they are the typical sportsman that only matter his sport, but they are good people). Furthermore, I recently fell in love of a girl but she reject me, from that moment, I fell that I'm pressed to have a girlfriend, but I'm so shy so it's so difficult for me to flirt. I reached a point that I have no self-steem. 

I hope that  my situation improve soon. If anyone could give me some tips to help me, I would be very thankfull.",0
"Giftedness and Synaesthesia. Hi, first post on here. Still not sure what to think of this subreddit, but interested to hear what people say. I am a gifted person, who also has synaesthesia (genetically determined). I also study neuroscience, hence my interest in this specific subject.

I'm interested in the connection between giftedness and synaesthesia, particularly in those not on the clinical autistic spectrum. Synaesthesia is the natural tendency to process sensory (perceptual) information using another modality, such as seeing colours when hearing music.

Synesthetes have greater functional connectivity between sensory systems, and greater whole-brain integration. The synesthetic brain is biased towards novel connections and cross-modal information processing. This also manifests as novel ideational connections. Synaesthesia is present in all brains to some extent (it is a spectrum), but in those with enough of it to be noticed, it induces a significantly different experience of reality than in neurotypical people. In addition to obviously apprehendable senses, it can cause alternate processing between any two perceptual phenomena. This is not limited in any sense, possible synesthetic states include ideational-sensory phenomena, and even  cross-processing of sensations such as time perception.

According to my own observations, synaesthesia seems to have two ""types"" that occur. Both autistic people and non-autistic people can be synesthetic, but the proportion of it occurring in autistic people is slightly higher than in non-autistic people. Non-autistic phenotypes of synaesthesia tend to correlate heavily with high performance, particularly in creative and ""outside the box"" activities. The reason for this difference is (I assume) the sensory processing issues that come with ASDs. Some synesthetes score strangely on clinical autism measures, in that they tend to be further away from autism than the average person. This category includes myself. In some cases, multiple standard deviations away from ""normal"".

My questions are: are there any other synesthetic people here? Does your synaesthesia impact your giftedness? Do you find yourself making connections other people do not, seeing unexpected patterns across categories? Do you have any insight into the connection between these two categories of neurodiversity? I'm interested in whatever you have to say.",0

"What does it really mean to be ""Gifted""? I'm coming to understand a lot of people here aren't really gifted, some people are trapped in bias and a narrow thought process without the application of naturally using integrative thinking to its full potential.

We can say it's a baseline of an IQ of 130 and a heightened ability to process quantitative information, but the fact that the definition of giftedness varies from place to place makes the concept inherently arbitrary. This leads to the inclusion of people who may not even be gifted, and the exclusion of people who are. 

To me giftedness seems of a pseudoscience, and not really understood in full detail. How can one claim to be gifted and let it change the way they think  based off of this?",0

"did it increase my intelligence? hi, i think most people here assume that the iq is a value that is mostly set in stone. I just wonder what this has done to me, and I've been thinking things through for a certain period of time. it's hard to explain, i did it something like this, i lost my keys during my hiking tour, where exactly is it most likely to have been. well i have walked down a long rocky path which has to record a path that consists mainly of stones. if I had lost it there I would have heard it, I also turned around often, but I didn't see anything shiny etc. until I had pretty much eliminated everything that was impossible or very improbable and what was left with a large probability corresponds to the truth. I don't know if the acquisition of this method has increased my iq, but my logical thinking and its speed increased to a part that I classify as enormous. maybe it just made me smarter and a certain placebo effect did the rest. however, the cognitive boost was really there. it would be as if i had discovered a whole new world filled with deductions just waiting to be analyzed and evaluated by me.

"Am I gifted or just weird? As I’ve learned more about what giftedness is, I’ve come to realize how complex this phenomenon truly is, and thus become more and more unsure about where I stand with respect to it. I’d just like someone else’s two cents on my situation.

I’m still pretty young. But all my life, I’ve just felt a bit…”different”. When I was young, I loved to read. By the age of three, I had memorized children’s books in German and English, even though I couldn’t actually read them. I had a strong ability to recognize words and sounds. I started playing the violin at age six, and loved it. Technically, I was fairly skilled but nothing extraordinary. My biggest strength was being able to memorize, and to play very musically. People would tell me that I was lucky, because musicality is difficult to teach. But I was just playing the music the way I knew it. 

Socially and at school, however, I struggled tremendously. I didn’t fit in, because I was kind of a weird kid and didn’t understand social cues or boundaries, which didn’t make me a lot of friends. I was always daydreaming, and loved books a lot more than I loved socializing. People my age didn’t make sense to me, and I was more comfortable with adults. My teachers had trouble getting me to follow directions. I was always asking a lot of questions and was generally extremely curious about the world. I hated following structure, and often had a lot of trouble controlling my emotions or filtering my thoughts to be situationally appropriate. Though I was terrible at math, I adored science, writing, and reading. Anything with “big picture” ideas was good. For some reason, answers and patterns in these areas would just come to me naturally, which I didn’t really understand. I could understand subjects I’d never taken, and draw conclusions from information I wasn’t familiar with. 

While my parents and those around me told me I was smart, I didn’t really believe them. I struggled in school. I was never the top of my class. I’ve had horrible anxiety throughout my life because of how much I think about things. My parents took me to a psychologist, who diagnosed me with adhd. I know that a lot of my weird ways are because of that. 

But I still don’t really understand whether I’m gifted or not. I’m not a genius or a prodigy. My IQ is probably isn’t high enough to qualify. I’m not Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein. I suck at science and math. I just love to learn and absorb information. I am deeply creative and love to teach myself new skills. My way of thinking about things is kind of strange, and I love abstract things. What does all of this mean? Who am I?

TLDR; this is my long ass life story. Am gifted, or just strange?",0
"Giftedness and obsession with networks and maps Hi everyone!

I was born in Paris and as such, I used to take the subway almost daily. Thanks to hyperlexia, I was able to read the network map quite early and as such, I learnt by heart each and every station on each and every line there was by the age of 4. (And I actually ended up obsessed with it to the point I still know them by heart today and I'm already fully aware of every line extension to come at least until the end of the decade)

A few years later, a TV channel produces and broadcasts a game show that's pretty much a freak show with gifted children (I don't remember how it was named but it definitely was something along the line of ""Little Prodigies"") who have to solve brain teasers and answer questions about their favorite niche subject (so pretty much BBC Mastermind with kids). One of the rounds happened to be having to name the end cities of national highways, then giving the shortest route between two cities using only highways.

So, remembering all of this, **I was wondering if it was common among gifted people to have a keen interest in networks and maps (mostly road and transit maps).**

"Gifted and not reaching their potential? I've never done an iq or was identified as gifted in school I did do very well but due to an unstable household growing up i have a 9th grade formal education.

Because of my daughter who is gifted looked into the subject. Which led me to my own realization...how do I know without being formally tested?  I identity with a lot of the stereotypical ""traits "" you find online  fast learner,  adhd, good at complexity and abstract concepts and make connections. 
With a 9th grade education I work as an executive in a finance company so for me ""finding out "" is more of a cathartic 
Experience . I now know that i can understand pretty much any concept so professionally it is an amazing experience to somewhat help the impostor syndrome.

My daughter's journey is very different i can see at 12 her world view and how she sees her self in it is very different than mine (everyone's is different i know) I can see how the ""label gifted"" and knowing what that means can cause the stereotypical things you read about kids burning out and ""wasting"" their gift by ""not accomplishing to their potential ""
But what are we talking about when we say potential? 
It's an interesting problem we have with the school system which in my perspective  serves only as a tool to guarantee an education that will give someone the knowledge to guarantee (most of the time) a job above poverty line.

So back to my question....what is a gifted person's full potential? It's such an open ended statement ....

"Do you have experience with reading problems as a gifted person? Hey there everyone, I was wondering how many of you have experienced reading problems in combination with giftedness? I have the impression that gifted people are either terrible at reading, preferably don’t even touch a book, or excellent readers that can hardly stop reading books. Unfortunately, I was in the ‘terrible-at-reading-group’, but after being tested at young age, I had no diagnosis of dyslexia. And I already had glasses, so my vision was sharp according to the optician. So, that is something you just have to live with they say. I investigated this feature about myself and I could not add up that everything but reading was so easy. My journey ended last October when I found out that my visual focal points were not working together properly and I was subscribed with prism glasses. These glasses changed my life, since I now can read far more easily and my lifetime of headaches has stopped. 

Can anyone else relate to this story or does anyone have experience with prism glasses?

&#x200B;

If you’re interested, this is the background of the story:  
So, I have never been actually diagnosed with being gifted, but had clear signs from a young age: high vocabulary, extreme eager to learn, quick learner, naturally musically gifted, very alert...

I wanted to skip classes and my parents thought I might be gifted. Then my teachers did not even consider, because I was terrible at reading.

Not only regular reading was a problem, sheet music was a problem as well.

I learn very, very easy from audio/audio visuals, but reading... I really hated it, because I was very slow and it was like I could read the words without picking up the message. As if I hardly understood what I read, while the story was perfectly clear when the story was physically told to me.

I have also suffered from (severe) headaches and I have always been told this was tension headache, while I could hardly believe that was the true cause.

So, last year at age 26, I was considering I might be gifted, after not having really thought about it since the negative reaction of teachers in primary school. I feel quite sure I am gifted, although I have not been diagnosed yet.

But then I thought: why, WHY can't I just read???? I should be able when I am gifted, right? Is there something wrong with me? Am I lazy? So I searched all over the internet and found 2 things: 1) internet page that mentioned gifted people that have trouble with reading and were misdiagnosed with dyslexia (for years). There were experiences with kids that benefitted from prism(a) glasses in this case. 2) I found a doctor that specialized himself with the Utermöhlen glasses. I read what people were treated there for: migraine, ménière disease and PEOPLE WITH READING PROBLEMS. These glasses are a specific type of prism glasses. Prism glasses correct you focal point.

So it turned out that my visual focal points were not in the middle of my eye (it is a sort of lazy eye, but you could hardly see that). My eyes needed correction both horizontally and vertically. For 26 years I have been tiring my eyes and head by continuously having to compensate. Unconsciously I had double vision and two focal points that did not work together to be able to read.

Last October I got my new glasses and reading is a not a problem anymore. Headaches are also not a part of my daily routine anymore. I now dare to try new hobbies and improve skills, such as properly reading sheet music, playing the violin and learning how to code.

"Maybe I was never gifted or is this imposter syndrome...? Hi all,I am a 14 years old biological male from the UK, studying in year 9 or ""8th grade"". I was told that I am ""gifted"" when I was nominated to a gifted programme called HKAGE when I was in Hong Kong (I moved to the UK last year), but this year, I am just uncertain regarding my intelligence or my giftedness to a rather high level I suppose and the reason for that is mainly because I performed really rubbish in my exam in 2021 December and I even failed maths which is one of my best subject or at least supposedly. Anyway, I know there is no other than getting a professional to make a diagnose but I could not get that at the moment yet, so I guess I would just say some of the reason for and against if I am gifted.

For:

* I have strong academic interest:
* I learned calculus this year on my own during my spare time
* I also enjoy learning quantum physics or any physics in general
* I like doing maths problem during my free time
* I was in a gifted programme called HKAGE (was in it for a year but then covid and me moving to the UK)
* I am usually ahead of my class in maths, physics and music
* I have common gifted ""syndrome"":
* I get easily upset by poor grades
* I sometimes feel bored in class (it is more like I want to ""fast forward"" the lesson like a youtube video)
* I generally find my use of language rather formal and advance to a certain extent comparing to my age group. For instance, I got 13 in terms of my fog index with my Reddit comment history.
* I have a strong sense of justice and I feel offended when people are not following rules which can often lead to me feeling negative intense emotions
* I struggle to relate with my peers (but I suspect that might also just because of my poor social skill, selective mutism, autism and social anxiety?)
* I can be somewhat logical for most of the time.
* I was part of my primary school's STEM competition teams and we used to win competitions each year which is held by Hong Kong's leading universities.
* I also tried one of the past paper of UKMT Intermediate Maths Challenge for year 11 or below (""10th grade"" or below) and I got Gold award.
* ""Straight A"" (but that might not be a sign of giftedness in particular)
* I picked a language rather fast: I managed to be better than my class who have been studying Spanish for 2 years more than I do, according to my Spanish teacher

&#x200B;

Against:

* I failed my maths exam twice (once in year 9 and once in year 1)
* I was not as gifted as other story told in this sub by other parents:
* I struggled to memorise the multiplication table during year 2 or 3
* I do not understand knowledge as fast or as easy comparing to how I was few years ago (but that might also be the increased difficulty?)
* My dad and my brother would often consider me as dumb or ""r3tard""
* I have never tried any sort of form IQ test
* I got 100 in Mensa's home test (for all ages)
* I got 118 in Mensa's Norway online test (for 16-17 years old, that was the youngest option)
* I think I am not as knowledgeable comparing to other gifted individual my age
* I am only ahead of my class for serval subjects but not all
* My knowledge can varies a lot in even one subject:for instance, I know some uni level physics but I do not know all GCSE physics content (a national exam in England and Wales for year 11 or ""10th grade"")
* I tend to give up on stuff quite easily when I was younger
* I could not get good grades without revising much, so perhaps it is my hard-work rather than giftedness?

"Being gifted wasn’t such a hang up when I was a kid I really feel bad for some of the “younger” generation who seem SO interwoven with being gifted. 

After lurking for w while it seems like some can’t to recognize it’s only one part of an individuals  personality and they will be ok if they aren’t technically gifted. They may be an amazing artist, musical, still write an amazing book. 

I’m coming at this from the perspective as an  
early 40’s women, diagnosed in elementary school in the early 80’s as 2E and I only recently recognized I was the only 2E throughout school. 

My parents supplemented my education and that partially happened naturally because they were a little older when they had me so my mom didn’t go back to work after I was  born and my dad retired as a 100% disabled vet when I was 3. So I spent way more time with adults than kids. 

Anyone else ?",0
"Low-sensitivity resources? Heya! I'm looking for resources on low-sensitivity. Whenever I try to look for it I only get advice for high-sensitive individuals or at most some short articles directed at parents for low-sensitive children, neither of which are helpful for me.

I know that, probably due to my highly giftedness, I'm pretty low sensitive when it comes to vision and especially touch and it's caused numerous problems in my life already, so I would really like to read about some ways to handle it more effectively. 

Some examples of what I struggle with: 
- I'm pretty restless
- Don't feel pain very well
- Always want to chew on stuff (which makes me want to eat a lot as well)
- Notice very little about my environment (also in traffic)
- Etc.

Thanks for your help!!",0
"I got my iq results back and I don’t know what to think of them I have always assumed my IQ to be in the range of 90 to 100 but I never expected my iq to fall into the exponentially gifted category. I never knew I was capable of this I thought I wasn’t smart. I have bad grades in school, I’m always in my head, and never paying attention. I took a Mensa IQ test after I saved up a bit of money. I’ve always been interested in IQ but never thought of myself as gifted or special. I love space and technology science and engineering I’ve been doing these things since I was young I’ve been called smart or intelligent before but never let it cross my mind this whole thing is mind boggling I don’t know what to do.",0
"High WISC score 20+ years ago. Long story short, I took the WISC-III when I was 7. I scored in the 99.9 percentile range and was identified gifted accordingly.

I did about 3 months in a gifted program and hated it due to work load primarily. I went back into the normal system and never really pursued any enrichment after that.

Now after 20+ years, I want to dive back into this world.

Any tips? Any organizations or groups I should be looking into? Is there any benefit to retesting now?",0
"Give Advice or No? In the last few months I've had such a hard time of it with certain people (irl). I can see clearly what will happen to them, ie that if they continue to act/behave in a certain way that it will cause long term problems for them engaging with other people. Example - if you don't tone x down the others will start to distance themselves. Or - you really should make more of an effort to listen, your ideas are good but you need to listen to their concerns or you won't build trust with them. 

So I've tried to give advice to them or forewarn them, or ask them to at least consider what I think in that kind of way. Some people do listen and they're better for it. But recently my attempts to do what I've usually done for people I consider friends haven't really worked out. This one in particular is really bothering me. 

So I was talking to this person, let's call them A. So I had texted A over an issue that needed urgent attention. Afterwards A pulled me up and said they were unhappy with how I spoke to them - which ok fair enough I make mistakes too. So I apologised and then they said this was how I always spoke to them. I said in the heat of the moment in that instance I could understand they would unhappy with how I spoke but could not accept that how I acted just then and always was no different. 

Anyways one thing leads to another so I decide to pull up A on their general attitude to me and everyone else. They can be intimidating/pushy and occasionally dismissive, and I would say disrespectful. This causes a back and forth. A's answers are vague and avoidant on these points, to which I say they're not being straight or genuine. To which they respond that I am being controlling even asking that. To which I say they're being hypocritical, how can they complain about they way I talk to them but completely refuse to engage which how they talk to me? Then I was blocked.

What I want to know is this. In this case or a similar situation should I push the issue? Or should I let them fend for themselves? I just want them to reach their potential. I mean the outcome here was not ideal for me but I would much prefer this than to see someone not reach their potential. I will say though at the same time I am so f***ing tired of being attacked just because I think and act differently to everyone else - they assume stuff about me for absolutely no reason. Is there anything I can do to reduce this frustration?",0

"How do you study ? First of all, please don't judge me for all of this. I've never talked about this to anyone excepted my parents and my previous therapist, so I hope this post will be met with kindness.

I have always been different. I've always thought it was autism (I've never been diagnosed, but even my previous therapist told me I was probably autistic but didn't had enough time to diagnose me), but there is something else.

Since as long as I remember, people (particularly teachers) always told me that I have ""incredible capacities, but no school spirit"". For example : I learnt english by myself (it isn't my birth language) because I wanted to play Undertale. Before Undertale, my grades in english were extremely bad : I went from an average of 7/20 to an average of 19/20. I could technically have learned english at school, like a normal student, but I couldn't : it was too boring.

My primary school teachers told me I was gifted, because I had good grades at the time, but I've never believed them. However... I've recently realized that I have never truly worked a single day of my life. I have always did the bare minimum : went to class, trusted my memory to remember most of the things... and that's all. I stopped doing any school exercise at 11, stopped reading my lessons at 14, spent almost all my time on internet from age 12 to age 18, but I still had my high school diploma and other high-level music diplomas. Most of my friends had to work their ass off for it.

You could think this is cool, but it is actually a huge problem. Now I don't know how to work, because I've never had to. I have dreams, studies I want to do, but I literally don't know how to work for them. Without working, I am still average in most of the subjects I want to study, but I am extremely bad in science, which is a shame because my studies rely quite a lot on it. And I have no idea on how to study science. I go to class, read my lessons, I even do some exercises sometimes, and while for everything else it would be more than enough, for science it is clearly not enough because I fail.

I have enough of being average at everything and bad at science, I know I could do a lot more but I don't know how. I know it would GREATLY help if the lessons were entertaining and ""fun"", but I don't know how to transform my science lessons into entertaining subjects I could deep dive into, like Undertale.

So my question is : **how do you work/study ? Do you know any ressources which could help me to study ?** I still don't believe I'm gifted, but I'm willing to try everything so that's why I'm asking you.",0
"Was my English teacher gifted? My old high school English teacher remains as one of my favorite people, and I’m starting to think she may have been gifted. 

She was quite a precocious student, but she never had the resources to make anything huge out of her life. For starters, she is a voracious reader, devouring any form of text she can get her hands on, and her class is infamous for its level of challenge. She was making freshman students do college level work, and at one point, she was told by the superintendent to dial it back.  She still pushed students though. By my senior year, she was having us write graduate level papers no less than 10 pages, precise MLA, and with annotated bibliographies to boot. She’d make up read at least 30 pages of an article for homework every night and quiz us on it the next day. (As a more specific example of what I remember, she made us annotate a chapter of our choosing of this book in my sophomore year: https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/contemporary-perspectives-on-rhetoric-3rd-edition_karen-a-foss_robert-trapp/338468/item/52700168/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlemWBhDUARIsAFp1rLUbda81U3wxWXBQVKNbW4TJt-VOd1aOT2yhuWyhXzGv6SMgWMFX63saAmv4EALw_wcB#isbn=1577662059&idiq=52700168). 

Secondly, she excelled in school. When she was in 8th grade, she took the ACT and received a 25, and by the time she was a sophomore, she received a score of 35. She also has never received anything less than an A her entire life, extending all the way up to her getting her Master’s degree. She once had a professor give her an F on a perfect paper because he said that she needed to know “what it felt like to fail” (he changed the grade at the end of the year, but it was in as a 0 until the last day of the semester [she told me how much it made her cry]). Keep in mind she got pregnant during high school and still continued to pursue higher education as well. 

Lastly, she is well rounded in every aspect. You name it, and she is good at it. She was in Allstate for choir, a record-setting varsity team member of her volleyball team (she is now a coach), a record setting cross-country runner, an artist, a builder, an activist, etc. 

I think the reason she was overlooked when she was younger was because she grew up in a small town (no one has ever been declared gifted at our small school).",0

"Korean dramas with gifted characters **Green Mother's Club** on Netflix

Mothers that compete in having the most successful child. 
The gifted child is central to the mother's storyline, but unfortunately not a big part of the storyline in the second half of the drama. You can see him have the typical problems of a gifted child; loneliness and pressure to perform.

It is a mini-TV-series with 16 episodes, a finished story. No more seasons. The style is makjang, which means that many (very) unrealistic things are happening, and all the people are dodgy and do questionable things. You can see the story as a vehicle to get personal development to happen, rather than look for realism. Do not get annoyed at for example the police interrogating people they know.

**Melancholia** on Viki

Mostly about school corruption, so it is a similar theme as to Green Mothers, but this time with older children. The lonely high school student that hated school, but got a teacher who understood him. Also a miniseries with no more seasons. The blurb on My dramalist is not really a good representation of the drama. Not quite as makjang as the *Green Mother's Club*. EDIT: Forgot to say that *Melancholia* talks about parallels between math and their life all the time. 

Lastly, if you want to see a gifted child in a variety program: **Return of the Superman** with Seungjae and his father, Go Ji Yong. If I link to the program, reddit will see this post as spam, so you have to find it yourself. For example ""Seungjae's linguistic skills that surprised everyone"". In the first episodes they are in the father talks about why they joined the program (because Seungjae had no friends).",0
"School is soul crushing I’m envious of those around me in school, how I feel like they're all idiots and can just accept mediocrity without questioning it, I don’t understand it even though I'm so jealous of it, and nobody seems to understand me. They try to include me in the community as they do everyone, but its become more clear to me that it doesn’t matter, nobody will understand even if they pretend they do. They’re all put in positions of mediocrity yet they don’t notice it, and don’t question it. It’s become glaringly obvious to me that for some god forsaken reason, I'm different, maybe I'm gifted or bright, everyone says I'm bright, maybe. I think I'm just stupid, that would make more sense, that this envy, anger and hatred is derived from my inability to correctly understand the situation I’m forced into. Or maybe its the ADD, maybe my adderall isn’t at a high enough dose, it makes me content, it makes me stop questioning things, I just wish I could live every hour of every day on it. Nothing here at school scratches my brain the same way say organic chemistry or pharmacology does, I wish I could just skip to college and do those topics my entire life instead of being trapped in this god forsaken hellhole, people already specialize for pretty much their entire life, why can’t I do so now. 

The medication is great and really helps with certain things but part of me hates that I need to be drugged so that I find school a tad bit less boring and soul crushing, I hate that the reason I got these meds were because I wanted to be able to adhere to how this system works only to realize it doesn’t really help with things I found boring in the first place. It annoys me that they can’t just push me off into college, it would get me out of their hair anyways, it would only benefit them. Or maybe if that happens I wouldn’t be smart enough, maybe I’m not bright, maybe I don’t have ADD, I could just be severely fucked in the head. It angers me that I’m the one that always needs to change and adapt to fit what they want me to do, why can’t they be the ones to change. 

Idk, I’ve been called bright and gifted by a lot of people. When I got diagnosed for ADD and took my meds, as soon as it started calming me down I thought that they all must have confused bright and gifted for ADD, I know the symptoms tend to overlap quite a bit. But once I found out that everything is still boring I didn’t really know what to think, it calms me down so I must have ADD, but I also have pretty much all the symptoms of giftedness (even though I really don't like saying that), of which they still appear when I'm on my meds. 

The combination of school being incredibly boring and me not being able to do the work causing me to become incredibly behind makes me feel like I’m just incompetent and an idiot.  


Note: sry for the long rant. It might meander a bit, was rather hard to put into words. Also sry if this doesn't fit in the gifted sub, I was debating either ADD or gifted and I personally felt it fit gifted more.  
Also I would kinda like some advice or support if anyone has any, couldn't put those two flairs on the post.",0
"Any gifted college drop outs? While I have always succeeded in my academics, university has become my greatest enemy. The work load, the teaching methods (or lack there of), and the content is just torture. I want to explore my passions and make a living doing something I love.

Do you guys believe there should be different measures in place for different levels of giftedness? I have read that the difference between a 145IQ and a 130IQ is greater than the difference between a 130IQ and a 115 IQ. Wouldn’t this imply that those who are 145+ require something more than just the average gifted program which caters mostly to those in the 130-135 IQ range. Are those with 145+ IQ’s kind of forgotten about because they are so rare? Thoughts?,0
"Should I get a second opinion? (Sorry for anyone who has seen my posts before, this is just something important to me and my psychiatrist, and it's also an incredibly frustrating situation) 

So the situation is a bit long, complicated and frustrating but this is pretty much it: I went to a psychiatrist with the suspicion of ADHD, the psychiatrist thought it might be giftedness with maybe a comorbidity with ASD/ADHD, I was referred for a neuropsych eval, the neuropsychologist gave the report and it didn't mention giftedness only ASD, I asked my dad to ask her why my profile doesn't fit with giftedness according to her and she said (translated text ahead as it comes from a message) ""For giftedness she would've had a higher percentile in all areas, and she shows a lot of literalness and impulsiveness, developed vocabulary, which is not characteristic of ADD, even more when she chooses a topic, she explores it relentlessly"" I know I'm untrained, that I'm a teenager and that she's still the professional, but... Talking only about results, that's not actually what it means to be gifted, is it? From what I know giftedness comes in a lot of different profiles, some are deficient in specific areas but have a lot of potential in others, am I just wrong? If yes, could someone explain why, please?

Its as if there is a impenetrable psychological wall preventing me from doing tasks or any forms of work by myself without advanced external intervention, I know I have very high potential that can get me far in life, but I have zero will power use them. Can I not have what I want? Is there something I need to do to repair my broken mind? I don't know what it is and therapy has not been helping.

"Yet another ""Am I Gifted?"" Post Hello, 

I hope you guys appreciated my little bit of humor in the title, but I'll just cut straight to the facts: 

I'm a male in my late twenties who is currently struggling to find myself and what's truly important in my life. I've been going through an incredibly emotional and confusing time the past few months and it has really taken a toll on my mental health. In addition, I'm seeing a new therapist for the first time later this week and I'm scared.

I've only ever had 2 therapists in my entire life: a terrible psychiatrist, who also happened to be a therapist, I saw when I drew disturbing pictures in high school, and an EMDR therapist who helped me work through a couple of specific trauma incidents. Besides the incident in high school, my mother never believed that I needed therapy and even continues to this very day denies the fact that I need therapy. She simply believes I just need either an increase dosage or a new medication to solve all my problems. 

Growing up, I never really had too much trouble in the world of academics or career wise. I graduated top 10% of my class at university and am currently in an MBA program through the college I work for. I work in Admissions for a university and receive a tuition benefit, so I am essentially going for my MBA for free. 

Pretty much all of my troubles have been behavioral wise. Again, my mother never believed this was an issue since I did fine academically. I had a bad tendency to get into arguments, fights, and general disruptions throughout school which landed me in detention a lot (I even had my bag searched for weapons because I told a kid I was going to ""slit his f-ing throat"" if he didn't stop being annoying). I never had any weapons and none of these incidents never amounted to anything, but it really made my school life growing up miserable and to this day, I only speak to 2 people I went to high school with. I think that I'm good at fitting in to some degree since because it's a survival mechanism for me. I definitely have lukewarm friendships and a group of people I get along well with at work, but I still feel very disconnected or only partially connected to most people. Except for a Discord I rarely use, I'm not on any social media platforms. I personally think they're all a waste of time for me. As someone who is working a full-time job, a part-time job, and is an a MBA program full-time, I can't really afford to waste any time on social media (Plus, I don't trust anything nor do I relate to most things people post about anyway). I don't watch Netflix or any television (Baseball and Football games occasionally), movies, or video games (I used to, but I no longer have time). I don't bother having a smart phone as I see that as a waste of time as well, and I generally have a very bleak view of the US and the future of our world because it feels like everyone has given up, in my eyes (Which also contributes heavily to the feelings of disconnectedness). 

I honestly don't want to feel this way, but it's very difficult when I feel like I'm putting in a lot of effort to keep my life on track and to offer something to the world and it feels like everyone else is holding me back. Even when I ask for help, everyone seems to just brush me off as to them, I know what I'm doing and I don't need any support. This is precisely why I am scared to death about seeing this new therapist this week. I'm so tired of people brushing me off and I keep replaying scenarios in my head where in the best case, the therapist completely misunderstands me and in the worse case, completely invalidates all my feelings and despises me. In any scenario, it always just ends up with me leaving very upset or me being kicked out of therapy. My rational brain is telling me that this is highly unlikely, but apparently my emotions do not care because I am a nervous wreck.

Can anyone provide me with any insight of what they think of my situation? I'm really not sure of who I am, if I'm gifted, or what I should do. I do really want to go to this appointment, but I just don't know if my fear of the unknown outweighs the benefit of therapy, so to speak.

Thanks in advance!",0
"Am I actually gifted? I'm not sure what counts as gifted, and I see many people identified as gifted at a very early age. (I'm 13.)

I'd like some opinions (not going for a formal diagnosis here) on my supposed or not supposed giftedness.

&#x200B;

This is long, so bear with me.

I started at a tiny Montessori pre-school at age 2. I graduated from that pre-school at age 4. While there, I decided I wanted to read to my cousin when he was born. So yes, I learned to read at roughly age 3.5/4. I've also found videos of me reading/reciting addition and subtraction facts at that same age.

I then started pre-k at my local public elementary school (4, turning 5 in September). I remember being REALLY bored, and I came home crying about it being too easy a few times (a common occurrence in my life), but my parents had me stick with it.

Lo and behold, the next year, in kindergarten, I made it less than three weeks before my teacher wanted to move me up. (What a surprise!) So I moved up to 1st grade. I stayed at that school for the next two years, but all during second, I'd finish my work within a few minutes, to the point where I started bringing my own books to school to read. (the class library only had picture books, and I was already on Percy Jackson-sized books at age 6/7)

So my parents pulled me out and enrolled me in a public online charter. It was still pretty easy, but my mom supplemented it with outside work. In 5th, I chose a personalized curriculum, and the problem I had was that I could do all the work, even most of the high school stuff, so then it would dump me in 12th-grade work. Then I'd get frustrated since I couldn't figure out what was going on, so my teachers would reset it. Then the cycle would repeat, over and over again.

At the beginning of the next school year, my test scores were high enough that they had me take the end-of-year benchmarks. I passed them all with roughly 90% correct. So then they moved me to 7th. (yes, I was 10).

Fast-forward a few years, and I'm now going into 10th grade (I'll be 14 in a few months). I took the ACT in April (as a 9th grader), and got a 32. (perfect score in reading, 8/12 in writing). I'm already planning to start APs and dual enrollment classes.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my novel haha. I also somewhat have the classic obsessions. I'll get really into something for a few weeks or months, and I just keep all that knowledge. My reoccurring obsessions are architecture, writing (started a novel, have 25,000+ words now), college searching (ik I'm weird), personality tests/astrology, and gymnastics code/judging.

All my friends call me the smart, responsible one, and I've always been the teacher's favorite. So I just kinda want to know how other people's experiences compare, and if anyone thinks I'm actually considered gifted?",0
"Looking for Friends (yes you) Hi friends in the making,

Connection and relatability are more difficult for us, so here's my shot at that! I'm not actually sure if I'm gifted but I seem to have a sizable chunk of the characteristics and suffer from the same issues(mainly loneliness). 

Anyways, I'm an undergrad from the US, and am interested in making friends around philosophy, engineering, music, travelling, charity work, and photography. Figuring out how to best live my life has become my recent obsession, in context of normative ethics systems, daily life, psychology, values, states of consciousness, etc. I'm working on a wave power idea as well, and anything that involves inventing and mechanisms is entertaining to me. Tried to improve flywheels and draw up some sort of hypothetical thermal battery but those were disastrous lol. I mostly listen to 1990s indie rock/shoegaze and dg but would love to hear some new tunes, and the other interests are fun cultural exchanges.

"Unique differences in thinking? I have quite a few differences in how I think that others do not appear to share. I have however heard of some other gifted people sharing similar experiences, such as thinking in abstract images. I find that it is a qualitative difference in thinking, but personally I haven't quite put my mind on a decision on whether it is beneficial to do this or not.   


For example, my use of language changes drastically when I think in abstract images instead of words. Example: ""My next descriptor runs obscure configurations that nonetheless exempla this process"". I find that I am using words I haven't really used before when I am thinking like this, that nonetheless do appear to fit when I really look back at them.   


As for the image in my head in the earlier case I had an image of a string of around 6 lights starting from one light line that looked as though it carried a mix of tune sheets and programming code, spinning clockwise, into a sort of sunlight appearing exit. To me it makes sense but obviously I don't think others would make sense of it.   


It might also be obvious from this that I can restrain my generation of these images. It kind of makes me stumped. I can do a bunch of things, and could develop these further, but I can also equally so not do them. Getting an idea of what is better, where and how is something I feel I really need. I just don't have anyone to discuss these things with. I have found thinking in abstract images gives the feeling of just really understanding mathematics or other text instantly, however I am equally so unsure on whether to trust this feeling or not, it could be bias from more associative images being present. There are so many other internal experiences and different ways of thinking I am internally aware of and can make use of, it's just so unguided. For the sake of this post I am sticking to getting an answer on abstract image thinking.   


Does anyone else think like this or in other unique ways? Any comments on such ways of thinking? Particularly downsides, strengths, improvements, differences, etc?",0
"Looking to know gifted people Long story short gifted condition has caused me to become somewhat misanthropic yet one of my hobbies is to get to know people from different backgrounds to see if I can find anybody that I can respect even slightly. Today its time for the ~~supposedly~~ gifted people from the internet. I tried the discord but they must be braindead if they think Im giving them my phone number lmao.

Send me a private message if u want to talk, I specially enjoy controversial topics since they make it easier to know the other person, but any topic is fine, really. Please, if you are the typical self-deprecating low self esteem dEpReSsEd *nihilistic* edgelord that uses intelligence as an excuse for their shortcomings dont bother. Mental health is definitely a thing but you know how it is sometimes. I guess this should serve as an introduction.

If ur 2 special for this u can also relate in the comments or just post the classic bullshit about how completely wrong I am about everything because you have had slightly different experiences. Either way its gonna be entertaining and it will give me a better understanding of this community, which is the whole point.

Not sure if I should tag this as rant, seeking support or discussion. I guess I wont tag it.",0
"Wisc-R high comprehension and coding. Is it aspergers? Hello, from what i remember i had really high comprehension and coding(17 and 19) part results from a wisc-r iq test that i had when i was a child. I have symptoms of Asperger's, can understand social cues but overthink too much and focus on one subject, i also have high anxiety.

However when i read the general Wisc-R test results of people with Aspergers i saw that they lacked heavily on comprehension and coding(from a few academic papers).

Now my question is do i still have aspergers? Do i have a very high functioning version of it? Is that why i had high coding and comprehension? Thanks in advance",0
"Can a neurotypical person have a slight difference in cognitive abilities? By neurotypical, I mean not gifted/ASD/ADHD. I know someone that is a top performer, that doesn’t imply that this person is gifted. But, i’ve noticed that this person has a great memory. And, this is seen with valedictorians etc. So can some valedictorians have a great working memory but pretty average other things? Like talking with some top performers, you can not but be sure that they are not gifted. They never questioned authority and they’re in university. That means a lot. One person lacks sympathy. I’m not saying they’re not smart. They actually are. But, at least they’re reasoning skills aren’t above average. Do you agree with me? They aren’t curious whatsoever. There are top performers that are curious and read lots of books and are high on sympathy. And, I am sure they’re above-average. But, some to me seem to just have a great memory.",0
"I need advice about emotional jams I'm a very joyfull and playfull person, childish ones could say. I can really feel almost spiritual emotions when I'm in the middle of a forest or countryside, admiring the beautiful and clever complexity of the puzzle of lives and laws that surrounds me. I can sense a supreme intelligence, beauty and love within everything including myself and my awareness and the huge emotions that I'm feeling in that moment. I think this supreme is God, because it feels like this.

Art makes me feel the same: it hits me and makes my bonds shiver in thrill, it brings tears to my eyes and relieve my soul... and yet my emotional potential is blocked and it hurts too much. I can sense I have a land of powerfull fire inside, a sun awaiting under the surface of a frozen lake... is scary somehow, but it's me and I want to set me free. Loads of bad experiences buried my heart into the soil, they built a dyke that is going to explote in the worst way.

I know the strenght of my emotions is wild: it feels like a violent force of nature (well, probably it is), a part of me wants to hide it because I feel this intensity can tear me apart or make me lose sanity. But I want to open the dyke's door to heal myself, to can really enjoy who I am before I die. The thing is no matter how much I try, I can't connect with it, I can't really open my heart to myself. 

Sometimes I'm very happy and in touch with myself, but as soonly as deep anxiety strikes I become amnesic-like about all the efforts I made and the stress numbs me horribly. I had fall countless times into the narrow dark well of numbness and sorrow, and I'm starting to be truly exhausted. I know my sould is strong enough to overcome these handicaps, but at times I forget about it for so long time.

I know the most of us must deal with this hell somewhen in our lives, that's why I wanted to know how you guys achievered to free and heal yourselves. What do you do to can open your heart and let your emotions out?",0
"Correlation between intelligence and altruism? I have no data to back this up, but concerning the state of the world, esp that of the US where I reside, it is hard to ignore the malevolence that seems perpetually awash in nearly every factor of our everyday lives. 

Personally, I've seen through experience that there seems to be a negative correlation between intelligence and generosity/kindness, that I'll label altruism here for the sake of defining it to one specific characteristic. 

Does anyone with a psychology, sociology, or other related background have any input on this theory?

I'm always looking for patterns, some way to help make sense of the world around me.

Edit: As many of you have pointed out, it's a positive correlation not negative. Thank you for correcting that, thats what I get for writing this at 2am :)

What I meant was I didn't want to make the assumption that simply bc one is smarter they are more generous, that seemed like quite a leap. But maybe some of you could verify that after all, and you have. 

But it seems to me that with the decline of intelligence, there is definitely a decline of generosity, and that is what I wanted to highlight.",0

"Describe yourself in love? Or just generally in a relationship? When I actually care about someone it’s like there’s a beast that’s coming out of me that wants to do everything to show that person how much they mean to me.

It’s almost like they don’t understand my passion and just call me “intense”.

"What is/are your framework(s) through which you view reality? In response to the confusion in the comments, I'm being more precise.

By framework, I mean a system that consists of the following things:

1. A set of assumptions about reality.
2. A set of inference rules.

The first covers the ontology, and the second covers the epistemology.

You needn't believe those assumptions and inference rules to be absolutely true or self-evident, but you must believe in them, otherwise, they aren't assumptions. The degree of which you believe in any given assumption will differ, and as such, this set could be divided into a subset of axioms you find self-evident, and a subset of assumptions you believe in but do not find self-evident.

These assumptions and axioms, and the inference rules, can be further split up into those that you are aware of, and those that you aren't.

You may then have a meta-framework. This puts the aforementioned framework and its contents into context. So, those assumptions that you believe in... do you believe that they're absolutely true? These are the questions your meta-framework answers.

**Example:**

John's framework is deductivo-empiricism, but he maintains the possibility that it might all be false, although such a possibility is ineffible to him. This is because he knows he may not ever absolutely know anything. As such, his meta-framework is pure agnosticism.

\_\_\_\_

You might be wondering how this relates to what I said about a framework being the system that ascribes meaning to experiences. See those comments if you haven't already, as they'll be helpful in understanding this part of the explanation.

So, experiences exist in one's sentience, and is observed by the consciousness. The sentient aspect is, with my definition of *meaning*, meaningless. It is just pure qualia. The conscious aspect consists of an identification and a contextualization; these processes are the consciousness making sense of the sentient aspect; it understands it as something in it of itself (identification, giving it its intra-essence) and something within everything else (contextualization, giving it its inter-essence).

And here's the relation with the aforementioned: the identification creates an assumption, and the contextualization either creates (an) assumption(s) and/or follows from the assumptions.

That's why I said your framework ascribes meaning to experiences. For every experience you've had, there's an assumption as to its identity, and there's either assumptions about that experience's place in reality, and/or its place in reality is derived from the other assumptions in your framework, that derivation following your inference rules.",0
"Is giftedness real/clinical? I'm in my late 20s. I recently became aware of ""giftedness"" through the Healthgamer Youtube channel. He basically described my entire experience growing up better than I ever could before. It felt like someone finally understood me for once, but to a scary degree. He described my thoughts and feelings. Parroted things people have told me repeatedly throughout my life. It even felt like it gave some sense to the things I do that others around me have always found strange. 

I delved in a little deeper. Now I find myself really excited to find out more about my own mind. I've done a lot of therapy and have been through a lot to get to where I am, but I still have always felt out of place in this world. However, I've been manipulated and burned  a lot. I grew up in the Christian church, and it took all of my being to rip myself from its claws. So now, while I'm a fairly open minded, I'm also a highly skeptical person. 

I haven't delved in too deeply, because I know I can get lost in it. But on a surface level google search, I couldn't seem to find anything concrete/clinically accepted by the mental health community. 

**So my question is** Is ""giftedness"" real? Or is it a theory that happens to identify broadly with a specific personality type?

Hello guys!
I’m no where gifted but i’m neurodivergent.

So, i was wondering what high-level programming needs? Like what kind of capabilities exactly?
Math and electrical engineering come naturally to me. I can directly apply and there isn’t a mess. But, when it comes to programming in python,
Sometimes I understand the problem differently and i solve a different problem and i always find a solution but it’s too complicated to put into code. Why does it not come naturally to me? Is it because it needs a big chunk of working memory? I felt that i as go forward i need a lot of what was learned before not in a conceptual sense but in an applied sense. But, how much reasoning does it need? Some people struggle with mathematics but seem to always score pretty high in programming exams. Does programming come naturally to some people? Does it need a simplified way of thinking? I always complicate solutions so it’s not pretty easy to put my thoughts into code. I put it and then Crash!

"Testing for 4 year old My son is 4 and will be turning 5 in a few months. I’m not sure if he’s gifted or just advanced for his age. 

He was able to read sight words before he 2 and books on his own before he was 3. He devours books and when given new books or at the library, he will sit and read for hours. He’s probably read over 300 books in the last 4 months. He has an amazing memory and vocabulary. He learned all the countries in the world and all 50 states when he was almost 4. He learned the names of over 50 dinosaurs and all sorts of facts about them. He knows more about space than most adults. He’s been able to do 40+ piece puzzles on his own since he was 2. He’s always been able to focus on something he finds interesting for long periods of time (e.g. reading an encyclopedia for over an hour) even at a very young age. 

As we begin to look for schools for Kindergarten and beyond, does anyone have any advice as to what to look for? Would having him tested be beneficial in any way? Is he too young? Who would do the testing? 

I would greatly appreciate any advice or tips. I just feel lost on how to support him, especially when it comes to figuring out the best school environment.",0

"The Curse of Being/Feeling Different The more I go on, and time passes by (by simply living my daily life for every single day it takes for it) I seem to be getting more and more easily the feeling of being misunderstood; of being not part of the ecosystem; of not being driven by something; or as much as the previous ones, of getting more mad day by day, year by year.


So, short life story:

(Now I'm 19)
I've always been afraid of being truly alone. Tho if I get it right, it has always been a part of me.
Metacognition (or simply put mental awareness) was a big part in the process of identification of my true (to the uppermost extent possible) self and in the process of development of my personality as of right now.
I've always been thinking about the fact that I was thinking upon a specific thought of a given topic. I've also been always surrounded by this strange feeling, of feeling an outsider, an alien: from one perspective it was because of a strange attention to a sort of ""field of view"" I still experience to this day in the way I describe it now or even in the way I lived it throughout childhood. This field of view I can explain as it being the space bounded by your eyes' limits through which you see the world; from the other perspective it was the mere thought of a typical solipsistic person: are the others real or are them the only projection of my thinking experience? Does this apply to everything else? Saying this 'cause I most often seem to fall back onto this thought process in peculiar, and it is debilitating...
Though the presence of some advanced traits of metacognition/mental awareness were there almost since from the start of it all (for me), I had know by the time I had gone through the death of my father, that something was missing, or oddly put in there.
My body was a mass of flesh, and all I was going through was the happening of some exterior forces to which I happened (and still happen to) to have no power of definition (of the events themselves).
Having been diagnosed with depression, and suddenly having had to start my medications journey - as for battling depression and similar issues themselves - have surely not helped me make me make contact with reality, 'cause I had by then become officially a ""mentally ill"" man, through which, in other ways - unexpectedly! - seemed to resonate the most!

Brief environmental description: born and still living in the center of Italy, I began my journey through life in this family of mine, which has obviously had a major role in the decision process of my most intimate traits of my own self - I am currently talking in the stage of life in which you are no more than a kid, innocent, a curious wonderer, and a nature and relationship seeker. So as for what happens in your life it surely does not fall under the obligation of being your fault. Whatever fault can mean. Here in Italy they say a small thingy to which in part I can address ""fault has been created by priests"" (since my home country is the home itself of Catholicism and my dear family and related known persons are highly religious).
Having to live with the fear of constant judjement because you hear your old ones taking care of their social status (if even they were any major or famous/notorious folks!) obsessively, and living under the denial of letting you escape your indoor reality to take a deep and MUST-TAKE breath of fresh air to make you just a little, play with possible future friends (by the age of 5 it became very difficult for me just on my own). This in exchange of lost in interest for the outside world, and a disgusting incapacity to relate to others in real terms of real life things-events, to the point of not making it out alive - if it was for me - to live without a starting point (of advantage) such as being economically stable-almost at the very least or having the fundamental traits of a charismatic person ready for all. And such.

I fear everything of this world. After my father's death (happening the 27th of December of 2016) I began slowly but surely, to not being able to express myself with all my needs and virtues - with something to offer on my own too maybe - and I suddenly felt down the abyss of existentialism, dropping all that have been left aside for me as a child in constant true-non-development, including moral values, ability to express, to feel happy, and to feel loved and love the others...
I am - to this day - still, a lost human.
No. I've come to the point in which I have dehumanised me, and am unable to seek or view possibilities of escaping this dark pit of despair in which I'm in. From time to time I experience mental breakdowns, which seem to make me progress through life-scenarios in worse than ever considitions... And I can't hide that I often think about suicide, not to make the others feel sad, but just for making it all vanished, hoping that somehow they'll be better (my family) even without me.
It has become a recurrent thought the one of suicide and not-strangely-enough, I don't view it as an anomaly. Tho I wished I were better...

I'm a 124-IQ brain on the spectrum of intelligence, and have been diagnosed a while ago with a lesser form of delusional psychosis.

There's still plenty to talk about but I feel like I've already said so much... Hope it is any useful (doubt it)...
Take care everybody!!

"I'm confused about my giftedness So about half a year after my primary school enrollment my teachers found that I was quite ahead of the other students my age and in turn I got an IQ test. The result pretty clearly said that I was gifted and therefore I got another half a year special tasks to foster my intelligence. Due to a lack of staff the program was cancelled and I never got further fostering neither in primary school nor in secondary (german equivalent to middle and high school). 

But still I was treated by the teachers and other students as highly intelligent. I never had to learn really which is a skill I lack now. People appreciated my for being so good at thinking and all the other stuff which got a pretty big part of my identity.

Fast forward: about a week ago another IQ test was presented to me which was a part of my ADHD testing. The thing: the result is in no way bad but technically I clearly can't be considered gifted now and that got me thinking. 

What happened to my intelligence and why did no one even myself noticed the decline?",0
"On My Giftedness, Learning Disabilities, Disappointment and Adulthood. I just want to share my journey in education after finding this subreddit. I hope some of you might read to the end. (Using throwaway fort this)

At five years old I was sent for IQ testing to the local university, as my Kindergarten teacher found me impulsive and disruptive. She truly believed I suffered from a degree of mental retardation. My parents found this very amusing, but I was tested, nonetheless. This was in the 1999-2000 school year. My Kindergarten teacher only taught that one year and then her contract was terminated. As it turned out, my IQ maxed out at 142. However, a battery of tests also revealed my development was uneven, and I was also severely dyslexic, ADD and learning disabled. I was told later that this put me on the autism spectrum, although I have never qualified for a diagnosis of autism proper. My parents were told I would never learn to read or write.

I am very fortunate that I was born into a loving middle-class family. My parents did not accept that and sent me to a speech and language pathologist who I saw several days a week after school. I don't remember not knowing how to read or having an a-ha! moment where everything clicked. I do remember activities I did to achieve this, but little else. By the third grade it was apparent I was somehow ahead of my peers in both writing, reading and science. I ceased seeing the pathologist in the fourth grade, but I will always be grateful to my parents and that women who gave me a future. At my school they started sending gifted children to a separate classroom for one hour a day to study more complex topics than were taught in our regular class environment. Mostly philosophy and mythology. To this day, 3 of the people I met there in that little room off the library in the fourth grade, are among my closest friends who I consider family, who I still regularly see to this day, even though we live in different places.

In middle and high school, they simply had gifted English/Writing classes. In regular classes and honors classes things were okay, but just okay. It was in high school though, that I noticed my gifted classes and AP classes were the only ones I felt comfortable and understood in. There weren't too many of us, and we became very close. I still speak with many of them today.

I realized at some point that I did this thing where I modified the way I speak and the things I speak about depending on whether or not I was talking to a ""gifted"" person or not and I still do something this. When I am myself and say what's on my mind, sometimes people stare at me like if I'm some alien. I thought this meant I was just an a\*\*hole except that my closest friends who were likewise gifted said they did the same. It is an unconscious thing now, It doesn't work like ""*well, I better talk stupid to these peasants*"" but more like ""*if I want people to like me and not want to punch me in the face, I better modulate what I say and how I say it*"".

Giftedness for me was a double-edged sword because it came with learning disabilities. I have always been weaker in math but an army of tutors helped me do well in those classes in school. I am one of those people who sometimes does not get it the way it is initially explained, but once I do get it, I master it.

I did not have the normal college experience that was expected of me. By my senior year of high school, I was going to and throwing a lot of parties and my friends and I drank heavily to help with the extreme anxiety I'd developed. I stopped putting effort into subjects I wasn't interested in and my grades suffered for it. By the time I graduated, I was bound for community college unlike my other gifted friends, who were offered scholarships to universities. The funny thing was, I wrote the admittance essays for two of these friends.

The drinking, partying and the anxiety followed me though. At community college, I did not go to class and I felt like everyone around me was an idiot. Really, it was me that was arrogant, most of these people worked hard and studied and went on to finish their degrees at universities. I dropped out and worked for the government doing secretarial work for years, but I was deeply unhappy during those years. I became extremely depressed and more anxious than ever and used my hyperfixations, common to those of us with ADD, to get by. I would sometimes try to go back to school, but found it hard because I had changed, I did not have the company of my closest friends who had flourished at university and my motivation had become so low. I felt hopeless. I perpetuated this cycle of working and quitting, trying to go back, quitting that, over and over again until I was 25 and suddenly, I realized I was old. This thought came from the ageism I had developed, though I now understand that aging is a gift not all of us who are born are lucky enough to experience.

In 2020, I decided to go back to school part time, one last time, to give everything I had. Then, the funniest thing happened that Spring. I lost my job like many did during those months, and I found myself having to move back in with my parents at age 25. My college switched to online only classes for a year and a half, and knowing myself and my weakness, I did not enroll in online classes because I felt I would be setting myself up for failure. Summer 2021 rolled around and in person classes began to be offered again and I enrolled then. I made a pact with myself that this was the end of the line, I could not go on like this and that school had to come before everything. So I went to every class, always on time, no more distractions. Studying and papers went first before any other thing. And finally, I did well. I made straight A's. I did it again this Spring and intend to do so again this Fall. I will be able to transfer to university at last and start there in Spring 2023.

I despise living off the generosity of my parents, but they insist that I should save my money for grad school and move out then. I still struggle with feelings of shame that my path has not been linear and that I caused grief to those who had high hopes for me. I am now 27 and I'm never going to be a doctor like they hoped, but if the world holds on and I work hard I will be a librarian and archivist, because that will make ME happy.

Giftedness was not a gift to me in the way I hoped it would be when I learned what it meant. It has made me isolated from avenues of camaraderie that might otherwise be open to me if I thought more in the way most people do. It gave me expectations of myself that I was doomed not to meet. Of the friends I still hold dear, none of them has had an even ride, even if they succeeded at university. One has depression and such a severe eating disorder, that I will be surprised should she live to see 35. One, though to someone like me a master of numbers, cannot pass her CPA exam because of her anxiety and is on the verge of declaring bankruptcy herself. The other is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic who is also trying to renter education. They all have serious relationship problems and always have. And all my friends who were not in the gifted program with me are happy. They have finished graduate school, they are getting engaged, buying houses, and starting families. I have to imagine this just how the cards were dealt, but I still find it a little ironic.

I have wondered if it is simply that we four were a group of miscreants within the gifted program growing up. But then I have heard from a few others over the years who were in it, some so successful on the surface, others not. I know my experience is not universal. Many people tested gifted and that was that. They have lived their lives with no disruption, able to communicate easily with all they meet and succeed at all they do, but this experience was not mine. For the younger among you, that does not mean it will be yours. But I might impart a word of advice if you have yet to figure it out: never tell anyone who does not ask that you are gifted or inform them what it means, it does not usually go well. IQ means nothing in the real world if you don’t have other tools at your disposal, whether they be mental health or support system related. It is easy for people like us to get lost in ourselves and allies are important for those of you who think and feel deeply.

You might think my story useless or believe that since I struggled, I never belonged in gifted, but if anyone out there can relate or learn something from this, then I will consider it a good thing.",0
"I'm going through some mental ""crisis"" and need some thoughts and pointers  

Okay so I wanna start by saying this is gonna be a huge rant and list of mental symptoms and behaviors that I've always been biased about and have started to kinda of concern me. Some affect my daily life, while others don't are are just ""because I do this does it mean I have that"" type things.

I know I need some sort of mental help but I don't know what kind. I don't know where to start, what to look for, and to be honest I just don't have the mental stamina to go alone and trial and error all of this, let alone all the money it'll cost.

Maybe someone that reads this has some knowledge on what I say, maybe someone has personals experience. I don't know. But im looking for opinions and pointers to the right direction.

But yeah, its basically gonna be a scattered list of notes from here on.

I have super bad anxiety. My entire life I would obsess and fear over bodily health, mental health, and others peoples health.

Im a hypochondriac, I am too sensitive to what happens to my body, I panic if I don't have a direct answer to why I am feeling what I feel. I hyper analyze my mental and physical state to make sure everything is ""up to code"" and if its not I need a rationalize logical reason or I panic thinking im sick and dying.

I chase adrenaline but then I suffer from it. I love scary stories, fear excites me. But then it causes panic. For example, I love creepy pastas, horror stories, ghost sightings, and scary explorations during the day, but at night it hits back. I cant sleep, all I can think about is dragging back some kinda attachments or ghosts and panic all night.

I get very obsessed with things very quickly but usually drop them after a couple weeks and sometimes it re sparks.

I got obsessed with learning the guitar every summer for 3 years and completely drop it 2-4 weeks in. I watch videos, I read, I spend money on maintaining and upgrading, and I genuinely do practice, but in a few weeks it just dies out.

I randomly with obsessed with pens. My explanation is that they're cheap and theres almost an endless amount of options to choose from so whenever Im bored I can drop like 30-50 bucks on a handful of pens and just test the out see which ones I like and dabble around for a few hours.

I've had similar obsessions with skateboarding, hoodies, long sleeve shirts, jeans, caps, shoes, sticky notes, mechanical pencils, journals, gaming mice, mouse pads, alcohol, video games, books, headphones, keyboards, music making, film making, recording and editing software, bikes, camping, hiking, swimming, going to the gym, songs.

Basically anything that has options and variations, I feel like I need to compare all possible options and test them and pick out the very best one.

It also happens with shows and movies. If the show clicks with me I'll develop rushes on the characters, real or fiction, I'll become obsessed with the world and story and lore.

Happens with real life people too. I develop these super intense crushes on people I literally barely even know and just obsess and think ONLY about them from like a couple weeks to a couple months.

Sometimes they're sexual/romantic other times they aren't. I had a huge Johnny Knoxville phase. Im not gay I just thought the dude was so incredibly cool and all could do was research and watch all his content for a while.

As much as it happens with mostly positive things it also happens with bad things. I obsess over little symptoms I have, headaches, dizziness. I sometimes focus only on my weight and worry when it fluctuates thought the day. I've focused on my body temp and just been measuring it all day for weeks. I've focused and panicked over m heart rate for a month. I focus over my mental health and mental illness. It always comes and goes in waves like every other month I'll just remember all my quirks and start googling and then get all biased with my quirks and actual symptoms. I feel like Im constantly monitoring and checking and testing my physical and mental sensations and quirks.

I fidget a lot. I dont know if its stimming or what but I walk around the house when im bored and restless. Kinda pace since there isn't much room to walk. I dont know if its the repetition of pacing that feels nice or if its just the movement that feels nice. I sometimes clap out of boredom, I whistle and hum, I jump and bob around my chair. I fidget with my fingers or little Knick knacks. I wiggle my legs/ feet/ fingers. I sometimes make sounds or noises when Im bored or when im like concentrating and enjoying myself.

The dark always disorients me super bad. I think its something about not being able to see my surroundings, but the dark disorients everything and makes me panic.

My eyes sometimes like just get tired or something and do this weird thing where they get sensitive to light or something? Like it usual happens when im reading white words on a black background. My eyes just do this weird thing where they feel like more sensitive or something.

I struggle with eye contact. Its not too bad when Im listening but when Im talking its hard to look at someone's eyes while thinking of what I have to say without losing track. I think its because i know they're looking at me so there's extra pressure to not mess up and when I do mess up I know they are judging me.

I pay attention to peoples mouth a lot, probably more than their eyes. Again maybe Im being biased because I read about this being an autism symptom and Im scared of having it but mouths are really interesting to watch for some reason. The lips, the chin area, the teeth, theres a lot of variation and detail. But a lot of the time peoples eyes are kinda boring and just too static. Some people have nice pretty eyes and nice eyelids and eyebrows that are interesting to watch but yeah. mouths are more dynamic.

I was always shy and awkward. I struggle talking to people because m mind goes blank and im too worried about how they see me and what they think of me.

Again might be biased because I read about ""masking"" but when Im at my truest self I am very loud and expressive and quirky. I might come off as dumb because I act before I think. I stutter, I stumble, I say dumb things, I over react, I over exaggerate. If anyone's watched the streamer XQC Im kinda like that when I feel at my best.

But when im out in public I become a shell because I know its overbearing and too much and too weird so I try to like be ""normal"" I guess by muffling myself and being calm. It still stresses me out because Im so worried about making a good impression. But I cant because Im too nervous.

When I was younger I'd need to warm up to people first. Like Id be all shy and quiet but after a few mins I would pop out of my shell and be all happy go lucky. but now as an adult its just sad.

I need time to prepare myself to social events. Even if its with close friends. I dont know why but I feel nervous when meeting good close friends. I guess part of me still thinks they'll judge me or maybe like Im faking my happiness/energy and Im not really lkie that in real life? Maybe I expect them to expect me to be at 100% all the time and if im not I feel like I let them down?

I thought maybe im an introvert but I still really like being around people. I like noisy busy environments and I like crowds. I dont really like interacting with them, but I like being part of them. I dont like being alone because it drains me and usually makes me sleepy or regress to negative internal thoughts and feelings.

I had a big fear of being left alone. I couldn't go to school alone (not sure how long but maybe to like 1st grade?) and would freak out if I didn't see her at the store, I also couldn't sleep alone at night for years.

I sometimes get what I think is sensory overload where im suddenly just like more aware of everything around me. This ""filter"" randomly wears off and everything is more open and im more aware. It doesn't cause me to freak out but its just a bit jarring and weird. This happens a lot when its dark because I lose my orientation of whats around me.

Fluorescent lights are annoying to me. Again not sure if this might be normal but I really dont like them and its shocking to me why they're so popular. Like They don't make me run away screaming but they make everything feel so un home-y and so sterile and hospital-y. Why would you want that.

I write down way too much. Its like a fear of forgetting something important or something so im always writing tons of thoughts and ideas down. I have journals, sticky notes, phone memos, word docs, google docs, just filled and scattered all over my room.

I write down bad thoughts to keep them out of my head, I write down symptoms to keep track of them, I write down nostalgias to not forget them, I write down goals and general wants.

I have bad intrusive thoughts that cause me huge destress and directly impact some decisions I make in real life. Like if I think something bad on a piece of food I have to throw it away so I dont get sick or something.

I am always chasing nostalgia and get super depressed because it never feels the same.

For some reason I've always thought there was something wrong with me physically or mentally. Im always searching and comparing and checking symptoms trying to find something. I dont even now if I have anything but I keep searching.

My parents and teachers always said I was fidgety and jumpy as if I was running on a motor, and my parents always threatened me will calming pills but never did anything about it. I was always good about getting my school work done but I kinda hit a wall in 11th grade. Everything just got super boring and I couldn't really keep up. Even in college shit was just boring or too complicated, Like chemistry, business, economics, and that were math psychology ""if this then that"" crap. Too many numbers and rules.

Right now im struggling because im only focusing on bad mental and physical symptoms. On one hand I understand that MOST of what I feel is cause due to mental stress but I still cant stop obsessing over them.

I also struggle to start things. I have so many plans and ideas but its almost impossible to push myself. The only motivation I get are there random manic like bursts that last maybe like an hour but then I lose all interest again.

I also have weird mood shifts. One moment im manic, feeling good and energized, the next im kinda sad, fatigued, weak, and bored.

damn this got long. Im tired. I literally sat here for like an hour just thinking and writing. If anyone's made this far props to you!

if anyone has questions or wants me to add something more I will be happy to. I know there's so much more but I'm just done.

Thanks to anyone that comments their opinions or pointers!",0
"Being misunderstood socially? Does anyone else have a constant problem of people misunderstanding what they're saying?

It's like there's some social code on how to understand specific things, but it's different from the actual meaning of the words. So whenever I say something, like 'That shirt doesn't look great on you', people start thinking I mean something way worse for some reason. If I meant something way worse, I'd just fucking say what I meant. Anyone else have this issue, or have any idea how to fix it?",0

"Letting down your manipulative therapist So basically i went to therapy for the first time, and she immediately identified me as having ""arborescent thinking"" which was pretty much a euphemism for gifted. 

And then she immediately started saying things with uncommon words testing my vocabulary. I don't consume much media in french so i didn't get the meaning of what she said (making me feel bad), and when i called her out on her impromptu IQ test, she denied it.

Does she lack the self awareness to see what she was doing, or is she gaslighting me?",0
Is this relatable? Does any other gifted folks have so many ideas bouncing around in your head that you can’t focus? I was wondering if anyone can relate.,0
"Misunderstood. Being misunderstood is common for gifted individuals, so I hope some of you can relate to my experiences. 

About a week ago at work, I worked with my lead and the guy they're training to be lead. One of them had commented, ""you seem like a pretty intelligent guy,"" and they had already offered for us to get breakfast together like, say, friends. I figured, if we're going to be friends and they already think I am intelligent, perhaps I should open up about my giftedness. I attempted to explain it, and my lead said: ""I don't know what that means, but it sounds cool, so that is good, I guess."" I didn't even bother to explain anymore, and I'll likely never mention it again.

I also made a post on a question-based subreddit that asked, ""why are you still single?"" I offered a few things and then submitted my giftedness, explaining that my unique hobbies and interests make it hard to find a partner. I wouldn't say I like smoking, drinking, sports, going out, etc., but I enjoy particle physics, neuroscience, and psychology. I went on to state, ""I am not superior to anyone in any way, I am simply different, and this difference creates a life-long struggle to find a connection."" I received a reply stating that my post screamed of a typical college freshman. That I believed my intelligence made me superior and would remain that way until I got a real job or got further into a degree. Of course, many agree with him on this matter, but in reality, I do not think I am superior to anyone. 

I so badly want a deep and personal connection. I crave and yearn to be understood. If having lower intelligence enables me to find suitable partners more *easily*, then, by all means, take my intelligence away. I am not superior to anyone -- I am different.",0
"Does any one of you struggle to find meaningfulness? This struggle is overwhelming to me. What can I do ? Hi,

Sorry in advance for the following depressing vent but I just don't know to whom to ask this. Also, English isn't my mother tongue so I'll try to write the best I can.

I am having trouble to adjust to my very recent diagnosis of being gifted and ADHD. I mean in a 2ay it brought relief at first to finally know why I had struggle all my life to fit but it also down on me that there is no way to ""fix"" it and that the struggle will continue.

The problem is, I am exhausted to struggle. I am a 39yo woman who has work tirelessly since I was at school, I had no issues with academics but I didn't want to work too much on the boring stuff. I went to University, got my degrees, then I move abroad to start over, got a job in what I loved doing, I've been working in this field for 15 years now. I Still love what I am doing but I hate the way we do it. Globally. I hate the normative Monday-Friday 9-to-6 every week, all year long. It doesn't make sense to me.

I've been trying to fit for so long that I burnt out at 34. Took some time to heal, went back to worked, tried to do it differently by putting more boundaries but still here I am again at 39 and my second burn out.

This is went I got my diagnosis of ""twice exceptional"". Which apparently usually comes with a quest for meaning in what we do (said my therapist).

But I just feel stuck and empty. I am just tired to fight to manage to fit into society at the cost of my well being. Yet I have no idea how to listen to my own needs on that matter as I can't find any meaning 8n a lot of things.

For instance working. I am a hard worker, but the way we, as a society, work is utter nonsense to me. Being asked to work more for wages barely allowing us to be able to fulfill any life project we might have like having kids, traveling, having a house or start a business or just live off the grid or whatever that is.

I am at a point in my career where I have a very good salary, I budget and take car of my finances and still I find the cons of working the way we do overweights the pros. The cost in free time is too high. We could have used our technological progress to help us, human, to have more free time to live, but no, instead we are squeezed to the last drop then tossed aside and replaced by young lemons that only know they want to do lemonade without understanding it will cost them greatly.


I have always been a down-to-earth person that love to dream about a lot of stuff, I have to s of project ideas flying by constantly in my head but I don't find any meaning in the thought of making them becoming actual projects in real life.

I don't see the point, it seems small and just shallow. Another gadget, another way of entertainment, another ""thing"" that will be forgotten soon and just takes place for nothing. It doesn't help people or make our world better.

Then I think at activities and project to actually help people or trying to make the world better and even though I like the idea behind these thoughts, I can't help but to feel it is also meaningless because it would take so much than one person to actually make a difference even though one person is always better than none. 

I am lost, I am supposed to got back to work in a month, after a 6 months break to reflect about all of it but I don't even know if I can still do any work in any field given that I will still struggle to find a way to make ""their"" way work for me. I am looking at doing something else, something that matters to me, that has more meaning to me, and even though I am interested in so much topics , I cannot for the love of me find a single thing that brings meaning. I just don't know what to do.

What if I am broken and cannot work or do stuff anymore?
Why can I not find meaning is anything? Am I so arrogant that everything is beneath me ? Not big enough? Not meaningful enough? I've never been like that, I don't get me right now.

Did you struggle to find meaning because of your giftedness? If so what changes did you do ? How did you find what mattered the most and how to make it real ?

If you reach this point, I thank you for reaching me, this is really nice of you.",0
"OCD/ADHD and relation with giftedness? Hi everybody. I’m not a native english speaker so sorry for my bad english. I just wanted to ask a couple questions regarding my life. I’m a 23 y old guy with OCD. This disorder was very severe during childhood but, as I grew up, I started losing obsessions or caring about some of them and I would say that my biggest obsessions regard now studying (I cannot read a page and go to the next one without knowing practically every single word in that page. Apart from this, I have been told, especially in the last couple years (by friends and family) that I very often seem not to pay attention to what they are saying, keep on moving and cannot stand still. A friend suggested I could have ADHD, I searched for the symptoms and saw myself in almost every behaviour of people with ADHD. But, isnt it weird not to have been diagnosed till the age of 23? And can it have sth to do with giftedness? (Also for this, I wasn’t diagnosed by a psychologist, so dont know at all if i may be gifted. I passed the mensa entrance test and scored in the 130-140 interval in almost every online test I took (the ones with higher correlation with WAIS). So, apart from the questions I asked, do u think getting tested (WAIS or ADHD testing) may be useful or do u know other people (possibly gifted) in the same situation? Sorry for having been lenghty.

"Spatial ability is neglected As Lubinski and Kell (2013) found, spatial ability is a neglected field. Many talented individuals finish school and even college without recognizing their gift.

It was definitely the right move, because the positive effect is my overall happiness increased drastically. 
Trying not to write a wall of text

"Who are the happy, successful gifted people? Redditors have pointed out that this sub is kind of negative, and that gifted people here seem to dislike their giftedness.

So... who do you think the truly happy gifted people are? I think the happier gifted people are the ones who enjoy and do well in academia. I can do academia, but I hate it. I got to a point where I could no longer suppress my true interests anymore. I like seminars, and I like to take some continuing education classes, but I dont want to be in a 'real' school environment ever again. 

This may ruffle a few feathers, but I think gifted people who follow the standard, dare I say stereotypical path get more acceptance, support, and love. 

When people think of smart person, they see dorky spelling bee winner or Steve Urkel. They don't see Dolph Lundgren, who is basically a rocket scientist. When you step outside the box, it can cause a lot of problems. 

Many of my interests are nonacademic. Im very active, and I enjoy sports and being physically fit. I also tested as gifted in high school. I won't go into one of my rants, as anyone can look up my post history here of in r/aftergifted. Im in my 30s, and people still try to shove me into some little box. I don't like school anyway, but I dont see any way out but abject academic failure. I don't want to be smart if it's at the expense of everything else about me.

"Identity and purpose Everything around me seems so slow and frustrating. I can't understand how people can put up with 8h repetitive boring jobs or abusive conditions (dissociation I guess). To be honest I dont understand how they put up with any situation that lasts more than 5 minutes. I have a constant desire for purpose and stimulation, sometimes even wishing to stand up and run away, scream and destruct what's near me. 

Emotions are very intense, stress, anxiety and constant introspection. Often, it feels like time is slowed down, and in spite of this, sometimes I am so absorved in something that the passage of time becomes huge leaps of hours.

I have tactile hypersensitivity and feel uncomfortable every second of every hour of my day. I cannot focus on anything.

Neither can I work, specially not if the job is not fulfilling or has a purpose for me. Hypersensitivity and flat feet makes it really hard. Just imagining a full time job makes me wanna kill myself.

I hate society every day. I hate listening to tv, the need for words and predefined social standards, the shallowness, the unfairness and stupidity of everything. In the other hand, calmness is marvelous. 

To love and to feel, learn and think. My dream is to do something to help others or to make the world a better place, but also to find my comfort and joy. If I could connect with somebody and get rid of this loneliness I would be the happiest person. I also like instrumental music or music in general. Or sometimes just the sounds of the environment, feeling the wind, and contemplating my surroundings.

When I was a kid I loved documentaries and drawing was my passion, since it allowed me to imagine and observe, which I did very well. I had plenty of energy and curiosity, and wanted to change the world. There were no signs of social anxiety, addiction or any other issue that came afterwards. Unfortunately, my parents were abusive and I never connected with anyone.

I feel prisoner of my own body and society. The therapist believes I am autist but I am sure I am not. The doctor believes I am hypocondriac. Expressing myself and communicating is difficult for me.

I don't know the purpose of this thread, I guess it's just narcissism or the wish of being understood. You may think what does this all have to do with giftedness.

I'm interested in so much though, but I'm not sure where to start in learning new subjects and incorporating that knowledge into my life. I've been teaching myself college bio and algebra for some exams I'm taking in August, but I'm not sure how useful it is in actually retaining the knowledge and being able to utilize it to understand modern issues, or where I would even go from there to know more. Has anyone experienced this before or have any ideas?",0
"Giftedness and class perspectives I don’t know exactly where I’m going with this, I have three half thoughts in my head but I am hoping at the end that this will all make sense. 

I have in the past year become more aware that I am experiencing an inner conflict related to giftedness and class.
I grew up working class (relatively poor) but with access to books and culture, and the expectation that I would succeed academically (although I was more artistically inclined myself). This eventually let me to a place where the ideal of [bildung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildung) was held in high esteem. I received a good education but by this education I was also granted access  into a world where the expectations relating to culture and manners, and the ideas of what had value and not, were far removed from those of my upbringing. 

I have since found my way back to a more creative and grounded existence, but I carry with me some of the elements of the intellectual bourgeoisie that I value, and some that I don’t but have internalized. Basically trying to disentangle myself from the snobbishness of a certain societal strata. 

This might be a European thing, but I have the feeling that giftedness is linked to snobism. Some things are not “bon goût” (good taste). You’re not supposed to enjoy certain music/ books, dress a certain way etc. It’s taken me some time to realize that this is bullsh*t and I am proudly reclaiming whatever I like and also pride in my cultural and class background however it’s an ongoing project. I am also discovering that the classic European epistemology and methodology is not the be-all end-all I was educated to believe, and this is a great relief as it did not hold the space for my own cultural and ethnic background. 

Okay now I’ve gotten this far, I think I’ve managed to get most of my thinking into writing. So now I guess I am curious to know about your own journeys with regards to class and giftedness? Or any general thoughts on the subject? Is it possible to disentangle giftedness and education from a classist dimension, and if yes, what would that look like?",0
"Just found out I have an IQ of 150. Not sure how to feel about it. I'm keeping this anonymous because I don't want anyone to know who I am. I know some people might think I am fishing for compliments or something but believe me I get enough of those and I hate it. I'm also rational enough to know that compliments aren't what I would get by posting this. I really don't want this to come off as braggy; I just have a problem, and I don't know anyone who can genuinely relate to it.

In retrospect it makes sense. I had always assumed my IQ was around 125-130, and because I have a slew of mental disorders and was developmentally delayed it seemed to fit. I would always stand out in any situation for my ability to pick up and master anything I tried, and for the longest time I simply assumed it was because I was the only person that really tried at things. Now I realize that may not have been so true. I still struggle in school because I can't force my attention to something that isn't engaging. It's not that I don't care. My eyes glaze over and I can't read the words. I have struggled with stimulant medication my whole life and due to the side effects I am taking a dose that is an order of magnitude lower than what I took growing up. But I'm making my way through a math and physics double major. It is by no means easy for me, primarily because I chose to forgo the necessary medications, and as such I feel like I have to reread every part of a textbook dozens of times because I can't silence my internal dialogue while I read. Last semester I spent nearly all my time studying and repeatedly burned myself out to the point where I struggled to think clearly or read at all for 4 days leading up to my finals. I love reading about physics but that doesn't mean I'm not exceptionally slow when it comes to homework - but I digress. 

In recent years I have started to access my full potential in my interests. I haven't changed anything but I have been contacted by the local media for an artistic piece of hyperrealism, even though it was my 4th try drawing in that medium, and I never had that ability before. I assume it is because in art classes in school, time was the major constraint. I am an incredibly slow thinker, and slow to do pretty much everything in life. Now that I have the freedom to rigorously explore my surroundings, I find that the flow states I feel in my hobbies connect to each other and it makes learning completely new and abstract activities to be unreasonably simple. I never meant to excell so much in these areas. 

I am likely autistic and have uncontrollable hyperfixations that render me incapable of doing anything else until I finish a masterpiece in whatever it is I happen to be interested in at the time (masterpiece is subjective, I mean it as in I finish something to the extent that I personally don't think any part of it could be improved to my liking - its an obsessive need to completely and holistically realize that which I desire). Growing up I would build robots and watch space documentaries, but it feels like my learning curve in recent years has accelerated far, far beyond what I ever thought I was capable of. You'd think I would enjoy living like this, like it would feel like I am in a TV show. But all I feel is confusion.

I am so glad my parents hid my IQ from me and still provided me with the necessary materials to learn, and made sure I had close friends who were also incredibly gifted. It gave me a beautiful social network and allowed me to spread my wings. 

Don't get me wrong - I enjoy being smart and capable of pursuing any of my dreams, even with my severe executive limitations. But I don't feel smart. I'm not depressed about it either. For some reason I feel existentially scared. Scared that maybe I am just that unique. It would render me alone in the way I experience and process the world around me. I had been developing a concern for this in recent months and in searching for a psychiatrist I found a psych evaluation and confronted my parents about it. I get that I shouldn't feel any different but I do. What scares me is the statistic of my intelligence being 1/2500. 

I don't feel like I did anything to deserve this. And I'm angry that other people don't get to experience what it is like. I can't imagine not being able to see the things that I can see, to be able to just figure out how to solve a rubiks cube on my own or pick up photorealism in under 100 hours when it takes people decades. Why me? Why can't I live in a world where everyone around me is smarter, where I feel like everyone around me has wisdom to offer, where I'm not the one explaining concepts and ideas all the time, where all my interactions aren't just people feeling bad about themselves for not being able to do what I do. 

I am obsessed with philosophy and existentialism, the interrelation between temporality and conciousness, quantum field theory, gravity and cosmology, neuroscience and the essence of reality. And I look around and nobody else lives their lives like I do. I don't think I'm better than anyone else; my intelligence is undeserved and has nothing to do with who I am as a person. But I am secretly, and existentially terrified that other people simply are not capable of experiencing reality the same way I do. I am terrified that I am not capable of experiencing reality the way they do. I assume everyone has this problem though, at least to some extent.

I just want to know how I should feel about this. The past few months feel like I've been discovering that I'm genuinely gifted, that I have been given a gift that is not just rare but paired with my privelege in life, it doesn't seem real. My life now seems too special to be true and I am confused because I want to be normal and I don't want to be special. I just want to fit in and be on equal footing with my peers and to know that finding like minded people will forever be incredibly rare really, really scares me. If there is anyone else on here who has experience with this, please feel free to reach out.

I just hope I'm not wasting my potential. And I hope I can find some way to pay what I feel I owe back to the society around me. I don't want my intelligence to just be a series of party tricks that make people secretly feel bad about themselves.

I'm alright its just - everything suddenly feels so weird...",0
"Gifted struggles: dealing with lack of empathy in non-gifted people. So I’m not sure if this is related to my giftedness or not but it seems like I push many people away when they hear me voice my opinions or talk about life in general. I was even called “extreme” and crazy by people online and in real life. I also noticed that most people only have empathy when they or their family members experienced something. I feel like a college student being put in a room full of 1st graders. 

I feel like the average person is either dumb or cold and it makes me not wanna deal with anyone and it makes me feel frustrated and lonely and also resentful. I mean don’t get me wrong I’ve seen a handful of smart/high empathy people but I feel like there’s too little to make a difference. I see so many people being so chill and laidback about lots of twisted shit and it makes me feel like my high sensitivity is a curse. 

Ignorance is bliss for sure, I resent them for their ability to go about their day without letting things get to them, while things take a toll on my physical and mental health. What should I about this cognitive dissonance that I’m experiencing? I’m complaining about these people and wanting to be like them at the same time it just doesn’t make any sense. How do I come to terms with my sensitivity and how can I deal with the fact that I’m surrounded by aholes? Also I’d love to hear your story if anyone feels the same way as I do.",0

"Collapsed? Understimulated? ADHD? *I feel like I'm going in circles and it's driving me insane!*

I used to be able to do an insane amount of things in high school while keeping a 4.0, even in A.P. and college classes. I did all that, was in band, jazz band, theater, football, basketball, lifting, orchestra, I started and ran my own club and grew it to 182 members, I was a National Honors Society Officer, I did all of it, and then I crashed due to an ex girlfriend who convinced me I'm depressed, and I got on zoloft for a year, and haven't been able to do that much since. I'm currently 23,  didn't do more than a semester of college due to no money and horrible mental health, and I've been working but being burned out at the end of the day. But anyway, I think maybe it's ADHD because I did everything last minute in high school, my dad has it, and my closest friends have it.

&#x200B;

**Maybe I'm just a collapsed gifted adult:**

* I got tested as gifted in elementary school and kept a 4.0 until I got a B in 11th grade while taking college credit courses and dozens of extracurriculars and working multiple part time jobs
* I have an excellent working memory  (I can memorize most of a chapter before a test and ace a test)
* I can focus on things I'm interested in
* I have periods where I can force myself to do things I'm not interested in.
* I can understand really complex material quickly and teach it to somebody
* I can get obsessed about something for a few months and read like 300 books on it and then get bored of it and not bring it up anymore
* I could create really cool things with little preparation until after highschool
* I could pick up skills really quickly until after high school
* I'm a super patient person and can be calm
* I can respond to people really quickly and be witty most of the time while doing a lot

&#x200B;

**Maybe it's gifted + ADHD:**

* I get burned out at the end of the workday even though it's an easy job
* I spent 5 years trying to go to college but I can't figure out how to make the money work without being in a ton of debt
* I've been using caffeine to regulate my ability to pay attention to boring things, and to regulate my emotions
* I used to have this constant dialogue in my head of like 2-8  different streams of thought at once moving rapidly (until I learned how to slow it down with a book I read)
* I've always been terrible at time in general. I'm nearly always late STILL at 23.
* I usually feel the most peaceful when there's a lot going on around me or when it's chaotic and I need to solve a crisis
* I keep looking at my phone and have trouble actually doing anything else with my day (like 8 hours a day).
* I'm very impulsive with money when it comes to buying food
* I have a lot of trouble cooking and focusing on how to make different things
* I've been pretty much a failure at everything I've tried that I either wasn't super excited for
* I know if I get really into something, I'll obsess over it and I won't sleep and I'll just stay up until it's like 5am and I'm falling asleep in my chair, so I haven't been doing anything exciting because otherwise I'm at a much greater risk of dying since I drive a lot for my job.
* I use a plan of hanging out with friends, coffee, imminent deadlines or other exciting things to help me get energized for something that would be torture to do otherwise (cleaning dishes, doing homework, taking a shower, etc)
* I'm usually either very anxious or depressed without a lot of things to do at the same time, or without caffeine (only 300mg per day)
* My dad has adhd, and same with all my closest friends growing up.
* A lot of people in high school thought I was on weed due to my random thinking
* I know that if I didn't have to worry about when I slept and could have food and water and shelter, I'd work on things nearly all the time in sprints of my different interests and create things like I did in high school

I've done a ton of research and basically just keep going in circles over the past few months. 

PLEASE read this and help me with my predicament.

Also: I got diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago, but I'm not confident it was accurate because it was only over an hour, on a day where I only had 5 hours of sleep and drank a coffee about 20 minutes before, and they asked me 92 questions about how often I experience symptoms more than other people I know on a 1-4 scale. Which for me doesn't work well because most of my friends growing up had it, so I can't compare the frequency to them, and my dad has it, and my mom is kinda nuts (BPD) and my little brother, and my newest closest friend both have asperger's. So I compared it to my friend with mild aspergers, and scored a 3 on nearly everything, with some 1s and some 4s.",0
"sick of the double life sorry for the vulgarity, but do yall sometimes just wanna say fuck it and let go of it all? 

about two years ago, i became very involved in scientific research, which i genuinely loved (and still do). this was mainly during covid. 

then i went to high school, and no one liked the same things i did. we werent learning things that were interesting to me in class, either. so id have to go to school and hang out with friends, but later have to go home and grind pset problems from some graduate level math course. and its become exhausting keeping this up. 

learning and engaging in research calms me, bc it addresses all the deeper mental stimulation that i yearn for. at the same time, i feel like it isolates me from really living in the moment in my everyday life. i mean, at the end of the day, im still a normal teenager. i still wanna do dumb shit like sneaking out late at night and drinking white claws with friends at bonfires or asking out the girl i like (who is the very opposite of intelligent and deep), cuz im only going to be in high school once but my academic career awaits me for the rest of my life. 

how do i deal with this? how do you balance emotional needs with intellectual ones?

"How do you keep up with life? Got diagnosed a week ago, and it just confirmed the cause of most struggles I've been going through. But I just feel like it's too late for me to get back on tracks with life, everything just feels so complicated and dull.

I can't understand why I wasn't diagnosed sooner, when working things out was still possible, I literally had the ""profile"" of the gifted kid: Best grades at school, socially awkward, always interested in everything around him, thinking differently etc.... I even got bullied in secondary school and had a psychological monitoring put in place, but it never came to their mind that I might be gifted. A few years later, and I'm dropping out of high school, slowly drifting into loneliness, and yet, despite all the evidence, nobody considers giftedness.

Don't get me wrong, I don't want to blame anyone on this, I'm just frustrated. I feel like my life could be much better if I had received the adequate support for what I was going through, I probably wouldn't be in this state of emptiness and missed achievements...

"Dealing with Obsessions & Traversing faults in logic My current view associates everything with mental illness, it's illogical. It seems the goal of everything I do, is to prove that I am currently experiencing mental illness, I am unable to relax or think freely, as I associate that action with mental illness. It's tough to explain, but it feels like the end destination of every thought, feeling, and action. It doesn’t matter what it is, math, science, English, everything becomes a mental illness. I’m aware that it’s illogical, but it makes it hard to move past it, as you guessed it, moving past this to me is a sign of mental illness. I’m currently at an impasse. This fault in logic is the only suffering im experiencing, and I cannot seem to let it go. Its become an obsession that has taken over every facility of my existence.

I’ve spent hundreds of hours talking with a psychiatrist, and have been reassured I’m not mentally ill, but this keeps prodding at me. She made me aware that I was highly gifted in psychology and philosophy,  among other things.  This seems hard to accept, and I feel like an imposter.

"Is this giftedness or 2e, or neither? So a few years back I was given the WAIS IV, and scored a 121 in my FSIQ. Also, when I was a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD. My verbal comprehension index was 130, with a 13 on similarities, and a 16 on both vocabulary and information. My PRI was 115, with a 14 on matrix reasoning, and a 12 on both block design and visual puzzles. My WMI was the lowest, with a 95, and a 7 on digit span, and an 11 on arithmetic. My processing speed was 124, with a 17 on symbol search, and a 12 on coding. 

I have always felt like an outsider. My interests as a child ranged from astronomy, anatomy, weather, geography, and history. I also enjoy the arts (drawing and painting). When I was diagnosed with ADHD, I was 6 years old. The story, to make it short, was this: In my school there was a library, and I liked searching the books there and getting copies of the sections I wanted to keep for myself to read. It came to the point where I would lie to the teacher about going to the restroom, only to go to the library. As time passed, staff got worried, as the school was poorly fenced and they feared I would leave and get lost. This was in Mexico back in the 90s. One day, I spoke to my English teacher about the differences between whales, dolphins, and fish, and how their tails differed, and how the former were not fish, but mammals. I had watched the 1996 Pinocchio movie when I was like 4, so when I saw the whale, I became obsessed with marine life and learned what I could about it. But my English teacher, not knowing that, called my parents, concerned that I didn't have a childhood, and that they were pushing me too hard and should make me watch cartoons instead. Little did she know that I was the one asking my parents for information, books, and objects such as terraqueous globes (these latter were because of Toy Story 1, when Buzz Lightyear was thrown out by a globe. Me being a kid I just wanted one of those and wanted to read the capitals and the country names. I eventually became famous for ""knowing the capitals of the countries"" at 3), and I got into space because of Toy Story and Star Wars, and into the body because of Magical School Bus! Cartoons were my gateway to these areas. 

But that was not the end of this odyssey. My dad had spoken to me about this character from Mexican history named ""El Pipila"", who stormed a fortress back in the war of independence, carrying a slab of stone, and a torch. I made a drawing of that during class, and because they were fed up with me, I was taken to the office, where the psychologist from the school saw the drawing and interpreted it as me being a pyromaniac, even though I had no interest in setting fires. My parents obviously disagreed with this diagnosis. So the school gave us an ultimatum: we had to get a diagnosis before Thanksgiving, if not, I was to be expelled. So my parents took me to a real psychologist, who after doing some tests, determined I had ADHD. Apparently, she could not administer the WISC correctly because I couldn't sit still, so she had to section it in different sessions. According to my mom, I scored a 140, but had difficulties concentrating and with impulsivity. And I ended up getting expelled because the school said they did not have the resources to accommodate a kid like me. 

Fastforward to me being 11, and I get another test, where I score a 120. And then when I was 23-24, I scored a 121, with the details I wrote in the first paragraph. 

That early experience marked me, as I felt like a reject. And it made me develop this love-hate relationship with school. I liked academics, but distrusted staff. I always felt like I would get in trouble for being me (which happened often throughout my childhood). But I fought hard to overcome that. I eventually went to college, majored in psychology. Finished a masters, and now I am doing a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. 

Some time on 2013, I learned about 2e. The profile fit like a glove. I feel like my strengths sometimes masked my weaknesses, and other times the opposite, leading to me falling through the cracks.",0

Overexcitabilities are the heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities.

I also tested negative for restless leg syndrome.

One of the possible symptoms of autism is hyperlexia, and I’m pretty sure they just mistook my hyperlexia for giftedness. 

Hyperlexia is described as “when a child can read at levels far beyond those expected for their age. “Hyper” means better than, while “lexia” means reading or language. A child with hyperlexia might figure out how to decode or sound out words very quickly, but not understand or comprehend most of what they’re reading”

"Just realized I'm autistic, knew I was gifted my whole life - loneliness and sadness Hello all. I've known that I was gifted my whole life. I was very precocious in my curiosity and language. My dad used to be super proud of me because strangers would comment things like how I was destined for great things. While this was an interesting experience, it was also kind of crippling because I grew up thinking that I needed to invent warp drive or something like that. Anything less was a disappointment, so I eventually gave up on everything. 

I took the MENSA test about a decade ago when I started trying to figure myself out. I wanted to know definitely if I was gifted or not and I scored off the chart. So I've known that I was a statistical anomaly for at least the last 10 years. 

But then more recently I've had social difficulties again, pretty severe. I used to think my social difficulties were only because I was gifted. I read the book Gifted Grownups after I took the MENSA test and so I knew that a lot of gifted people are misunderstood/lonely. However, my life has been kinda rough lately and I met someone who told me about masking/camouflaging. As things got worse, I finally took the CAT-Q and it turns out that I'm also pretty significantly autistic, but I've just been masking hardcore.

I'm writing this because it's only just been over a week since I found out about being ASD and I'm still waiting on my appointment to get a formal diagnosis. As I wait, I'm trying to integrate all this information about myself. I'm gifted and autistic. So I'm a double anomaly. Autism is like 1.5% to 2.2% of the population depending on the source you look at. Then my IQ is like the top 0.2% (not trying to brag, I'm just different). So I am a very rare pokemon. Yay. Writing this out, I just feel sad. 

Sure, there are benefits to being gifted and autistic. My brain can do things that most people can't. But it's also very lonely. Fortunately I've found a partner who is very similar to me - similar IQ and also ASD. But if we're both super rare, like 1/20,000 people or so, I dunno.

I'm about to lose a lot of friends because my mask slipped and I experienced autistic burnout, which is scary to people who don't understand it or are intolerant.

"I’m curious what this sub’s thoughts and experiences are regarding online courses TLDR*
I have a vague question about online courses: are they worthwhile for gifted learners compared to other learning methods? 
Additionally, I am generally curious about gifted and/or passionate learners experiences with Coursera type online courses.

*I put the TLDR at the start because I probably could’ve only written it rather than several paragraphs. My point being, the TLDR and title get my question across so don’t bother reading the rest unless you’re  curious or fond of sloppy and unorganized writing.

    I just graduated high school and I’m yearning for college to start in august. I’ve grown to have a strong urge to be productive and improve myself. 
    To satisfy this, I have begun a couple online courses. They are interesting, however I’m not sure if the structured format is the best way for me to learn. I only have a couple hours of experience with the online courses, so I am here primarily to ask if these courses tend to actually be helpful regarding education and academic merit. 
    The reason I’m asking here is because as far as I am aware, many gifted people tend to get less reward from constructed learning compared to other options like self education or learning from experience. My doubt surrounding structured courses may just be a misunderstanding I have about education based on high school confining us to low level, less interesting courses. I am hopeful that college classes will feel very different, but in the meantime I’m wondering if for someone like me these courses would be worthwhile.",0
"solo-traveling: new old experiences I had the funny idea of flying to South Korea for vacation (I am German, it is my first big travel outside of Europe and alone). Having a bore-out, I needed something new. I am in Seoul since last week and my interaction problems with other people is just the same as back home. I never understood why I am different, why I feel so different, why I couldn't connect, why people don't understand me and vice versa, etc. Learning about giftedness for 1-2 years that it is not just a number but more of a personality trait, I am now able to watch myself interacting with people on those ""different"" levels and what problems I had because of this all my life: all I wanna do is talking about Dabrowski's theory on positive disintegration, but what I actually do is asking my chinese roommate - staying at a 4-bedroom hostel thingy -  if she wants go grab some food ( 吃饭吗?). Her Englisch is not good and my Chinese bad as hell.
I kinda hoped to feel a change or something different in interaction when traveling to a complete different culture, but the alienation feels all the same.

Tl;dr: being different; feeling of alienation is everywhere the same

PS: if somebody from Seoul or other city in South Korea wants to discuss Dabrowskis theory or anything related, send me a message, I am staying until July 3rd.",0
"Research Survey: Concepts and Attitudes towards Giftedness Hello everyone,

Our group of Master's Students at Trier University are currently conducting a research project on concepts and attitudes towards giftedness.

The opinions of people who have experience with giftedness are of particular importance to us.

In the Survey, you will be asked to rate statements about giftedness. The results will be used to construct educational material about the topic.

We would greatly appreciate it, if you could offer 5 minutes of your time to support our research endeavour.

"Advice on possibly starting child in kindergarten early My daughter is four (she turns five at the end of November). She was tested this week by our school system to see if she can start kindergarten this fall (instead of next year when she would normally start). Based on the results of her testing, she has qualified to start early. Her full scale IQ was scored at 135 and her verbal a 140.

I'd like some advice on reasons to consider for not starting her early. If she didn't start early, she'd be going to a pre-school with other four years old. The pre-school does have an educational curriculum and I'm sure the school would work with us to the extent possible to keep her challenged, but I doubt it would be exactly the same. Physically she's one of the tallest children (if not tallest)  in her current pre-school class, so there likely won't be a significant size gap between her and the other kindergarten children.",0

"not sure what to do I've got a gifted grade skipper. She's 11 and just finished 6th grade. She took pre-algebra this year. The start of the year was rough. Transitioning from cyber school (pandemic) to her first year of middle school, on top of her math teacher taking a leave of absence and having a string of subs from September to February. She did not do well the first two marking periods, bad grades, but the second two marking periods were pretty good. Her math teacher contacted me yesterday and suggested that she be placed in regular 7th grade math class next year instead of 7th grade Algebra. He said if she does well, which he is certain she will, then she can take 8th grade Algebra, which is still a year ahead of schedule. Regular 7th grade math isn't even pre-algebra, so it's a step back from where she was this year. It seems like it would be a very easy course for her. I discussed it with my daughter, and she really wants to take the Algebra class in 7th grade. She said she's willing to take Khan Academy pre-algebra over the summer to catch up and try to fill in any gaps. She said she ""wants to be a math person"" and wants to get ahead in math because she wants to be a scientist. Specifically a chemical engineer. Math teacher said it's ultimately up to us, but that the Algebra class is very intense, with a new topic introduced every day and no repeat info. I don't want to discourage my daughter from trying, I don't want to tell her she can't achieve her goals. I want her to believe in herself and know that we believe in her. I should note that a part of her bad grades was due to her having adhd and frequently losing or forgetting to turn in assignments. This happened in all classes. We adjusted her meds and the issue improved. Any advice? Go with teacher recommendation, or go with what child desires?",0
"My giftedness I wrote a similar post on r/confessions but I’m going to put some more details in here.

So, basically, since I was little (and they still continue) people around me have told me how smart I was, I didn’t believe them.

But some months ago I discovered that I apparently studied way less than other people, and that memorizing pages of something just by reading it once  wasn’t normal.

Then, I finally decided to listen to my mom and read a book called “too smart to be happy” (the book isn’t in English but that would be the title) the book was written by a psychologist that focused on gifted people, the book included a lot of literal quotes from actual gifted patients and I identified with every single one of them, that’s where I realized that what I thought was normal and everyone felt was actually exclusive to me, and that’s were things actually started to make sense.

-I realized people didn’t have this absurd empathy, when I experience something with someone, I feel it from my perspective and theirs, from just a few words I can know what type of person you are to some extent and know how you would react in x situation even if I never saw you going through that, I feel others emotions like they are mine, and know how you are going to react if I say x

-I Always felt like I was strange, but I didn’t know why so I just assumed I was straight weird

-having to hold back with other people (talking slower, not talking about something/more complex topics since they think it’s boring and won’t follow the conversation, not correcting them on things I know they are doing wrong, talking less)

-it’s like everyone has these society’s rules incrusted into them and they follow it so naturally but I don’t understand (I don’t  really know how to put it in words so I don’t know if that makes any sense)

-Having “friends” but feeling alone, and not feeling like a normal person, since you don’t do drugs or alcohol, you don’t start a relationship just because, those kinds of things, and find what supposed to be a “normal conversation” boring and not filling

-Having very intense emotions, like feeling things with a lot more intensity than other people 

-wishing I wasn’t gifted, being gifted has also brought bullying and difficult to socialize

There’s more but the post would be too long

I hope I explained myself well

Ps: I didn’t get all these things from the book, (some did come from it) I got it from my own thinking after I became aware I was gifted

Edit: i didnt assume I was gifted just because of the book, but I wasn’t going to make the post so long just to explain something that wasn’t the point",0
"Anyone else having problems with studying? So, you know, the typical thing, I never needed to study and could memorize the unit reading it once or twice.
The thing is I can’t do that anymore, things aren’t easy enough for me to just not study and do well, but since I never had to study it becomes incredibly hard, if I don’t understand it right from the beginning I feel like I’m failing and I don’t even know how to study, I can’t concentrate on studying for too long either

Is this happening to anyone else?",0

"SCAT Prep/ Hopkins CTY Friends: my son came home from school and said his friend was going to “CTY camp.” After looking into it, I was wondering if anyone had any positive or negative experiences with Hopkins CTY that they could share.

"Conflict and Emotional Intensity I love it when people challenge me. I feel exhilaration when my friends are blunt to me, and there's a good, fiery discussion to be had. The grounds of conflict and confrontation, to some extent, is where I learn. I appreciate friends who challenge me. I appreciate friends who are confident and outspoken

Practically, this means I won't shy away from a strong debate where intense emotions arise. I don't mind being provoked. Obviously, I may experience negative emotions in the moment such as frustration, anger, sadness, or fear. Generally, I enjoy the overall experience because whatever brings about such strong emotions has provided me with a strong incentive stimilus to inspect it. I feel like it turns my brain on, and I can process whatever the topic is rapidly and thoroughly. Admittedly, I rarely come to a fruitful conclusive conclusion during these heated discussions, but they give me food for thought to consider and reflect on afterward. Within a couple hours to a day of reflection in solitude I have processed it properly and drawn what feels like a profound conclusion; something I do not experience in ""bland"" discussion (aka without emotional activation).

Now the issue at hand: mostly everyone I've met HATES this. When I respond so strongly to something they say in discussion, it shuts them down. They experience my intensity as hostile, and / or often walk around on egg shells to avoid both hurting me (they feel guilty about evoking intense emotions in me, even though I've assured them I enjoy it) and being hurt themselves (by experiencing my intense responses).

Let me clarify that at no point in discussion I am abusive, nor do I go for personal attack. What I do is respond quick, blunt, and with emotion. When I notice the argument is getting out of hand (eg me or the other starts acting on emotion rather than content) I make sure to disengage.

TLDR: I perceive heated debate as a playground for me to unleash my intensity, try myself out against others from time to time, and a place where I can grow and learn immensely. My friends, however, perceive it as hurtful, feel like their input is discarded, and live in fear of ""activating"" me.

Any advice on how to accommodate my friends would be very welcome. For their sake, I want them to feel safe and valued in providing me with criticism. For my sake, I would preferably continue to experience what I descrived as heated debates for both pleasure and personal development. 

Some personal info I believe might be relevant in considering the issue at hand:
- I'm gifted and I believe a lot of my close friends are either gifted too, or highly intelligent. 
- I specifically have an exceptionally high processing speed
- I have ADHD mixed type. 
- I identify with the enneagram 8 personality type.",0
"Living after giftedness A little bit of a rant, but need advice. I’m an interesting case where I started in special education as a young kid due to speaking a 2nd language and getting my 2 languages mixed up when speaking to teachers. Also, I was diagnosed with ADHD but my mother was completely adamant that it was a misdiagnosis and my hyperactivity was due to drinking coffee in the morning (my dad spoiled me). Anyways, fast forward, my teachers noticed that by the time I got to the 4th grade, I was getting straight A’s in special ed and extremely bored. They placed me in “ regular” classes and still maintained getting straight A’s and being bored and then was placed in Advanced classes. Advanced/ honors classes challenged me but I never really needed to study to maintain an above average GPA. 

Now as an adult, I feel a little empty. I have amazing ideas for novels but don’t know how to execute. I feel like because I never had to try during my early education, I am left with a handicap. Has any of you gifted individuals felt this way? 

I want to to write.. and execute these ideas.. should I get a writing coach ? Where should I start?",0

"Opinion on which direction I should go with my 6 year old My daughter is six and will be going into first grade next year. We noticed some issues with anxiety and very advanced language. At four we had her tested by a psychologist due to concerns about her not adjusting to preschool and new environments. The evaluator gave her the wppsi her full scale IQ score was 130, verbal comp 135, visual spatial 115, working memory 124. We had her tested for GT in kinder. They do achievement tests in reading and math. She qualified in reading at the 98th percentile. She did not qualify in math at the 78th percentile. They did not administer a cognitive test and she did no qualify for the GT program. They recommended having her retested next year since she qualified in one area. I suspect she is a bright child but not gifted. She picks up new concepts quickly but still needs to be taught. She does complain about being bored with class work and wants to know when she can do different work from peers. The kinder curriculum has been too easy for her overall. She is doing much better adjusting to kinder and is doing ok socially. My question is should I have her retested next year or just let it go?",0
"Son just tested into Gifted Hey all, I’m new to this sub so feel free to redirect me. My son just tested into gifted. He is six. He dominated the IQ portion and then skated through the other stuff and did slightly above average there. I KNOW he knows that stuff, he’s just not interested in performing. Also, he still sometimes reads or does math backwards which is interesting because his spatial reasoning is off the charts. He sees things his own way often. 

We did not tell him exactly what the assessment is for; I mentioned it was a way to know what he knows so we can know what to teach him. My concern is I’m wondering if I’m missing something big (adhd, dyslexia, anxiety) or if he’s just not motivated to do work that seems pointless to him. This is a child who builds circuits and inventions all day while talking in adult language. He is not lacking in ingenuity, enthusiasm or social skills. His dad and I were both gifted kids as well and aren’t sure what the best steps are for him in the future. Any thoughts?",0
"IQ tests' results aren't as meaningful compared to when you take them as a kid, when IQ tests tend to be administered. Obsession with these tests now will only leave you disappointed or haughty. Developing your empathy and improving your confidence, in yourself, is more important. Taking an IQ test as an adult is not a good measurement of giftedness, as it is innate and recognizable and quantifiable at a young age. Gifted children's IQ tend to then increase with age, not decrease, given their innate abilities, especially for those who are 2E. That is why they, if their family or teachers notice, tend to get placed into special or particular programs early on. Including whole institutions for the gifted youth, where they congregate. You won't find them on Google the way you think you will. It's not kept secret. It's just what it is, and we just don't care or regard it as anything special. Others do, especially those who perhaps have low self-esteem and bet everything on their perceived giftedness.

Adults can outsmart things easily. Children, meanwhile, aren't obsessing over anything in such a manner. They know they are different. Everyone has told them; there is no doubt. And yet there is. There is a lot of self-doubt in unique ways that are not immediately recognizable or identifiable by others. It can get lonely and extremely alienating, very easily. A lot of gifted children grew up isolated, mocked and rejected by their peers, due to their idiosyncrasies. Or they were homeschooled/heavily accommodated for. Or they blended in with the crowd. Masking.

We tend to keep to ourselves and keep our circles tight and cherished. We tend to observe. We meditate on our precepts, or we learn to, eventually. It usually comes with maturity/healing. 

Many of you would benefit from looking into motivational intelligence and motivated reasoning, but that post was downvoted and dismissed, which was curious. I think only one or two people were actually engaged. In any event, MQ is also helpful for gifted children who are now gifted adults and are still struggling, hurting, or lost. Hang in there.

"""Type of giftedness"" and career choices Do you believe that people should take mainly into consideration their abilities when it comes to choosing a career path?

Well, first I'll give you context: though I am conventionally gifted in the sense that my IQ is 130+, my score in ""verbal comprehension"" is outstandingly the highest (let's say that I'm mainly verbally gifted). Furthermore, though I'm usually praised for my writing abilities in my native language and people sometimes get surprised at the speed at which I can learn languages without actually studying or living in ""the correct"" environment, I don't ""feel"" that my abilities in math are strong and, honestly, I sometimes feel a little incompetent though I never put a lot of effort in trying to learn math.

In spite of it, I plan on studying economics (""economy"" in my country which is the specific degree in economics that allows one to become an economist and, as far as I know, is the most intense in mathematics), a news that hasn't really been well received by most people -especially [my native language] teachers- and left me feeling like I'm wasting my potential and choosing both a degree that will be very hard for me (not that I would like to study a non-challenging degree, but still) and a career that won't make me happy because of my own incompetence and the effect that that might have over my motivation and, consequently, how much I'll like my job.

Rephrasing the initial question: do you think that I should abandon the idea of studying economics and just pick a more verbal-skills-related degree?

I apologize if what I wanted to express wasn't completely clear as English isn't my native language.",0

"which camp are you for active or passive nihilism ?  

# Active vs. Passive Nihilism

A great many philosophers have dedicated considerable amounts of their waking moments wrestling with the problem of nihilism; or more specifically, the problem of overcoming nihilism. Nevertheless, nihilism itself remains a mystery — least of all its consequences for mankind. To be sure, an adequate definition of nihilism is wanting. In the most general sense, nihilism refers to the absence of any objective, universal or intrinsic value. From this, it necessarily follows that our metaphysical beliefs, our moral/ethical values, and even our own existence, are completely and utterly lacking any inherent meaning.

As a direct consequence of nihilism, man is forced to see reality for what it is: a random, irrational, and chaotic existence in which our role is infinitesimal. Nihilism, in this capacity, serves to break down all the illusions, myths, and all other social, cultural constructions that have hitherto given us a false sense of security and hope.

In its active form, nihilism is likened to a hammer — used not only to chisel away all artificial meaning, but to smash them. Active nihilism paves the way for the creation of new values, the overcoming of the self by taking a new relation to oneself as an autonomous creator. In effect, this is the transformation of living as the “one-self,” into “my-self.” Thus, the end result of nihilism in its active form is nothing short of paving the way for the grounds to becoming my own self.

Passive nihilism, on the other hand, is epitomized by resignation; the prognosis that life is an “unprofitable episode,” (in Schopenhauer’s words). Nietzsche equated passive nihilism with Schopenhauer’s repudiation of life via the denial of the Will as a great threat. Nihilism in its passive form, while adopting the same prognosis of existence as active nihilism, thus nevertheless takes the opposite stance of active nihilism as to how we should respond to the problem of a meaningless, value-less, and chaotic existence.",0
"which would you say you operate from in regards to Nietzsche master and slave morality ?  

## Master morality

Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. He criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten its origins and that it is based merely on habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He writes that in the prehistoric state ""the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences""[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche197362-1) but that ultimately ""\[t\]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche197396-2) For strong-willed men, the ""good"" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the ""bad"" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty.

The essence of master morality is *nobility*. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the ""noble man"", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. ""The noble type of man experiences *itself* as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, ""what is harmful to me is harmful in itself""; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is *value-creating*.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-3) In master morality, people define the good based on whether it benefits them and their pursuit of self-defined personal excellence.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-Solomon-4): loc 1134, loc 1545  Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization) through the [will to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power).

## Slave morality

According to Nietzsche, masters create morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [re-sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment)—devaluing what the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as good.

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is *utility*:[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973122-5) The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche sees this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [will to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power)) are evil, as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [Biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical) principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. ""The *democratic* movement is the heir to [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity)""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973125-6)—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

>...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused ""rich"", ""godless"", ""evil"", ""violent"", ""sensual"" into one, and were the first to coin the word ""world"" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for ""poor"" as a synonym for ""holy"" and ""friend"") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With *them*, there begins the *slave revolt in morals*.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973118-7)

According to Nietzsche, the struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. He noted that ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [Homeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the [*Iliad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad) and [*Odyssey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey) exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes ""men of a noble culture"",[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973153-8) giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as Christianity's slave morality spread throughout the Roman Empire.

After the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD Judea completely lost its independence to Rome, and after the defeat of the Bar-Kokhba revolt in 136 AD it ceased to exist as a national state of Jewish people. The struggle between the polytheistic culture of Rome (master, strong) and newly developed Christian monotheism in former Judea and surrounding territories in the Middle East (slave, weak) lasted continuously until 323, when Christianity became the Roman Empire's official religion. Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the ""*collective degeneration of man*"".[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973127-9) He claims that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [ressentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment) Nietzsche calls ""priestly vindictiveness"",[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche196719-10) based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong and thus erode the basis for power by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by ""the most intelligent revenge"" of the weak.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-11) Nietzsche saw democracy and Christianity as the same emasculating impulse, which sought to make everyone equal by making everyone a slave.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the ""be-all, end-all"" behavior. He thought that the [revaluation of morals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaluation_of_values) would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality.\[[*cit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)",0
"Heightened intuition towards people’s motives and emotions? Any other gifted people have this trait? It’s almost like a sixth sense. Like you can sense what a person is like, and any small gesture or facial expression gives away what they are like, what they’re thinking of/how they feel, or how the situation would play out. I’m also not saying I get it right each and every time, just plenty enough times to notice that it could be a part of being gifted.",0

How exactly is intelligence an obstacle to socialization I’ve basically always been weird. No one cared to take a deeper look at why I was difference so at some point in my early childhood adults who viewed me as some nuisance tried to justify putting me under medication by putting me through an iq test failed when the results came back at high score. I don’t think i come off as particularly intelligent. Mainly because people tell me I’m a smart guy like it was an unexpected fact. Actually I bet ppl think I’m probably pretty dumb since i have no reaction to the things people think are important lol. I try to get into the convo and I can’t help but to feel like I’m interrogating others for everything they know. Ugh why are my questions so weird.. They sound reasonable until I hear them out loud then it sounds so piercing. Even though I’ve only asked like 2 good questions. I’m trying to be more sociable man. I just need to understand why people think as they do better...,0

"Burnout theory Hi, all. I have a theory about burnout. 

I think sometimes it happens from living someone else plan for one's life. I think some of us are reduced to what grades and degrees we can produce and get tired of it. Simply put, we want to be treated like full human beings. 

We have feelings and interests which may not always be academic. 

Honestly, I haven't had the best experiences with being gifted. I lived with what some would call oppression. I have people who are inside and outside my family essentially say that I'm nothing without school and that I could not do well at anything else, and also that even if I could do well at something else I shouldn't bother anyway. Everything must be school, school, then work your life away. I've had to deal with my family and their self fulfilling prophecies. After all that, why would I want to be The Smart One?

Imo if someone told a gymnast she could never do well at anything else and forced to spend all her time practicing that would be abusive. Yet people feel perfectly justified in doing something similar to people they perceive as smart. 

Not long ago I watched a documentary about schooling in Asia. One student said she realized she was doing all that work to make her parents and school happy. What did she want to do? She wanted to play musical instruments!

Of course, this could be mostly projection, but I would like other opinions.",0

"Why did my IQ test scores vary so extremely? Which result should I trust more? Hi dear community

As a child (I was around 10 years old) I did an IQ test administered to me by professionals and got 114 points.

Then, with 25 years of age, I did a somewhat professional looking online IQ test and scored the exact same 114 points.

So I believed I was not gifted until recently, when I had to do my third IQ test (Raven’s 2) as part of a psychological examination. Interestingly enough, now I suddenly scored 133 points.


It concerns me a bit that these results vary so widely. How can this be? And which result should I believe now?

Thanks in advance for all answers!",0

"Anyone else have issues keeping friends? During a given semester at college I take on a lot in terms of work and classes and such, to a point where I don’t really have much time to see friends besides an occasional once a week sort of thing. When I’m deep into work, I don’t really feel a need to see them though, as I’m completely content with spending almost all my time doing work. Unfortunately, it’s led to me not having much contact with them in general.

However, I find myself having an issue where I’ll only feel lonely or in need of friends when I have free time that I could be using spending time with people. It doesn’t feel like I have enough free time to foster great relationships with others. On one hand I’m able to do lots of work without being able to burn out or anything, but on the other it just makes me feel very isolated when I do have the time to see people. I know the responsibility falls on me to try and make these relationships happen, but it just feels hard when I don’t feel much motivation a majority of the time. 

Anyone else have this issue?",0

"Social obstacles In my pursuit of health, lack of supportive relationships, lack of love, and painful loneliness have been long fought obstacles. I've read books and saught external help for relationships, but intelligence and giftedness seem to be a significant factor which makes these challenges feel so personal and unshakable.
As I've learned that authenticity is sacred, and learned to listen to what my gut and soul wants, I feel the shallow relationships I have are disolving away. 
So commonly and constantly I hear follow your interests and passions, connect with people of similar interests. But having similar interests has never felt enough on its own. To be interested in the same things as other people doesn't feel like enough. The depth and intensity of my interests compared to others leave me feeling lonely and different. It hurts when I'm told so often to find a group or community I vibe with, when it's so hard to find just a single friend.
Maybe I'm going about things the wrong way, maybe I'm too blinded or trapped by the barriers of my past traumas. Maybe all this failure is a powerful lesson in persistence. It would be nice to think there's something to gain from this struggle.

"How do you learn to balance work and sources of joy? Hello,

I've been struggling for a long time with burnout, and it's been very intense for the past two years or so. My life is focused on fulfilling obligations and meeting the expectations of others -- making sure that everything is done correctly and to the best of my abilities to avoid becoming a disappointment. I have classmates that make similar grades as me, but they seem so much less disordered in the way that they gain their achievements. They're still able to have time for themselves, for their friends, and for the things they love...but I don't. I'm constantly taking work home and spending my free time doing schoolwork. Otherwise, I'll fall behind, and when I fall behind, a lot of bad things happen and I start losing the respect of others. 

I'm constantly being pressured by my gifted teacher and others to keep doing more, more, *more*. My gifted teacher guilt trips me for not doing more. I need to do CLEP and/or dual enrollment courses after school, but I don't have time for either of those things. I'm already busy. I already do/have done AP classes, and I'm going to have an AP class and a dual enrollment class in the upcoming school year. I *know* I won't have time to do what she expects of me. It hurts when we talk about these things, because she makes it so obvious that she isn't pleased with me, but I've already given up every part of my being for things like this. I don't feel like I'm living for myself anymore.

I want to be able to have at least a little time for myself. I want to be able to improve in art, so that I can be respected for something that I love rather than something I force myself to do. I want to be able to keep up with others in watching shows and movies. I want time to turn everything off and just exist without stress.

How do you create and maintain a balance between work and sources of joy? How can I balance keeping afloat at school and advancing myself in my hobbies? It feels like I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. I'm constantly fatigued and stressed.

"Is it possible to ""grow out"" giftedness? First of all, I'm not sure if the title is appropriate for what I want to say. English is not my native language, and I learned this expression (""to grow out"") from the ADHD community.

I'm 2e (Gifted+ADHD, and possibly ASD too). Once I started the treatment for ADHD when I was seven years old, people didn't stop telling me I was gifted, always getting the best grades in school. I kept gifted even one decade later after I finished the treatment.

Gifted+ADHD/ASD was the perfect recipe for my odd interests that made people expect more from me than I'm nowadays. I learned to read at three years; at seven, my favorite activity was reading biographies of famous scientists. When I was younger, I showed an affinity for computers. I learned PHP and Javascript in the last years of elementary school and Java in junior high school. The people thought I would have been an IT genius.

At the beginning of senior high school, I switched from informatics to chemistry. At the end of high school, I changed to linguistics. Of course, I'm ADHDer, so I never had an interest in a single area.

Finally, college came, and my 2e-brain isn't good enough to manage time properly. In the first year of college, I was interested in social research, but I dropped all my interests because of the lack of time and the boredom. Then the pandemics came, I finished college, and I started to work recently in the administrative area of a factory (I studied International Commerce).

Now, I don't have any special interest to pursue and the job steals all my time and energy necessary to learn new things or do something interesting. I found my job boring. I do the same activity every day.

Is this what it feels to be a gifted adult? Or is it just my ADHD? Or maybe I lost my 2e giftedness, and I became a normal adult and what I feel is common for the rest of the people...

I don't know why, but recently I became afraid of being just common.",0

"Feeling like I wasted potential. (I’m really sorry this is very long )

Hi. So I’m currently 15, and I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt about the way my academic life has gone so far. A bit of detail:

To begin with I guess I could say I was intelligent. My mother was a pretty Smart woman, not insanely gifted or anything but probably above average, she worked as a lawyer but put the family above her career. Now my dad, is something else. He is probably one of, if not the most intelligent person I have ever met. He comes across as just a regular guy but he is just very intelligent, his IQ is probably 145+. I mean there is newspaper clippings of him in Liverpool and how he just absolutely smoked everyone else in terms of academic ability, It’s what people have said stands out about him, it’s why my mum dated him, even police officers have mentioned it. So yeah, genetically I was pretty lucky.


From a young age, 5+, i got a reputation for being academically gifted. Not bragging or anything but I remember periods when I would finish the work so quickly I would help the other kids out, which my teachers loved. Looking back I thought ‘Maybe I just developed quicker’ but at the same time I’ve had people call me intelligent my whole life just through speaking to them, so maybe it was true. Compared to my brother and sister, my parents have told me privately that I was more gifted than the others (I am quite similar to my dad personality wise, so maybe I got his genes ) and that they could tell early on.

Long story short my mum decided to move me to a private school as she wanted me to have more academic ‘support’ if you will. Now the thing about me is that I absolutely despised school as a child. I would never read books, stories, anything, and I had a habit of coasting just based on natural ability. This happened the second I reached the private school. Teachers instantly knew I had potential and I was told that by them at age 9, however I was incredibly lazy and didn’t seem to care enough about school, leading to pretty average results academically.


Once I hit about 11/12 ish, I just felt so average. Maybe it was the lack of hard work, or things going on at home (I suffer with really bad depression and anxiety, and a lot of things went on at home , abuse etc) but I just ‘Lost’ that spark, the ability to be ‘like a sponge’ and soak up information like it was nothing seemed to have dissappeared. I always wondered why. Thing is that, with barely any effort, I seemed to do great in English, and other non-mathmatical subjects but maths was a massive weakness of mine and I wonder if it’s due to ADHD (had basically all of the symptoms my whole life but never had it checked). In terms of IQ, I was still gifted, but not 130+ like I used to be. my head just felt so slow compared to how it was a child (pre 11), I found solving problems difficult when before it was a breeze.


Recently my education has taken a nose dive, at 13 I went to another private  school but got bullied and it put me in a situation of further academic damage. I’ve been doing online school for over a year and it’s incredibly difficult , I’ve barely learnt a thing since 2020 October and I’ve had to revise to claw my way back. My mental health is at an all time low right now so I guess that isn’t helping, but I just feel like I wasted my academic potential. I never took advantage of the  gifts I had, and my insane procrastination and laziness basically meant I learnt off poured ability alone but I was still much slower than my classmates when it came to learning. I just wonder why I lost it at such a young age? I get some of it is out of my control but I really want to reignite that once clear spark of brilliance I had inside. Any advice on how I can get it back? Thanks",0
"Shame & doubt after assessment I don’t know where to start but basically, I (F22) went in for a full neuropsychological assessment (9 to 4pm, got a 30mn break to eat) last week. I went in to diagnose / eliminate 3 main diagnoses, which are ADHD, autism and possibly giftedness. I’m rather sure I have ADHD since like half of my family has it & I’ve been on Adderall for almost 8 years now ; as for giftedness and autism, I wanted to rule it out or confirm these. I also have been diagnosed with chronic depression (I do not think it is drug-resistant depression as the meds last long enough to make enough of an impact, but major depressive episodes have been recurring since I was 11) & GAD. 

The neuropsychologist & the consenting form basically said we’d spend maybe 45-1h at most on the anamnesis and then like 5-6h on the cognitive / IQ test(s) (I think it was the WAIS). 

However, the anamnesis lasted like 2h at the very least (!), and the neuropsychologist made many comments that intrigued me. I’m a neuropsychology/sociology major, so ofc, I kinda know a lot of things on the subjects and as such, he said to me he reformulated a lot of the questions since I knew the DSM-V criteria for some of the disorders ; asked me if I had already had done some tests or researched on them (which I did) ; basically said I seemed to be knowledgeable about what I have or haven’t (like dyslexia), but I was like, lol, you’re the professional, self-diagnoses are only valid to an extent, so this is why I wanna make it official. I felt like I was taken seriously, which has been rare for me with psychologists, but I also don’t know if he just said that to see about my social awareness / self-confidence.

The test portion lasted maybe 4 hours ; however, I saw that he tested me a lot more on attention / short-term memory than any other cognitive functions. I asked him why I didn’t get tested on linguistic / verbal comprehension tasks more than 2 or 3 tasks, and he was like, you basically blew off / aced the tests so I don’t think it’s necessary to assess you on that. 

I’ve been over-analyzing my possible results (which only come in like, 1 month, which is torture to me lmao) ever since and I feel that my IQ test won’t be conclusive/even as I feel some tests were extremely easy and others very hard. I feel like maybe I thought I was gifted but was very wrong to think that, and I can’t stop anticipating my final report. It's brought me intense feelings of guilt, shame & self-doubt which I find hard to deal with.

If anyone has had a similar experience, I’d really appreciate to hear about your thoughts & experiences !!!",0
"Conceptual VS performance For my whole life I've had a lot of experience with people of all different levels of intelligence, from low intelligence to exceptionally bright. One thing I've noticed is that smarter people tend to prefer mental tasks that demand ""performance."" I'm guessing this is where general intelligence differences really present themselves most clearly. Smarter people prefer these things because this is where their advantage is biggest.

By ""performance"" I'm referring to tasks like math. I myself (more in the middle at 130) have usually preferred the more conceptual areas because they doesn't require as much effort or strain me as much, as long as it doesn't get too complicated (which usually means the management of many variables at once, which is performance). Let's put it this way: conceptual is like learning, say, that the speed of light is constant for all observers and why. Anyone can do that, because there isn't any actual ""mental load,"" it's not fundamentally different from learning about the lore of some fictional universe. What makes physics challenging is performance, the details, which would be something like learning about Einstein field equations. This causes mental strain when processing. It's an actual weight to be lifted with intelligence. Smarter people tend to gravitate towards these areas because they're ""stronger,"" it's much easier to them. (Sadly for the rest of us, these areas are also necessary for any significant contributions).

You could probably think about topics like philosophy or anything conceptual forever, but anything performance-related or quantitative will eventually make you tired. That explains why the more brilliant people tend to prefer performance - because g is the capacity to ""crunch numbers,"" that mental strength that allows one to succeed when mental performance is needed. From my observations almost all smart people prefer these areas. That's just my theory, let me know your thoughts.",0
DAE deal with a lot of chronic illness alongside and relates to your giftedness. I have seen a limited anecdotal scan of research that that there is some connection between a hyperactive brain and a hyperactive and therefore ill body such as degeneration and older agent heart conditions Viral and auto immune issues are extremely prominent probably because the micro structure of the brain is actually exceedingly important and so disrupting that as it is It has more side effects than we might initially presume and children never are never more active not neurologically but neurologically are gonna seek more situations that might expose them to such things,0
"Arrogance in thought We all have to view the world in some way. It doesn't matter if we're qualified - it's a human need. Even early societies with very little knowledge of how the world works came up with their own stories to explain it (and often took those stories very seriously). Knowing is a necessity, and when we don't know, we delude ourselves into thinking we do. 

We often use ""reasoning"" as a substitute for knowledge. We think of what must be true when we do not know what's true. We also use it in place of concrete evidence when trying to convince people of things. I'm using it right now. It's a necessary thing sometimes - reasoning prevents stagnation, it allows the progress that we have to thank for us no longer living in caves. The problems are obvious though: it's less stable and more vulnerable to bias. Also, if you want to do it from scratch (meaning creating your own worldview and using that instead of using someone else's to justify something) you need very high intelligence to do it properly.

Here's my problem: I don't like what a lot of other people have come up with. All the popular views suck and seem flawed to me. A lot of very smart people have believed in them. It feels like I have the answers, or at least, like mine are better than most people's.

The problem is that the claim that I know better takes some VERY high intelligence to justify. And I'm not that smart, based on my performance on any sort of objective test (only +2 SD, barely made the cutoff). That means I can't trust my own ability to think. But if I can't reason properly, then that puts me in a very strange situation.

I can simply adopt other people's beliefs. But that's not really possible because they seem to be so clearly flawed to me. Many of them also contradict one another. It's expecting me to somehow see that 2+2 = 5. It can't be done.

Besides, the majority has been wrong before. See those ""early societies"" as an example. The average person today probably wouldn't fit in. You might be arrogantly refusing to believe the smart people who say that the Sun revolves around the Earth, for example. Or maybe a better example: a lot of people once believed that beliefs and virtues of their time period, that may not still be popular today, were objective truth. You can argue that they're not, but how do you know that?

Then there's the issue that this would basically turn me into an NPC implicitly accepting whatever I am told. If I lack the judgement to keep my own ideas, how can I be sure the choice to accept others' ideas is right? How can I even make my own decisions? Even a more neutral approach, where I rely on other people's judgement only for matters I don't know much about, would cause the same problem. Humans need ideas about things. I will never know as much about anything as the person who knows the most about that thing. Where is the point where I know ""enough"" to be able to have my own ideas? There isn't much middle ground here because any point like that would be arbitrary. It seems like I have to assume that I have the ability to think as a starting point for anything. If I can't assume that then nothing else is available to me, not even listening to other people's ideas.

On the other hand, if I stick to my own beliefs, I'm placing trust in someone who's unqualified. I am telling all the people smarter than me that no, they're all wrong. It's arrogance and foolishness. It allows me to be an individual, but it also makes me a crazy person type of individual, not any sort of rebel or free thinker. That's basically the difference between a crazy person and a proper free thinker: the free thinker is smart enough to be right.

Neither option works. It seems like my mistake was not being born smarter than everybody else. I'm essentially asking what to do when you can't trust your own mind. Either I give up my ability to be an individual or I'm arrogant. Either I'm not an individual or the stupid type of individual. It's like I have to assume I can think, even if I can't, because everything follows from the ability to think. Everything has to pass through my mind so in order to access anything I basically have to assume I can reason properly even if I can't. Any guidance is welcome.",0

"Large changes in IQ scores from childhood to adulthood ​Long personal story about IQ scores changing considerably, TLDR at the end.

Recently, I (20f) decided to get tested for ADHD. As part of my ADHD assessment, I had to take a cognitive test, specifically the WAIS-IV. 

At age 8, I was identified as gifted through the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test (CCAT), and although I was not present during the debrief between my parents and the school principal, my dad later told me that I had scored in the high 99th percentile, and how the school principle and other teachers had never seen a score that high in their careers. The IQ scored on that test was 142.

That score got me admission into the district's gifted program, which required a minimum IQ of 130. In the program, the teacher called us her ""special cherubs,"" and that, along with meeting other extremely intelligent and motivated folks reinforced me tying my self-worth to my intelligence, particularly in how my intelligence was viewed by others. I remember saying that I ""want to always be the smartest in the room,"" and having my peers look up to me (or resent me) made me happy. My ego was definitely unchecked.

Fast forward to age 10, we had to take a few more (paper) cognitive tests to stay in the gifted program through middle school. This time though, I was so anxious when writing the test, that I blacked out afterwards. When the results came back, my father went to speak with the school principal (a different school, and a different person) to find out my test results. I remember he was so angry, that my class could hear him yelling at the principal from our classroom, and later my dad gave me the silent treatment for what felt like forever. The issue? My IQ score was 131. He said that it ""couldn't be possible,"" and yelled at for not working hard enough. Of course, all of that did no good for my self-esteem, and further perpetuated the notion that my worth was directly proportional to my test scores.

Due to a lack of funding, the gifted program got cut the next year, and in order for me to accelerate through math curriculums, my middle school had me take the WIAT-III, a more hands-on cognitive test assessing reading, writing, and math skills. My reading comprehension scores were in the above average range, but my math scores were   considerably higher. I've sadly lost the math page of the report, but my overall IQ score was 130. 

We had always known that I was more of a math person, so that wasn't surprising at all. With my math score, I was allowed to take math at one grade level higher than mine, and actually sit in an 8th grade math class when I was in 7th grade. I was very impressed by myself, and my entire school knew me as the math whiz. In 7th grade, I wrote the 8th grade-level math competition, and won the provincial 1st place medal.

Then at age 13 I went through some serious psychological trauma that destroyed my mental health.

In my 8th grade year, I didn't win any competitions, but I was still a year ahead in math, self-directing myself through high-school (9th grade) math, and did recently on the standardized final exam.

In my first year of highschool, I accelerated through my math courses taking both grade 10 and 11 math in school. That year, I was recommended to write a different provincial math competition specifically for highschool students aged 17 and under. I crushed the first round, with a near perfect score, and was invited into the second round limited to students with the top 50 scores from the first round. I did terribly on this one because the format was new to me, and it was just a couple months after my stay in a psych ward.

Somehow, my scores from the competition caught the eye of the Canadian Mathematical Society, and I was invited to a math summer camp for the top-30 students in the province under the age of 16.

Of the top 30, I was definitely the 30th. I felt so stupid compared to all the other kids, and did terribly on all of our practice math olympiads.

After this experience, I was crushed. I stopped working hard and more importantly, I stopped trying to learn.

I still did okay in school, and graduated from the IB diploma programme, but I did zero homework, procrastinated constantly, and felt no joy from learning.

In my first year of university, I was a math major. A logical choice right? I used to love math, was somewhat good at it, and  I could finally fulfill my dream of learning real analysis.

I failed every single math course in that year. Calc I, I failed twice, even though it was essentially just a review from highschool, a class I had gotten over 90% in. It almost felt like my brain forgot how to work.

From the age of 14 and onwards, I was in various treatments for my mental health, and I know (logically) that it has changed the way my brain is 'wired'.

Now back to the ADHD.

In my feedback session last week, I learned of my diagnoses, but also the results of my cognitive test. Here are a few of my scores that I remember the oral session (I'll be getting my written report in a few days):

Working memory: 92th percentile

Processing speed: 37th percentile

Overall: 92th percentile (IQ of 122)

I don't know how to feel. IQ is something that doesn't change very much from childhood to adulthood, but IQ scores of 142, 131 and 122 are extremely different from one another. Obviously the testing in childhood was not as rigorous, it was just a pencil-and-paper test, whereas my most recent test was mostly oral, with some physical manipulation. 

I can't help but feel that I've become stupid now, and that I'm just a fraud. I can't even say that I'm gifted anymore (not that I go around in life telling people my IQ, fortunately my social skills are better than that).

TLDR: I'm wondering what this community thinks: Does a more recent evaluation render previous IQ scores obsolete, or are all the scores still valid in a sense? Has anyone else experienced such drastic changes in their IQ scores?",0

"I need help sorting my thoughts. Do I even have the right to complain about my IQ or is it just the under-representation of the darker side of intellectual giftedness, that makes me think I have no right to complain? I have been struggling lately. So, apparently I am ""gifted"" (IQ over 130), but I never feel like it. I was tested last August and I don't know how to handle the result. I always searched for an answer to my struggles academically and socially and thought it would solve all my problems if I had an answer, but it does not. Instead it has all gotten worse. Now, everytime I fail, I tell myself I shouldn't have for I have all the abilities to succeed. Only one of my teachers knows about the fact that I am gifted and now I have failed my 15page-paper in her class (6/15 points) and feel as she might think I lied about my IQ or sth. When I think rationally, I sound insane saying/believing that, yet what if it's true. I feel as if everyone who knows about it expects me to achieve greatness in everything I do, my parents tell me it doesn't matter to them they just want me to be happy, but again, what if they lie so I don't feel as pressured. I try to live up to that expectation of an over-achiever bc I still believe that is what I should be, but instead I just end up with anxiety and struggles concentrating. It does not matter how good my grades are, I still feel like, excuse my language here, shit. Has anyone experienced sth like that? My brain always spins around, thoughts crashing down, I am struggling to concentrate. - So, I am sorry if my problem isn't that accesable from my description, any thoughts are welcome though.

Also, are there more peopel who can only find peace at night, with headphones on and creating an own world? I do this, as far as I can remember visually, since seventh grade, it is the only moment I have full controll over anything that happens and the only time I feel not like an alien to the world, for the world I am in at night is my own.",0

"gifted people are often as closed minded as neurotypicals and i find it hard to relate to them I've thought that maybe it's a magnitudional thing; maybe the more gifted you are the more strongly you embody openness, eccentricity, and sensitivity, but i don't really score higher than 145 which is only 15 points above the cutoff for giftedness. plus, IQ seems very dodgy.

People I've found in this community feel just as cold and empty as others. I don't specifically say this to insult anyone, I can only view this from my perspective, but it's overwhelmingly the way i feel.

I would like to hear from the perspective of others. Gifted people i've met tend to dislike me but they only rarely say why. Usually, people ignore me or i feel a passive-aggressive vibe, but on rare occasions of honesty they say i act ""insane"", the things i say sound ""cursed"", or that i ""schizopost"", (it's actually so funny to say those things in a serious post ksgkdhj)

To me, what i say and who i am sounds completely normal, often just a bit eccentric or theatric, but i feel like my core personhood is being gaslighted and pathologised. People have said they understand but they mostly don't.

i really want to form healthy relationships and be myself but i've only managed to really love and build healthy relationships with a few people. most people i've connected with have been either fictional, dead, or people in my dreams, although i have connected to 2 real people.

I just want to drink tea in a forest somewhere with someone i truly love. In my mind, what i look for in the world doesn't seem too logically absurd, but being perceived that way constantly feels like it's making me insane.",0
"Possibly Gifted? Recently my 3.5 year old took a kindergarten readiness test through our school district. We wanted validation of where she’s at since she will be transitioning to preschool in the fall)and we didn't want her stuck some where learning things that she already knew.

She scored in the 97th percentile and has conceptual age of 5. Obviously, we're not sure if she's truly gifted or advanced.

She speaks like an adult and has an answer for absolutely everything. Her verbal communication is off the charts. She's constantly mistaken,for being older than she is.I swear she could start reading any time she wanted to. Her ability to draw connections with different concepts blows my mind.  Her memory has always been extraordinary.  She's also funny, (very) intense at times, competitive, and drawn to people of all ages. As a baby, she hit all of her milestones early. Just after she turned 2, she was speaking in long, complex grammatically correct sentences.

Our pediatrician (who is also a close family friend and had her own experiences with gifted family members) told me a long time ago that if our kiddo  continued going at the pace she was developing, we might want to watch out for giftedness.  


We chose a play based nature school for her next steps. Right now, I just try to follow her lead with interests and see where that takes us. I'm not too worried about academics right now. She'll have plenty of time for that. 

How likely is it that we can expect her to stay on this same trajectory? 
Any ideas on how to support her needs?

"I messed up my interpretation of time. I feel that recently I started thinking more deep about the idea of time, why is it slow or fast, everything will end one day, one day my reality will be that I am really old and I will feel that my life went by really quick, when I get into those thoughts I tend to feel the emotions and approach to reality that I imagine that person would have.
So I've come to the resolution that everytime there is a bad moment in my life I know that time is nothing, that this moment will pass through like nothing because one day I'll be old and feel that life went by, and actually it works, i feel that those bad moments go by fast, which is getting scary, because even when I have good moments I feel they will go fast and they do, suddenly I feel everything is going so quick and in no time I'll actually be the old man feeling that his life went by in a slap of fingers.

"Is the grass greener elsewhere? Do you think some countries are more high IQ/gifted people friendly than others?

Culturally speaking?

As an example, the country I live in, gifted kids weren't recognized 15 / 20 years ago and were suffering a lot at school. The only thing that was offered to them was to advance classes. They weren't provided with more knowledge / stimulation beside this and were forced to follow the average curriculum, resulting in immense boredom and depressed states.

Even nowadays, I would say things didn't change much beside more awareness in schools on how to potentially recognize a gifted child. I would say that there is quite a gap here regarding giftness / high IQ awareness...

Also, intelligence isn't valued. The culture is pretty much pushing everyone to be at the same level (level predetermined by some obscure subjective governmental and cultural factors...).

Gifted kids seem to be able to fulfil theirs needs happily only in wealthy families as they can provide lot of stimulation (high quality private schools, activities, traveling...) that are usually too expensive here for low and middle incomes households.  


But I guess it is pretty common in all countries? 

Regarding gifted adults, well... Most if not all the ones I know left the country as the result of the reasons above, mainly to USA, Canada and Australia where they find much more opportunities to bloom and are much happier.

I am curious if any of you experience any similar observations / interpretations?",0
"Giftedness and work Hi everyone,

I saw that people talk very little here about one of the most important aspects of life - the workplace - so it will be interesting to open a new post about it.
Various surveys show us that gifted people tend to be very successful in professional life - their salary is usually way above the national average and they tend to fulfill career goals. Nevertheless, it seems that besides the successful majority, there is also a notable minority of gifted underachievers - people who don't like their work, struggle financially, occasionally unemployed, or just working in a place that is way behind their potential abilities.
So in your opinion, what are the main causes for some gifted people underachieving? Which obstacles to promotion tend to happen? And which working environments or professions can be really friendly for gifted people (besides the obvious places like universities)? Do you think that in your culture gifted underachieving is rare or makes a significant minority?
It will be great also to hear your personal stories.",0
"Giftedness and knowledge My experience is that I need relatively few facts or data points and very little time to have a basic understanding of things, where I can produce “guesstimates” that seemingly have value for others. And I am able to communicate them in a way that people seem to believe what I am saying. 

This is troubling for me, in the sense that I know I know next to nothing about the topic, there is no depth, yet people are convinced and satisfied. I feel like I’m bluffing my way through life without real knowledge. I do read a lot but there is no topic that I really know every aspect of in depth. 

Are all people conscious that we are walking around bullshitting each other constantly in this way on some level? 

I feel like I need a long time to learn something in depth, to truly understand it. However the time requirement is the opposite of productivity so I have to create output when my inputting has barely started because of the expectation of productivity.

I started a job in a new field once (one that I did not train for or get an education in, but wanted to get into) and about a month in I got the feedback that they had expected to see a greater contribution from me by then, but I was still taking in and processing the company, the culture, the field, my role, office dynamics etc then. I was a bit disappointed in myself but then it only took me a week more for things to “click into place”. Started as a temp for an entry level position and was promoted to manager within a year. I was able to make very quick assessments and decisions at this point, but still felt like I was seriously lacking in true knowledge. 

How come I can get a career out of basic googling skills/ reading a couple of Wikipedia articles? I knew nothing about anything but everyone was satisfied and colleagues gave me the feedback that I was inspiring to work with. 

Knowing how often I change my mind and perspective of something as I gain more knowledge, the idea of anyone listening to my opinion and making decisions based on it frankly scares me. 

I don’t think this is related to impostor syndrome in the sense that I don’t believe everybody else has that much more knowledge than me. It just feels like we’re all bullshitting each other. Emperor’s new clothes or something like that, where we are all the emperor.",0

"Gifted but with average test scores? My kindergarten son is FAR ahead of the rest of his class on reading and math- he’s reading chapter books and doing 3 digit addition/subtraction and negative numbers. He was tested at age 2.5 as part of an evaluation for early intervention and at that point he tested as super ahead in several areas (like scoring as high as a 6 or 7 year old) and the teachers were the first ones to label him as “gifted”. But at his kindergarten testing his scores were in the 70th and 80th percentiles - I have heard a lot criticism of this specific test they do at his school, but I’m not sure what the criticisms are. But this was a lot lower than we were expecting based on his previous testing and what we are seeing as far as his abilities. 

He doesn’t have any learning disabilities that we know of- there is a chance he could have ADHD (my husband and I do, so he’s got the genetic tendencies) but honestly he seems to really excel at the hyper focus part and rarely struggles to concentrate.  

But I’m not sure how to advocate for him if his tests scores are more average.  I was the opposite of him and got test scores in the 98th/99th percentile most of the time but struggled with concentrating and keeping up in school. He is starting to get more bored in school being so far ahead- for a while the new environment and social aspect kept him entertained enough but now that’s wearing off and we’re starting to see some (very minor) behavioral issues that I want to get ahead of. I want to start out with a good plan next school year to keep him engaged in school but I’m worried the teachers won’t see any need if his scores on paper don’t support it. 

Does anyone have any experience with average test scores not related to a learning disability? Or how to advocate for your kids educational needs in the absence of very high scores?",0

He can count to 20, he's known his abc's and can recognize each letter since before he was 2. He knows all of his shapes. He memorizes the words to songs almost instantly and then will sing them all day with impressive pitch. The only thing he ever wants to play with is puzzles. His attention span is weird as he can sit in his room and ""read"" his books for hours. Hes also very attentive to his surrounding and will ofteb point things out to me or make connections that I would have never noticed. (Ex. He found three hair ties, arranged them and said ""look, it's mickey mouse"", he saw an orange camero with a black stripe in a parking lot and proclaimed it the ""Nemo car"").

"Anyone else feel like they consume information slowly? I thought this was just a weird quirk of mine, until recently, I spoke to someone with very similar experiences. Both of us felt the need the need to pace around after consuming only small amounts of knowledge, like a few paragraphs/pages in a book, and if we didn't do so we'd get frustrated, irritated, confused, and wouldn't fully comprehend or remember whatever knowledge we'd consumed. Additionally, more specifically, we'd both envision ourselves explaining things we were trying to understand to people. All of this made us very inefficient learners, although we had no issue applying or manipulating abstract knowledge we'd already learned.

In fact my husband, who is an engineer and regularly called a genius, is the only one to treat me like I'm just as smart as him.

"Kendrick Lamar exudes giftedness I have had a suspicion for the longest time that Kendrick is definitely a gifted person, and he released a song on his newest album where he talks about seeing his giftedness as a young child. To some, this is probably obvious, but I wanted to post this to talk about the way he embodies it. 

I think Kendrick has an amazing grasp on what it means to be gifted, and what it means to live a fulfilling life as a gifted person. He describes an intense struggle on Good Kid Maad City of feeling isolated and different from his peers as well as the pressure to live a certain lifestyle. I think he begins to display his gift and use it extraordinarily well on To Pimp a Butterfly with his insane lyricism and loud, jazzy production which is symbolic of his newfound confidence in his gift. He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone anymore, at this point, Kendrick is one of the greatest alive at what he does and he knows it. This album is so influential, in fact, that many begin to praise it as the greatest hiphop album of all time. I think DAMN starts to reflect on the emotional struggles and intensity of being gifted although other themes are definitely present like all of his other albums.

This is what I love about Kendrick and his development as an artist. He's always seeking to go further and to reflect with more honesty. He shows a constant desire to adapt and improve and this is a huge part of giftedness in my opinion. Not to mention the undeniably deep connection that his thoughts and feelings share. 

On his most recent album, he takes the depth of his music further by describing the struggle of being seen as a prophet or some person to worship, and I think this is very reminiscent of giftedness and living up to the expectation of always being the best.  I think Kendrick's discography perfectly describes the journey of a gifted individual in an environment where giftedness is not widely accepted or nurtured (you could even make parallels here to tupac's Tu Pimp a Caterpillar and Kendrick growing and becoming the butterfly, hence to pimp a butterfly).",0
"To be or not to be that is the question. Hi all, I'm not sure why I'm writing this, since probably nobody is going to read it, but I had the impulse to write something about this topic and share my opinion with any other human being who's willing to read and comment on it. I hope there is no character limit on the post because I'm going to absolutely smash the fuck out the character count. I could have written this in any other subreddit (like r/psychology) but I felt this was the appropiate one. And please do not hesitate to reply if you have lived something similar or feel somehow related to me.

I'm now 26 years old and I probably do qualify as ""gifted"" for today's standards, even though I've never done an IQ test and never will, because I think they are complete bs. You all are intelligent enough (pun intended) to guess that no test can judge the intelligence of a person based on weird random logical patterns. But since I was a kid I knew there was something a bit different in me. It is some sort of cosmic radiation that most people have in a really small percentage that yet I seem to have in a higher concentration. How easy it was for me to think abstract concepts and connect ideas it was not average, even though I though that at the beginning everybody could do so. I'm also one of those weird XNTP (on the logical side of the Meyers briggs) (even though I think Mayer bricks is bs too) As you can guess I have a really weird relationship with psychology. Yeah, since I was a kid I've been to many psychologists because my parents couldn't really understand me and I had an extreme vivid imagination that was always crafting stories about evil witches, blood thirsty monsters and anything extreme that implied some kind of heroic act. To be honest when I was 4 years old my dream was to climb mount Everest and lose a hand on the way up. A bit weird if you ask most people. I also had trouble falling asleep and imagined there were always monsters lurking below my bed, especilly velociraptors, those fuckers had me completely frightened at night.

In the beggining I used to be a happy kid playing football (real football, not the melon shaped ball that americans play) and I was pretty good at it but I would sometimes be hit by abstract concepts and wonder about the essence of the universe and the existence of free will... while I was in the middle of a football game. Later I discovered that the other kids weren't really into metaphysical paradoxes but rather about capturing Pikachus (Hey I was into that too).  I've always felt sometimes like an alien that comes from another planet and tries to blend with people. I've always been downgrading my vocabulary (in my native language) just to fit in and I've never felt that I belonged in any group. I do have friends that come from all sorts of places all of them with different ways of living and political opinions but I don't belong to any of them. One day I can go and see my friend that works in a consulting firm in a 9 to 5 job and talk about the current economy and the minimum wage and have great fun and another day I can go and smoke a joint with my friend that is triying to survive selling stuff on the streets.

In today's society we tend to idealize intelligence as the far superior trait any other person could have.  But please, let me explain the reasons why we might be falling short here.

I've met 2 really intelligent persons in my life with an IQ above 160 (maybe I've met others but I didn't know) One of them is working in a public school earning minimum wage, and the other one killed herself. I don't think people really realize the consequences that implies being gifted.

For those who have seen the movie ""interview with the vampire"" probably remember what the journalists tells the vampire at the end of the movie. The vampire ""Tom Cruise"" after explaining the sheer amount of pain and suffering he has had to endure for the last 400 years living off rats because he could not tolerate the death of another human. And yer the first thing the journalist who is interviewing him asks is: ""please, can you bite me and turn me into you""? 

Nowadays most kids qualify in school and are denominated as a child with: ""high capabilities"". Now everybody seems to have high capacities. I think there is a big difference between being intelligent and beeing gifted. Being gifted ""really gifted"" is a curse, not a gift. Being gifted is racing with a rocket in a horse race. Being gifted is feeling like an outsider and an alien for most part of your life. Being gifted is perfectly understanding the rules of the game and yet being unable to participate in the game. Life is an illusion folks, and like any other show that you attend you have to make a suspension of your disbelief. Regular people can do that. Lately I can't. Living is believing that love exists and not thinking that is just another engine of nature to replace yourself (BTW i believe love exists). Living is believing that we live in the best of the possible worlds and not really thinking about how we are just another pawn controlled by the system. We are pawns, but yet some are more self conscious that others that we are pawns.

We are bound and doomed to happiness not to intelligence. 

But there is something far greater than intelligence, something that soothes your troubled mind and inspires awe. And that is wisdom. Intelligent people are not wise. Wise people know that reasons are reasons but at the end a house built in the middle of the desert is not worth living. We are bound to where the river flows and where the fresh flowers grows. I've seen both. And I can tell you that intelligence is one of the most overrated concepts our society has been investing in. 

If you have a higher percentage of the pie, you also have more chances to get a rotten piece. And by rotten piece I mean some sort of mental disorder. If you think you are gifted and you have never stumbled across any of the common disorders like ""anxiety"", ""depression"", ""ocd"" etc, you probably aren't gifted and you should be so happy. Now, as I have told before I do not consider myself as gifted I'm just above average probably and a weird human being that get's bored easily with everything he does. 

What do you guys think? Are we really rasing a false god called intelligence? Or we should really keep believing in all this ""progress"" thing and we should continue to pay our bills to the ""intelligent idols"" like Elon Musk and be ready to pack our stuff to go to Mars? For me being gifted is understanding your own limits and being able to really live your life to the fullest remembering that at the end we are only a bunch of monkeys that are playing to be God.",0
"Lack of empathy for First World problems? This could have something to do with the supposed 'hypersensitivity' gifted people have. We're meant to be more sensible to the world that surrounds us, as well as informed on the whole about general affairs. Here's a lead-in question: do any of you feel like you know so much about the world than the average person, and therefore fail to empathise with first-world problems?

In my case, I live in a first-world country where only a minimal percentage of the population suffers from homelessness/extreme poverty. Nevertheless, there's a huge amount of others living in poorer countries where there's not even basic infrastructure for them to have clean water, let alone electricity, with only dirt roads between town and town, whose lives are incomparable to those of us lucky enough to have internet access.

It just baffles me that everyone here takes everything for granted, all of the time. Psychologists have come up with labels for mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and every year there's more and more diagnoses. Many can't even stomach the thought of spending more than ten minutes without their phone readily available. Some complain because ""the Wi-Fi doesn't work"" or ""Instagram is down for maintenance"". In the field of academics, there's the typical guy who cries because his mental health depends on a grade from A+ to F, and won't accept anything less than a B. Additionally, (I don't want to get political but so be it), the ""I am offended"" tropes from both sides of the debate have gotten into the most intense fighting in decades and negatively affect every country they're in. This entitledness is so deeply ingrained, (I think) mainly due to ignorance, that the new Generation, also dubbed the Crystal Generation, is widely considered to be the weakest in history.

So whenever I am told about how 'bad' or 'horrible' a situation is, or hear someone acting like any of the abovementioned, I genuinely can't feign I see it as a real problem. My natural reaction (in my mind) is: ""Well, it could be a lot worse. You're better off than 80% of humanity, just because you were born here.  Why don't you instead stop crying and be grateful for everything you actually have?""

Anybody relate or have a differing perspective to offer? May giftedness play a part in this way of thinking?

TL;DR: Those of us in the West are better off than 80% than humanity just because we were born here, yet we have the most mental health issues, suicides and 'first world problems', while people in underdeveloped countries may not even have the most basic infrastructure like clean water, but are more mentally stable. I posit that our people are too entitled and therefore I, personally, can't understand 'first world problems', knowing the aforementioned.",0

"What exactly is giftedness (from a scientific pov)? What is giftedness? Is it the same as high intelligence? (I'm not associating high intelligence with IQ because IQ is usually measured by IQ tests and they are very misleading imo. I'm talking about high intelligence from a more subjective view- including artistic and creative intelligence)

Is it having a high intelligence but also displaying certain traits than not everyone with a high IQ would? If yes, then does everyone who is ""gifted"" have high intelligence? Are there people with high intelligence who are not gifted? Given that we don't even have a solid reliable way of measuring intelligence, what can we even say for sure?

Scientifically speaking, what qualifies as giftedness?

I know that giftedness is more encompassing than intelligent because it also includes other areas like music, dance, etc. that intelligence, in the more typical sense doesn't. But other than that, what is the difference between the two?

Note: I am not trying to say that giftedness doesn't exist or anything. I'm sorry if it comes across as that. I, a supposedly gifted person myself, only recently discovered the term gifted and what it entails. And I have so many questions. All of this is out of pure curiosity.",0
"Research on high intelligence and correlation with ADHD/ dyslexia/ autism/ Aspergers and different aspects of intelligence? So I have recently fallen down a rabbit hole of intelligence and the science behind it. I am fascinated but am running out of content? lol.

Also on the link between high intelligence and performance in different facets of intelligence?- for eg) how is reasoning linked with high intelligence as opposed to critical thinking, etc. Just something that explores the different aspects of intelligence and how they are correlated.

Also the science of intelligence in general, like what parts of the brain tell us what about intelligence?

"Accounting for Practice Effect I only took one real IQ test, in my early childhood, and barely made it past 2 SD to get into the gifted program. But I'm realizing that my score is practically invalid. They say you can't retake the WAIS within six months because of practice effect, but I had done practice questions for two weeks leading up to my IQ test, so I'm terrified that my IQ is actually much lower. Now idk how to figure out if I was really +2 SD or if I was one of those dummies who weaseled their way in despite not really belonging there. When I was being assessed the question formats were very familiar, maybe I wouldn't have made it in if I didn't have that unfair advantage. I was given practice to get in and then they bought their own lie when I did, but why did they give me the practice if I was really gifted? Why did I barely make it in even with the advantage of practice?

I know many of you like to crap on intelligence and giftedness. But it's very important to me that I'm smart. So please just humor me. Maybe it doesn't matter to you but to me the idea that I'm not smart is very scary. I'm not good at anything else, and even the best-case scenario of 130 IQ isn't that high, so if I'm even lower than that then idk what to do. I need to be smart, I'm not content with being incapable and you can't convince me to be. Please just humor me.

I don't think I can do another real test because I've been doing too many online ones for the result to be valid. But I need to know my IQ. What studies are there on practice effect and the ability of practice tests to get non-gifted children into gifted programs?

"Does anyone's learning have a rhythm? I don't know what else to call it but for me it seems I sometimes get into something and you could call it a flow state but there is also a momentum too. Maybe that's the natural building up of knowledge over time but sometimes it can happen very quickly. It has to do with sustained attention I think.

I went to a school with a lot of gifted kids and there was this energy sometimes for some of them. Like I guess you could call it an excitability. Like the importance of what was being learned was growing with the understanding. I couldn't understand exactly what was driving that importance.

So do any of you actively find a rhythm or groove to get into where learning can compound faster.

For me right now it seems it's about getting as deep into the nuts and bolts of things as possible, as well as many other things. I feel like there are a lot of pathways to use here.",0
"I can control my dreams Hey everyone.



Ever since I was a kid I dreamt VIVID dreams. I would see snakes and insects around my bed right when I woke up. It wasn’t until I got baptized a couple years ago when I started lucid dreaming. I can control my dreams almost every night. I am aware I’m dreaming, and I can change buildings, fly, and make things appear (such as animals, water, books). I usually dream of spirits and possessions. Almost every dream has a possessed person, and I’m praying over them. I sometimes see my physical body when I’m dreaming, and I feel like I’m shifting from different realities. I know that sounds crazy. I just had a lucid dream last night, these two children were sitting on the couch and I looked at them. I said “I know this is a dream and I’m dreaming.” They looked at me as if I wasn’t supposed to say that. It was a bit freaky. Also, whenever I wake up there’s a few seconds of me seeing spiders and insects around me.
It’s not only dreams, but whenever I randomly think of someone, a few days later I find out something happened to them. This has happened quite a few times. For example, I thought of a person, and then couple days later I find out they’re pregnant or they passed away. I sometimes think of people I haven’t talked to for years, and that happens. I don’t know what any of this means. Maybe it’s a coincidence idk. 

Any thoughts or advice?",0
"Trying to figure out just how smart I am and I feel so lost **Introduction**

1) **I am 15 and have been considered a ""good"" or ""smart"" student all along (but nothing toooo crazy- very smart at best). Before I go on, it's important to take note of the fact that I have ADHD (and depression) and I basically have spent my entire life (not exaggerating) procrastinating and have never really shown any signs of** ***exceptional*** **intelligence like reading books way higher for my level or delving into fascinating unknown topics instead of studying.**

 Yeah, no, none of that. Guess what I did for almost 15 years straight? Kept browsing and scrolling through random bs on yt, reddit, etc. And I'm not talking things that ignite a curiosity in me- just random bs that I didn't even really want to read or watch over half of the time. Now that I think, it was more of a way of passing time because I reallyyyy didn't want to study (can't even pinpoint a reason because it has been this way ever since i can remember and idr why because i was way too young and then it just became a habit- although I do know that a couple months ago, the first time ever, I was trying to study not just a couple hour before exams, I found just the thought of it very overwhelming. But before that I didn't even try studying, so I wasn't really overwhelmed by them as such? idk if you get what i mean?)

2) **So I basically managed school by cramming a couple hours before the exam because when I am that stressed my adhd seems to magically vanish and managed 95+ up till 7th grade and around 90 sometimes less, after.**

My teachers and peers seem to think I'm intelligent because I participate a lot- mostly just ask questions and for some subjects that I kind of like- take a lot of notes. A lot of my peers and teachers think I slog for hours at an end everyday because of the first impression they formed of me in the beginning from initial classes and that almost makes the whole thing worse.

**Argument - For**

1) So the main reason I ever even started considering the possibility of being gifted was because of my **ability to analyse complex nuanced situations** in **great depth** and **high emotional intelligence** (namely because of my ability to analyse my own actions in the same depth as I do with other situations, introspection, questioning my bias, etc.)

2) I also LOVEEE analysing interesting nuanced topics and especially love discussing such things with people who can also do the same. I legit live for those **conversations**. I do tend to gravitate more towards **sociology, psychology and philosophy** than more technical topics.

3) Kind of similar but I want to group all similar points together, so excuse me if this seems too dragged out. Either way, **I think too much and it comes fairly naturally to me and I do it for every tiny little thing subconsciously**, could just be my overthinking nature rather than iq tho.

4) **I am pretty curious about everything and anything**. The problem though arises in maintaining that curiosity, which I'll get to later.

5) **The very few times I have been more or less focused, my memory/retention power was fairly good. But take this with a pinch of salt, because this has only happened a couple times and I don't have anything to compare to.** I just know that I had this one moment, one day when my focus happened to be good that ""ohmygod I can memorize so easily???? I just need to understand and read properly, say it over and over in my head, and then after I'm done with the whole thing (eg-1 chap or wtv my target is) I just need to go over the everything multiple times really quickly, for about half an hour or an hour max. I knew adhd impaired my ability but by this much????"". But here's the problem, I may have overestimated my memorization abilities because I was used to shit memory as I was constantly distracted. So maybe this just looked rosy in comparison. Maybe there are a lot of people who can memorize as well, I don't think it was anything out of the blue. Not to mention, the fact that I have no clue about the avg person's memorization ability doesn't exactly help.

6) **Verbal intelligence?** I am supposedly very good at explaining complex topics with words. But I don't personally give a lot of weightage to this point. The point in itself is true but at the same time, I don't have a great vocab and in general am not as good with words as some people are.

**Argument- Against**

1) **Don't know if I'm good at, anything other than analysing complex situations, like reasoning, understanding concepts, etc.**

2) **I am not as driven or motivated as gifted kids are.**

3) **I lose curiosity** after a day of falling into a rabbit hole that, for a whole day, fulfilled me like nothing else. I cannot channel my curiosity like most gifted people can.

**Conclusion**

Possible theories-

**1) I am a bit intelligent but not enough to be gifted.**

**2) I am exceptionally intelligent but only when it comes to analysis in depth and not with other things.**

**So according to you am I intelligent or not? if yes, what area? Is it possible to be really good in one area but fairly average when it comes to others?**",0

Since i've been young it seems like i always need some form of stimulation, everything from learning to listning to music. - It seems like it serve no purpose other then me getting satisfied.

"What should I do with my summer? After 12 years attending the same private school 12 miles away from my home, I (M17) will soon finish this chapter of my life. Or should I rather say, prologue? I was diagnosed as gifted at age 7, and my life has been rather uneventful all througout. This school I've attended had at most 50 students in my grade, and whilst in the past I used to have friends, in the recent years they've been replaced by drug-addicts, nihilists, generally unpleasant and useless people you wouldn't want to share your life with.

That being said, I feel as though I have thrown away my entire childhood and adolescence. I barely ever went out with friends when I had them (thanks to distance, mainly) and as previously stated, they all left the school anyway so that left me all alone with nonsensical, hedonist youngsters with whom I could never relate to. Sometimes, I wish I were as reckless and careless about life as my counterparts. In truth, I have no good memories of having fun with friends (outside of school, that is) and I spend several hours every day doing absolutely nothing. Literally, I just sit down and talk to myself for hours on end. Don't we all here, though?

My hobbies do not fill me and consist of: reading about everything, keeping up with the latest political news, lurking on Reddit and Quora, watching YouTube about anything, learning foreign languages, engaging in discussions with people, gossiping, laughing about others' misery whilst denying my own and playing videogames.

The truth of the matter is I am virtually alone. I genuinely envy children who go to the public school in front of my house, and those who are members of the local football club from a young age - I literally have 0 contacts in my own town. Only the same 50 guys I've had to tolerate for years. It really kills me to see other early adults having the time of their lives while I'm here as if on house arrest all day long. My real problem is I barely ever meet new people.

But everything is about to change. Adulthood is fast approaching, and so is what many have fantasized as my ""last free summer"" before university. In my mind, though, I know it will be just like the others: I will waste countless hours doing unfulfilling things that will amount to nothing. From my point of view, I have hit rock bottom, and the only way my life can turn is up. My life philosophy is that, while I may be losing a battle, I will win the war so long as I don't give up, because I genuinely believe in myself, and I just know that after September, I am guaranteed to succeed and meet people who I'll find agreeable.

So I guess my question would be, how can I make the most out of the next 3 months of summer? How can I meet locals around my age during summer? Should I do anything special to prepare for university? What do you all do in your free time?

TL;DR: Gifted M17 has no friends and is going to university after summer. Needs advice on how to survive the monotony of having nothing to do for 3 months.",0
"Why do most people seem to have a competitive nature to them? I've been reflecting on my conversations with most people and I noticed this pattern with most people. Anytime I bring up something that I'm working on (new ideas, creative projects, plans, new skills) then people seem to think that I am trying to be competitive with them. It's like I can't just share what I'm doing without something taking my self improvement as a personal attack at them. I guess it comes down to this. 

I share information and current events in my life as a way to be personable, friendly, and open to another person. It's like my way of letting them in my life, a form of vulnerability. But it seems like most people only share information to appear a certain way, very ego based and focused. 

I just want to scream that I don't care about any of that. I care about bettering myself and working towards the future. I don't care about social status, reputation, and competition. Why do most people care so much about meaningless things? I just don't get it. I know it has to do with ego development.

"Learning isn’t fun anymore I feel like being labeled “smart” stops me from enjoying the learning process. Whenever I do anything and impress people with my skillset or experience, they then expect impressively high levels of achievement constantly. I’m held to a much higher standard than others — despite having less formal training or education due to my background and income. And people seem incredulous whenever I make a human error, don’t know the answer, or I’m too exhausted or sick to do intellectual backflips that day. Its like some people think I’m some kind of human knowledge machine.

I feel like I then can’t simply enjoy the learning process. It’s no fun because once people decide you’re gifted at one thing — or worse, gifted at several — they start expecting a performance each time they see you, shove you in leadership roles, teaching roles, and it starts to feel like a job rather than just something you just wanted to do for leisure — just like everyone else. It also bothers me that society tends to expect perfection just because you demonstrate knowledge, talent or skill.

"Do you get weird dreams that teach you things? Often I have dreams that are very symbolic. They are super intense and dramatic to the point that I'll wake up remembering everything that happened in them. Even the conversations and random things that appear. The crazy part is that I'll be ""Conscious"" in these dreams too. Like my inner monologue is the same when I'm awake and asleep in the dream world.

Last night though, it was one of those dreams that was especially intense. One of the conversations that I had was with my mother. I don't know why but I started arguing with her. She had told me something that triggered an anger inside of me. I told her ""You wonder why all of your kids are leaving you and don't love you. Well this is why. These are the things that you do that make it so hard to love you.""

After I said that, she started to completely degrade me. Pointing out my insecurities, failed romantic relationships, and even told me that all I was good for was to be manipulated and used by people. That's when she pointed out how none of my old friends ever respected me.

I told her, ""You wonder why I never had real relationships? It was because you never showed me what healthy love looked like and so I took scraps for love. It was always your fault for my abuse.""

She stopped and told me to look into her eyes. It was weird. I looked and her eyes were blackened. The more I stared, it was like I saw other spirits inside of her. A reptilian-like demon was inside of her and it morphed her face temporarily. Then the soul of a previous abusive friend entered her after. It was like my mom was there physically but not in spirit. Just pure darkness.

We stopped arguing because my sister was in the other room and started breaking down from everything that she heard. My sister was so angry that my mom told me all of that.

But it was really weird.

After she calmed down, she came over to me to tell me something. It was her physically but not her spirit. It was someone else inside of her body. She said this,

""Standing up for yourself was good but I have one question. Do you fight to win or do you fight to prove?""

Dream ends.

I had to reflect on this all morning.

All of those spirits that entered my mother were people who I always felt the need to prove myself to. I had to prove how strong I am. And so I would fight to prove my strength. And another part of me wants to always win to show that I am not weak.

I think this is what I am being asked to let go of.

I don't need to prove myself to anyone. I don't need to win.

This dream was so emotionally triggering for me. Once I realized that the argument with my mother was about myself feeling the need to prove myself, I literally couldn't stop crying.

Anyone else relate to these weird type of dreams. Also, sorry for the long post.",0
"Is it normal to feel as if my IQ test results are wrong? Hi,when I was in the psych ward due to some mental problems they tested my IQ and I found out I have an IQ of 137 with peaks of 141 in IVE and IRP.

They basically told me I was ""gifted"" etc.

I,however, don't think I am ig? I suck at maths and also in my family I think I'm the dumbest

How probable is it that they got my test wrong? 

(also sorry if my english is wrong it isn't my  first language)",0
"Has anyone else completely derailed their life? I'm pretty much alone and mentally ill all of the time. I keep busy with ""personal projects"" lol but if I'm being honest, they don't fulfill me. Sometimes I'll get so wrapped up in something only to realize I've learned what I want to learn and it's not going to get me anywhere... which I know on one hand doesn't matter, but I'm directionless. I've probably developed an unhealthy level of maladaptive daydreaming to live in due to this ""lifestyle.""

There's just something inside of me that has *completely* disintegrated and I don't know if I'm capable of getting it back. I'm a living blob, but my mind is never silent and that's a problem because I feel like I can't get to a clear place of reset. I have absolutely zero energy to do most basic tasks, but crave stimulation, and I carry around a contradictory empty weight all of the time. I force myself to leave my house and then I need to be alone with my thoughts. I sit at home and ruminate and can't really reach the full extent of my thoughts, projects, experiences, or goals. I push things, I push them incredibly far because I subconsciously calculate how I can get out of them, and then I don't... but then I find a way, so I'm constantly hanging onto to this very fragile, teetering space of life where I'm not really living. It's hard to feel moved by anything anymore because I'm constantly snatching up the little pieces that I can get.

There is a wall. I think I have a catch-22 mental block of feeling like I'm old and wasted all of the time that was meant for me to develop myself and my life. I'm 25 and I just can't believe I am the way I am. I feel worthless and pathetic, and it's not just about accomplishments. I just feel like I haven't been and can't be who I could be, and who I want to be. The straightforward answer would be to make those changes. Even though I contemplate all of the potential directions I could go in detail, I can't execute them because of various reasons, which sounds like an excuse and I guess it is. The pandemic has also been a complete mindfuck in terms of time. I've spent a good chunk of what was supposed to be a formative time inside, breeding and fostering this ridiculous mindset.

I used to be social but now most social interactions are quite painful internally. I feel the need to fib to most people about myself and what I'm doing, just to cover up the fact that I'm the biggest disappointment of everyone I know, although it's pretty obvious. I'm the sad example of someone we've all watched go downhill for a while, occasionally bopping up and excelling for a short period of time, but never really thriving.

The only thing I can hang onto for any small sort of self-preservation is the fact that I know I can be capable and I believe that there is something that's ""worth it."" I have barely anything to show for it, so it's pretty near worthless, but I'm able to learn and understand and appreciate the underlying beauty in things. I just also... can't *do*? There is a huge block in my mind that zaps me of energy to do much of anything. So that's where I am. Hanging onto this small glimmer of hope that's probably based on something I don't really have, or may not exist.",0

"Intense emotions I (22F) went to a therapist a while ago and she told me I am gifted after talking for only ten minutes. I took the Mensa test and scored 131 (made it very quick and wasn’t serious about it). 

I have always felt different, but never really struggled with making friends. I can adapt to people, but often have to hold myself in (funfacts, corrections, talking slower, etc). I can be surrounded by friends, but still feel alone. 

I am also very emotional. I struggle with our society because there are many things I don’t understand. Maybe I rationalise too much. But I keep wondering why people do what they do, especially people my age. They drink a lot, do drugs, have sex with people they don’t even love and like to play ‘cool’, for example by driving recklessly or throwing trash on the streets. Many aspects of society, like fashion, i do not understand. I think it is hypocrite. I love animals and I am not even able to hurt a spider (i put them outside). I am also quickly overstimulated. I had a mental breakdown at a festival last week because it caused my faith in humanity to drop drasticly and i can’t even explain what was going on in my head at that moment. I cried and I was shaking. I went home and made a puzzle, by myself, which everyone thought was weird but i really enjoyed.

I tend to think that this world is simply too cruel for me. Maybe it is part of being gifted, idk. 

I also struggle with finding a boyfriend, especially because I don’t feel a real connection with anyone. I dated a lot but never felt anything. I simply don’t care about looks, I just want someone that actually cares as much as I do, and someone who is intelligent. Someone who also likes to go to museums and likes to expand their knowledge. However, this is hard to find. There is one guy I really like, he is also gifted and very depressed atm. 

I am curious about your experiences with this.",0
"Losing giftedness during teen years...? I am a 14 yo boy. I was labelled as ""gifted"" when I was 10, when my primary school nominated me and two other student to an organisation called ""HKAGE"" (if you would like to google that?) and I was told that I am ""gifted in science/maths"". For most of my last few years in my primary school (or elementary school for the other ppl who use that term?), I have always been good at science (not so much for maths though). 

Then my years in secondary school (or middle school), I got full mark once in a school science exam (but I am used to getting objectively ""good grades"")  and I am used to ppl asking me help for science or computing homework (usually just programming stuff). and then covid and puberty hit, I became bit more lazy, spending my time watching youtube, watching tv etc. I mean, I am still the few that answer question during the days of online school in maths/science/computing lesson but overall, I became more lazy.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I moved from Hong Kong to UK. Got into a public school. Getting around 90% in maths, science, computing and music (I play flute and violin). However, I failed one of my maths exam, so I moved from top ability set math class to second top set. This made me becoming more and more insecure about my intelligence. I continued to learn, I learned calculus, linear algebra, quantum physics (learned bit when I was 10 though) etc. I thought that would make me feel better.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with social anxiety, selective mutism (probably autism too according to my parents). and because of this, I struggle to communicate with ppl. Therefore, I have no friend at all. And also, sometimes I felt frustrated having to wait for others in Maths class. 

In 2022, I did a Mensa Home IQ test and I got around 118 IQ (but the test is for adults though). Given the fact that giftedness is defined as those who have IQ of higher than 130 (sometimes higher but not often to be lower). Does this indicate that my giftedness is ""disappearing""?  It is also worth noting that I never did a proper in my life, I was ""diagnosed"" by my school that I am gifted. 

&#x200B;

so the question is:

1. am I losing my giftedness?
2. if so, how can I maintain it?
3. or am I even gifted in the first place...?
4. approach to making friends that can match my intellectual needs?

"Have the option to opt out of gifted, but can't I've just found out that I'm eligible to leave the gifted program and the pain that it has brought me. However, it requires parental consent. My father agrees, however my mother will not budge. Her argument is that it will help me in my future life, but I honestly don't care about it if it's affecting my sanity. It's extremely stressful and takes too much work to be worth it.

What do I do? I need a good argument or proof that leaving the gifted program has helped people. I want to opt completely out of the gifted program, not change it. What do I do to try to convince my mother to let me leave the gifted program?",0
