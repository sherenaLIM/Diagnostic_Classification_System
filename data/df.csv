**So, /r/aspergers, what projects do you have on the go right now? Any ideas on the backburner for one reason or another? Any ideas just in the planning phase?** Even if you are working on them with someone else, they still apply here. If you can mention the interest that you have that relates to the project, that would be great; it may help others.",1
"I need to prepare both mentally and physically for a long time just to go on a casual outing. Can you relate? The only time I agree to go out with people is when I have been given a lot of notice. Even if it’s just a casual outing that seems like nbd to most people. 

For example I am going with my SO to his friends house for a dink in a few days and I can’t stop thinking about it. What am I going to wear? How will I respond if they ask me this question or that question? I prepare to meet friends like I’m preparing to go for an interview (don’t even get me started about how I prepare for an actual interview) I feel this is not normal. I’m new to this sub.

Also, if I run into someone spontaneously like someone visits without telling me or I see someone out and about or my husband forgets to tell me that someone’s coming by - I am a completely different person, like I don’t know how to socialize and I am so awkward. I’ve even hidden in the bathroom or bedroom a few times and told my husband to say I’m not home. I feel horrible and like I am so fucked up for this. If I’m forced to interact I feel like they think I’m a completely different person from when I have had time to prepare",1
"I hate TikTok Autism clout-chasers   All these people on TikTok who claim Autism in their bios and some of the parents or Autistic children on these media sites make me sick. Both faking Autism or using it as a cash platform is so perverse. It is not great, it is not enlightening, it is not a blessing. For most afflicted people it is a terrible thing to live with and absolutely debilitating at the least. You get a few of us with Aspergers who MAYBE get lucky and have a decent outcome but even then it’s worse because we have the symptoms that disrupt our way of life while simultaneously being self-aware enough to see that we are not normal which is an existential tragedy. If you’re someone who’s faking it or a parent who’s trying to make themselves feel self-righteous in a narcissistic manner in which you have a narcissistic God-complex competing with other parents to elevate your status then I hope you feel very bad about yourself.",1
"Anyone have trouble sleeping because of a hyper active brain? It's not just falling asleep at night. When I wake in the middle of the night, I just start thinking about random things. The only things that worked in the past (benadryll nightly, which I think was really bad for me in the long term), xanax/lunesta. Melatonin helps sometimes, and that only helped me fall asleep, not stay asleep.

I do all the right sleep hygiene except for one thing: I need to watch/listen to something to fall asleep. I have tried so many times without it, but I just lie away for hours. Listening to a podcast stops my active brain. It's like my thoughts get drowned out by hearing something else.

I have mild sleep apnea, CPAP doesn't do anything for me. Was never diagnosed with central apnea or anything. My latest ENT seems to think I'm not worth looking into, because I'm not overweight, and my AHI is low (around 6).

But I really suspect that I have something neurological going on. Are there neuro sleep specialists? I had my diagnosis of aspergers in 2020, but she said I didn't have ADHD.

EDIT: Wow, I'm so happy this sub is so active and responsive! Thanks everyone!",1
"How would you feel if someone told you, regarding your special interest, ""You are weird and obsessed""? It is a sincere question.

"Autism is a curse and I hate having something that ruined my life. It is NOT and NEVER will be a gift so stop sugarcoating it. But if you had different and better experiences, then good for you. The last subreddit I posted this venting story, a lot of people there in the autism community were happy with themselves with the condition and that's good for them. However, I think very differently; I'm not glad to be born with this condition at all. Be honest with me in the comments: if you were all given a choice to be normal or disabled, would you choose the latter at all? You can call me an ableist all you want, but I am ripping on everybody including NTs and autistics and this is my story:

(I know that this story is very long, but if you wish to make any type of commentary, then please just read from the beginning all the way up to the end.)

I was diagnosed at 3 or 4 and ever since I got into elementary school, I was always supervised by an adult, and other kids at my school weren't. I never knew why and that answer was revealed to me in my high-functioning special ed social skills elective class during 6th grade that I have an autism disorder. Which explained why I was treated so differently during my youth by the adults at my school. This also explains why my social life sucks to this day. Whenever I go to social gatherings, I'm always considered to be awkward, I got treated like crap growing up, and so on. Autism affects every single aspect of your life and not even in a good way. In elementary, I had to go through some home session meetings after school, I was supervised during class, and I did shit academically. The first thing I mentioned about this whole home session shit and this whole gov paper shit my parents had to pay for was the reason why I wasn't able to pour my energy into meaningful extracurriculars such as sports, instruments, and so on. The only time I remember doing that was during summer break when I didn't have school, but it still felt like I was doing a lot less compared to my peers. But at least many kids in elementary were nice to me and I actually liked my peers at the time. Maybe I was just oblivious back then, but I don't care because I generally had a good relationship with my friends and I didn't hate that many people back then. Not to mention that a lot of us tend to be sensory sensitive because of the fact of how our brains are larger than neurotypicals' by 20%, and even though I have built up a lot of tolerance for that over the years, it still does feel like shit whenever I personally get yelled at by people nonetheless. Middle school came and my academics start to improve dramatically so I wanted to be in the honors program and my grades allowed for that to happen. But some of the counselors thought that I would fail and fuck up if I joined those honors classes and I had the fucking IEP that prevented me from doing that. All my teachers and this high-functioning special education teacher who followed me around during some of my classes have hyped me up about joining the honors program next year and gave me false hope about that so fuck those adults.

Because of that, I was stuck in regular classes for all three years of middle school and I was not happy with it. At my middle school, about 90% of the kids who went there were enrolled in the gifted magnet program that allowed them to be in honors classes and many of my friends there were in that very program. In fact, I only had two or three friends who weren't in that magnet program. Just like many schools, in regulars or easier classes, since it's not too hard and we're only asked to do the minimum, there were only manner-less punks who caused trouble all the time and those who didn't even want to do that very minimum. I'm not saying that everybody who is in regular classes is like that and I have met people who were in those gifted or honors classes who were total douchebags too. Maybe they were just kids back then and perhaps they didn't know better at the time. After all, it was in middle school, the place and time where they have the most toxic age group: teens. If any of you reading this is a teen in middle school, high school, or college as an 18-19-year-old, there are always people who judge you on petty bullshit, who fight, act up, gossip, and think they're better than everyone and I think you know who I am talking about. Although for college, not so much I suppose. But the magnet program at my middle school had more variety of people and I was surrounded by people who were just outright terrible only, which includes both the scummy magnet kids and the bad regulars class kids (the magnet kids and the regulars kids shared PE together), and that still affects me today to a certain extent. I also had a crush on a girl who was in that magnet program and unfortunately, I still do to this day, although it is getting weaker gradually as the year passes. I delude myself that I'll see her again in the far future and I know that'll never happen but that is the only thing that keeps me sane to this day. So I ended up knowing people from my middle school in fucking high school but those populations have only been about 1/8 of the magnet kids from middle school at the maximum and that girl I liked was not part of that 1/8.

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't find anybody new who was beautiful or my type in high school, so I didn't get over my middle school crush. Also, it is NOT that easy to find somebody else, not just because we tend to cling to what we like, but because of the fact that many of these new people may not be better in appearance, personality, and other fields than your old crush. But acceptance mostly. I don't know about how you guys judge attractiveness, but I had a crush on that girl for who she was as a person too. I'll admit that I've never talked to her too much and had very little interaction with her in 6th grade PE, but I still did hear that she was pretty chill and we knew of each other's existence. But for someone new, unless you have the same classes with her (or him if you're a girl) in high school or college, then you wouldn't interact with anybody else too much and with our below-average social skills. And besides, even if you do find someone new, what are really the chances that your new crush would like you back with that very problem anyways? Slim to none. I'm not saying that I would have gotten to know my crush in middle school better even if I did have a chance to talk to her more, but I'm just saying that if there is anyone you develop a crush on but you don't often interact with that person so much, it's just not gonna work out. Your chances get even worse when there's the fact that you haven't interacted with each other to the point that the other party doesn't even know that you exist, has not heard your name even once, and doesn't hear anything about you at all. This is more of the reason why it's so hard to find someone new. I mean, why should you even expect somebody completely new who you've only known for about a week at the most to accept you for who you are compared to your old peers who have known you for longer than a school year? Regardless of what your relationship status was with him/her. It doesn't matter if you didn't talk or interact with each other too much, or even if you guys were enemies at worst, but if you've technically known each other for that long, you usually get used to that person and their habits whether you like it or not. It's the same with people living in dangerous areas, or even seeing other weirdos at school: if you spend time with and get used to someone or something in your situation for a long time, you get used to it, and becomes natural to you regardless of how you initially felt about that matter. I hope the latter is something many others here could relate to too, cuz I'm pretty sure everyone, even autistics, has had these feelings at one point in their lives. I am not that good with words, but I am trying my best to convey this.

Surely, everybody knows that high school relationships and friendships (although this one tends to last a lot more than romantic relationships) don't go anywhere, let alone middle school and elementary school ones, and we all know that unless you've known somebody from your school for quite a long time, still live near you or go to your current school or your workplace, or if you've gotten along with your friends like brothers or sisters, then you wouldn't really keep in touch with your friends from school at all. Even if you still do, those numbers are usually about 2-3, or maybe even 4-6  at the most. When you go out and hang out with your friends riding your own car or one of your friends' cars, 6 does seem like a huge number, but it still is relatively small if you compare that with everybody in your school yearbook in your grade or your age. Maybe even compared to your friend group at the time, depending on how big it was. But still, the time you guys spend together and the memory you guys share are priceless and you can't buy that with anything as you can't go back in time, and I never had that many relationships to even begin with, especially with my crush from middle school. That took a humongous toll on me during my high school life and I never really acted normally or happily, letting my autistic self come out a little bit more than I should have controlled and that resulted in me getting rejected by many people and considered awkward by some who I thought were my friends from middle school. Because I didn't cope too well with that, I missed a lot of the opportunities I could have possibly had in high school. That same year I became a high school freshman, my beloved cat died too so that did not help me at all either. In fact, that added fuel to my depression and sadness. Especially because she died while I was away in Japan to see some family and I did not get to have a better and proper closure with her.

But fortunately for me, I was somehow able to turn my life around when I decided that I wanted to play trumpet and baseball during my remaining high school life and although it did not go the way I wished it would, I still regained many people's friendship and was somehow able to turn my life around at the last moment. However, I am still considered to be awkward even in my college life and people take note of that, and I don't know if I could do that miracle again just like in my last years of high school. I do all these extracurriculars many people did in their youth like some sports, an instrument, another language, martial arts, etcetera as a college student but the experiences aren't really the same and I still really can't relate to many people with my compromised social skills and my lack of common experience. So even if I did meet people from my past again in the future, I don't know if I could really reestablish a friendship because of those factors. Many tell me that I should completely move on and find someone new and all, but you meeting somebody from your school again in a whole new setting is not too uncommon and I say this from experience. Not to mention that those new people you meet in your new setting also experienced many things you and I didn't do during their childhood and their school time. If those new people and your old schoolmate were to meet, they would definitely have an easier time bonding with each other than me bonding with my old schoolmate again in the future at any time. As I said earlier, especially with romantic feelings, it's immensely harder to find someone new than to find a new friend. I personally find friendships a lot easier than romance, although that still does suck even though I am doing better than in my past. If you find something you weren’t able to do in the past and you want to find out what it is or are genuinely into that activity, then I say go for it. But whatever you do, do NOT think about doing it to catch up to people’s experiences because you’ll know they will always have different experiences and with that mentality, you will never be able to do that activity without feeling inferior to other people and your happiness in doing that will be there only for so long.

I am one of the rarer autistics who actually does go to college, is capable of getting a part-time and a full-time job, able to drive without any problems, and so on, but neurotypicals who can do this have lives outside of school and work and I just don't know how to make that happen. And just because I can do all those things, it doesn't mean they're easy to do so. I still suck at picking up social cues, saying something excessive, being impulsive with my words, and understanding the situation to list a few, but I don't know how to fix those. As stated earlier, I am actually one of the rarer extremely high-functioning types who's extremely close to normal to the point where I know that I'll always be missing something and never will be a completely normal person, as much as that sounds ironic right now. People always tell me that I should accept myself for who I am, but you really can't do that when a great majority of others don't. Especially in my family, my dad is just super hard on me at times and gets mad if I miss just one teeny expectation so how the fuck am I supposed to accept myself for who I am? My parents (my dad a lot more than my mom) also always tell me stuff like ""What are others gonna think if you do this or that?"" or ""People are gonna think you're somebody crazy like those homeless people on the streets"" whenever I do talk to myself (I do this a lot less now) or something ""autistic"",  and you're always excessively encouraged to hide those traits like that and you're even punished for failing to do so at times, so it pretty much is impossible to accept yourself because a great majority of others do not, not even your own family. As much as I do think it is important to fix the awkwardness that my autism causes, I still think being excessive about it and others bickering too much about that to our faces makes that stressful as fuck, even if that wasn't their intent. Even if you do accept it yourself, you can only go so far and play defense for so long until that finally loses its effect over time. Even if you do hear shit from other people like ""who cares about what other people think because you're you"" or tell yourself ""I am who I am and if you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself"", which are all true to an extent, you're still gonna be alone, rejected, and be yelled at by people at the end of the day. You still need some acceptance as we're humans and are social creatures, so you're gonna need that to be happy and it's important just like food, water, or a place to live are for human survival. 

Neurotypicals expect so much from us socially and if we miss even one of their standards, they treat us like we're deficient and it's the end of the world because we high-functioning folks are seen as ""not too severe"" or ""not that badly autistic"". But at the same time, they don't ever reach over for us when we need something and they constantly ostracize us from their own personal lives because we're ""too awkward and inept"". Do you see the double standards right there? Do any of these sound familiar to you at all? As much as I think merely working hard is not enough for your work and results are what matter the most to be accepted in society and I usually do take a very conservative approach on that, I also think you need some recognition for what we've been doing to try to fit into society because this whole masking shit is hard enough already. This is pretty much why I think my life would have been a lot better without autism ruining my social life. No, scratch that, it already has been different if I weren't autistic, and masking our autism in social situations and what happens when we do that are perfect proofs of that. Life is already unfair and hard enough for neurotypicals, but we also have this burden that limits us from the basic things neurotypicals can do in their daily lives, making ours twice or thrice as hard and we don't need that. A gift is supposed to make our lives easier, not harder like autism.

I've had relationships implode because of my awkwardness and my inability to read cues and I don't want that anymore in my life. If you neurotypicals point that out to me and/or just outright avoid me, why don't you guys actually tell me what the problem is with me and describe how you guys think it could be resolved? If you're gonna say shit like that to people like us, then we at least deserve to know what's wrong fully so we can at least try to work on it. But many don't and talk behind your back because they think it's rude to do so, they're scared to tell us honestly, or they think they don't have the obligations to tell us and think we're not entitled to an explanation, or whatever the reason may be. I know that people are just notoriously bad at telling you things, but if you have the guts to point that out in front of the entire crowd, you might as just well tell us what's wrong with us and how you guys think it can be addressed so we can at least try to work on it and I have made numerous improvements and growths in fields I suck with whether it be social skills and cues, academics, and so on, so there's no way we won't improve if we were told. I'll admit I may get defensive at first when told honestly to my face, but if you offer advice as well, I could at least appreciate the honesty, no matter how aggressive and hostile the person's demeanor is in doing so. It's the same with customer service and review: if you're gonna leave a 1-star review about a certain restaurant, at least write why in detail it was bad so that the owner could make it better for his or her next customer and you can't just expect him/her to read your mind cuz he/she ain't a freakin' psychic. This is one of the things I cannot understand about neurotypical people in general.

Just to let you guys know, many of those people I'm talking about are liberals and leftists and many of them talk about equality, acceptance, and other gay SJW bullcrap and I know this because I'm from Los Angeles, one of the most liberal places on Earth. I'll tell you that these people do not accept autistics and even if they say that they do to your face, they'll make it clear through action that they do not every chance they get. So you're telling me, you people rather accept people who are sexual deviants like the LGBTQ+ and their groomers, pedophiles, decadents, and leftist terrorists over someone who genuinely struggles with something they're born with and cannot help it? What an inclusive society we live in am I right? I'm not saying that conservatives and right-wingers are more accepting of us, but at least they don't pretend to care when they don't.  This is pretty much why I can't let people know the true me because, from past experiences, there are no benefits in coming out. I'll remind you, it's not so much about accepting yourself, it's about others accepting you as well.

Speaking of having no benefits coming out to people, another bullshit piece of advice I get from others around me is just to ""be myself"". I'm pretty sure everyone who has ever lived on this Earth - both neurotypicals and autistics included -  has received this advice too at one point in their lives. But the real question is, what the hell does being yourself even mean? Really. Does it mean just be yourself as long as it's not too deviant? To all these people who have told me this: what did you really mean by ""just be yourself""? Is that what you were trying to convey to me? But putting aside whatever they were trying to tell me at that time, the advice of ""just be yourself"" is just the most bullshit advice anyone in this world can receive. From personal experience, you do not want to know anybody 100% because you see their ugly side too and everyone knows that everyone has a dark side that they try their best to hide. We who are autistic do see that very ugly side of other people around us because of the way they act towards us whether we like it or not, unfortunately. Probably because we're ""socially unaware"" and people do try to take advantage of that and nobody would ever properly reprimand them because we're the ones who act ""weird"". But going back to this whole ""be yourself"" bs, you actually do NOT want to know other people 100% because as stated earlier they have a dark side or a secret or two that just turns you off. If the whole world knows who everyone is 100%, then the whole concept of public and private would not even exist in the first place. Even neurotypicals who are reading this and ones who are actually decent and level-headed would tell you that this ""be yourself"" advice is absolute bullshit. There is a certain norm in the world and if you do defy that even by the slightest, you would be given a blank stare or worse depending on the situation. Plus, we’re pretty much like the only one who suffers from autism or other neurodivergence, which means we’re the minority out of the minority, so that ain’t gonna work out too well. 

And about love, good luck ever finding that if you're autistic cuz it's hard for us as we're seen as lower than and if we do, it's because they either feel bad for us, they're simply taking advantage of us (especially if we do become rich miraculously, women who would give a fuck about us would be gold diggers only), or they're trying to show the world how much of a ""good"" person they are to feel better about themselves just like those cringy degenerate SJW morons. The last one technically does go under the second one of taking advantage but that was pretty vague by itself with only one example so yeah. People can even make inspiration porn with the last option. If you do find legitimate love, then good for you and all I'm saying is that it's harder for us autistics with love, which is something even neurotypicals find hard to maintain.

I also have this whole regional center support shit I'm still in and that's where I get all my accommodations for school from but I have never really relied on them for extra help. I have to have these annual meetings virtually on Zoom or whatever program they wanna use and that just reminds me I'll never be a normal person, and my whole life and this whole support shit make that all fucking crystal clear. I tried requesting these coordinators some social skills classes that could help my awkwardness, which is the only bet that could help me socially, but these guys treat it with no sense of urgency and many of my personal coordinators just quit their jobs immediately. In fact, these guys even forgot to give me info regarding my wish and my annual meeting. Not to mention that they're also condescending and I can tell by the way they talk and act toward me. I may be autistic but at least I can pick up on stuff like that. I tried telling my mom about my whole thoughts on this and she was like ""you do know it's their reference that's getting you all these accommodations you need at school right? If you don't like it, we can quit any time but you can't reapply anymore as an adult. Otherwise, stop complaining because you need them"". Well, not exactly those words tho. I made it look really bad but you get my point tho right?

I'm stuck with this curse forever and lemme reiterate this to you, it's a CURSE. Autism has set me back many times and in many fields and it affected my mental state for years and will continue to do so in the future. Let's say there is a person who can't walk from birth and has to use a wheelchair or a cane to move from left to right and you call that inability to walk a gift. That guy is gonna get fucking pissed at you and would beat your ass if he could. I would like to use the hiking analogy and people who can't walk can't go all the way to the mountains and enjoy the beautiful views nature has to offer them and they can't take their wheelchairs or their canes with them there. It's the same with autism, it's a disability that limits communication and development and it has closed numerous doors of opportunities normal people can have to us and you're not always going to have help wherever you go or are at every time. I always hang out with my neurotypical friends because being alone doesn't work and whenever I do see them, many of them are doing some cool shit with their lives like playing college varsity level sports, being in any college band, helping out with movie productions, and for something smaller and a lot more common, some are conducting research and even making new discoveries at times, making a girlfriend (or a boyfriend if you're a girl), traveling abroad, winning awards for something, getting internships for a really good company, and so on, but many people around me seem to know what they're doing with their lives and make something out of it.

Even if those types of people do genuinely accept you from their hearts and think you're a cool and good person who’s fun to be with, you still feel inadequate because in many cases, our parents have to make us give up on our interests and put us in some special program so we could at least be close and try to fit into being ""normal"", so it's extremely hard not to feel inferior and inadequate compared to your peers. This is what I mean by a lack of common experience and even though people tell us to not compare ourselves with others, which is also true most of the time, it's hard not to do so, especially when those high-achieving people excel people like us in many fields, even in ones we show tremendous interest in whatever that may be for individual autistics. There are more than good enough reasons why autism is considered to be a disability and why these support services even exist in the first place.

Don't even get me started on autistics being with other autistics because that doesn't work either. If you put someone disabled with another person who also has shit conversation skills, it just naturally implodes and there are not any relationships from the beginning in the first place as both parties have such horrible communication skills. Or maybe one side has such bad communication skills and there's a huge disparity between the disability to the point where the more high-functioning one just gives up completely. Cuz that's what happened to me. I struggle to relate to other people with autism, as there were no follow-ups in conversations with them and I couldn't even have a basic conversation with them. Even with the good ones it just doesn't feel satisfying, no offense to other autistics. I basically just have to carry the relationship with them and I'm always the one who had to initiate the conversation, and I'm not interested in a one-sided relationship and friendship.

Many of them also live obliviously and are like children or teens in men's bodies so I cannot have serious life talks with a lot of them cuz they don't know what you're going through. I still struggle with some of these too but at least I am able to look back at my past and reflect on myself without people telling me that I was in the wrong because even if I were told that, I did not care at all most of the time and I still don't, depending on the situation I would be in for me to be told that now that I'm not a rebellious and cheeky teen anymore. Because these people who tell me that are the very ones who show their ugly sides and take advantage of me and they've shown me who they really are as people, so they're in no moral position to tell me such.  But overall, at least in that regard, I think I am a lot better off than most autistic people I have met at school and have grown up with because most autistics do live obliviously and move on with their lives completely, whereas I always look back at my past and always mumble to myself ""You/I shouldn't have said or done that as a person."" because it's a fact that I have done and said many fucked up and horrible things in my past I shouldn't have.  

Just like neurotypicals, they have double standards too at times and when you do ask them for help, many won't cuz they're too shy or too inept. I have also met autistics who were just outright scumbags who annoyed me, acted up in class, didn't read through the line, and argued with people, and they meant all that. I also forgot to mention that many can't take a joke by taking shit literally and killing the good vibe. The last point I want to make is that the way some of them hit on someone they're into is just way overt too. An example of that was when I was in 8th grade, there was a girl two years younger than me who also has autism and had a crush on me. The things she did to try to hit on me were excessively touchy and other annoying methods like trying to talk to me constantly many times. She was that stereotypical teenage bad girl who was rowdy and rebellious to her parents, teachers, and the entire society, always mad and grumpy, spoiled at times, having issues with her friends and peers around her, and just something you would see in stereotypical teenage girl movies and you add autism to that. I wouldn't say she was mean because I don't believe she had any malice in doing all the stuff she did to me and still wish for the best for her to this day, but it still was annoying nonetheless and I do believe she had real frickin' mental issues too. 

Now if this is a guy reading this, many would think that I should have been happy that a girl liked me and was showing signs (really obvious ones in the case of this autistic girl) and shit, but if you don't find that person who has a crush on you attractive not even by the slightest bit and inch, then what they do to you is nothing but pure annoyance and many people who are reading this, whether you're autistic or not, would agree with this as some may have experienced something similar to this themselves too, unfortunately. But then again, it's not their fault they are like that and all, but that just made me not wanna be with the people in that community.

Surely I have made some friends in my past special education elective classes during school, but most of those friends were people with ADHD, not autism. Going off another topic, but just like how the severest form of autism is nothing compared to the severest form of ADHD, the mildest form of ADHD is nothing compared to autism. I'm not trying to invalidate ADHD people's experiences but from personal experience, people with ADHD tend to be hyper a lot of the time and have trouble focusing in classrooms, but they are a LOT better in social situations than us autistics. They get to take some medication that helps them control their hyperactivity, but for autism, there probably is nothing similar to that. People with the severest form of autism usually cannot feed themselves and cannot go to the bathroom on their own, and they just can't live by themselves and that is not something the severest ADHD people go through in their adult lives. I know people can have both of these disabilities, but as I said earlier, people with ADHD only generally do better in their social lives whereas we don't have any lives outside of school and work, no matter how mild our autism may be. So, it's hard to really relate to anyone when we're like this, even with other autistics. Because ADHD people can actually relate to others, whereas autistic people usually cannot from my experience.

It's not even a community at all. To me, it's just a group of people who happen to have the same disability cuz it's every man for himself in this community as they don't really help each other out too much IRL. I have made peace with a lot of those disabled people who I had problems with in my past and I did reestablish somewhat of a relationship, but it's never really gonna be the same because I just have this knowledge that he/she won't help me and/or is oblivious in this area so I can't really deepen ties with him/her. But I'm also not gonna let go of someone who is a good friend if I later find out that he/she was autistic. I'm not going to say something like ""You're a good friend but you're disabled/autistic, so bye"" to the person if I found out later on in my friendship with him/her. I would feel really bad and shit about myself for who I am if one were to do that to me too. But at the same time, I'm not really gonna look into the autistic community for a good friend cuz it hasn't happened to me historically and I do NOT wanna hear this whole ""YoU DidN't TrY HaRd EnOuGh"", ""YoU'rE ThE PrObLeM"", ""YoU WeRE TOo HaRd oN ThEm"" type of comment. Because I tried as hard as anyone should. In fact, I tried more than I should have. You're the one who doesn't understand.

Although all of these aspects I have ripped on autistic people for are issues I still struggle with even to this day, like getting pissed easily and killing the good vibe, and I have even been a bully myself at times and have treated people like crap by calling them slurs and letting my own problems out onto people, it doesn't mean I want to choose someone to be friends with or even have a romantic relationship within the autistic community. From personal experience, any people who have something that's bad in common, their relationship turns to shit, it is especially true with autism and social skills and cues, one person and this other person who share those exact same issues, it's just a recipe for disaster and my relationship with 98% of other autistics I have met over the course of my life have actually been a lot worse than with those condescending and rejecting neurotypicals. But at least I can actually have basic conversations or even share one or two things in common way more with the latter. As I said earlier, I'm not saying that all autistic or neurotypicals are callous and outright scumbags because I have met decent people from both parties, nor am I saying that I'm superior to other autistic people in general. Because as I said earlier, I still struggle with many things I listed on how autistic people do socially too. After all, I have this condition myself too and I have ripped on neurotypicals and their issues too.

However, while I do feel like I am different from many neurotypicals I've been around since my childhood, I also feel too different from other autistic people too. Just like how many neurotypicals are diverse, unique, and different from each other, autistic people are individuals too, and one autistic man/woman is different and unique from another autistic person. In the latter case, as mentioned earlier, there are very big differences in the severity of autism depending on the person, and the issues faced are unique to each autistic person, so it's kinda hard to deal with other disabled people too when you're disabled yourself and are dealing with your own issues in your life at the same time. It's also hard to deal with other disabled people when someone is a lot more severe and can't even have very basic social interactions and communications as people. This is another significant reason why I think that the autism/Asperger's community is not really a ""true community"" to me personally, at all. But rather, a poorly organized group of people who happen to have a similar type of developmental disability.

What do you guys think? I wanna know in the comments below. I hoped this has enlightened some of you and I hope this serves as some sort of improvement for those who lack something I mentioned in the post. Because these things I mentioned that autistic people lack are vital for building a relationship as we're social creatures and being alone does not take you anywhere. I've tried that for a long time and it only works for a while until it finally starts to screw you up mentally. I don't want anybody to go through what I did. I hope everybody including autistic people would have a better childhood than me.

Also, I do NOT want to hear these types of comments where they say that the harms of ableism and trauma are more of something my rant fits into than autism struggles itself cuz that doesn't really help me at all. It doesn't help anyone at all. Saying stuff like that doesn't serve anyone long-term and people who struggle with autism do not improve at all from saying that. I have clearly stated what autistic people have issues with and what I have issues with personally, and I want people to improve on that and I want to improve on myself so you and I can have a better quality of life. Again, I'm pretty sure a lot of people here in this subreddit are happy with themselves with autism, but I think very differently.

True, nobody should bully or mistreat others just cuz they're different, and people around you mistreating and not accepting you just because you're different is an issue with how they are rather than with you yourself. But even if you don't get treated like crap openly by others, you still lack some skills neurotypicals have for granted like social skills and so on depending on each individual autistic person. As much as neurotypicals should be less judgmental, more understanding, and accepting, and do better in treating us with dignity and respect, autistics should learn to do better overall, adjust themselves gracefully as possible, and properly be punished and reprimanded for their bad actions because using one's disability to accept or condone morally unacceptable actions by saying stuff like ""give him/her a chance, he/she is disabled!"" doesn't do anyone including the disabled person him/herself a favor. That just isolates neurotypicals and autistic people even more.

I don't know about you guys but I currently do not plan to have any biological kids because we have a risk of passing down autism cuz there's a really strong chance that it may be genetic and/or hereditary. That means that I might pass down this faulty genetic makeup of mine to my own kids and they would have to go through the exact same types of suffering I have gone through as a kid. In fact, their disabilities might actually be worse than mine and I don't want to risk that as autism is a spectrum disorder with different levels of severity. I don't wish this on anyone, not even on my worst enemy, so why would I want my kids to have it and suffer as I did? That'll be very selfish of me to do so and I can't just go on and tell my kids that they were born just because I felt horny and had sex with my future wife when they question me about why they have to go through autism and why they had to be born if they do end up being autistic like me. About having kids, as much as I only want biological ones, I couldn't because of this.

So stop saying that there's nothing wrong with people who are disabled, that doesn't serve anyone.",1
"Why are ADHD and autism often bundled together? Excluding cases when the conditions are co-occurring, it's hard for me to understand how there's any similarity between the two and why they both fall under the ""neurodivergence"" category. Even if people with ADHD and autism could exhibit similar difficulties at times, it seems that their etiology is still wildly different.

I guess I'm more interested in the practical aspect of it though, like are you able to relate to people with ADHD? Do you usually make good friends with people with the condition? Do you participate in group therapies with people with both conditions? Any insight would be appreciated.",1
"Aspergers and Porn Hi There

I genuinely don't know if there is a link between these two things but I was hoping from insight from my fellow Aspys, both male and female on the matter.

I have been watching porn for a long-time now (since I was around 14, it was how I was first exposed to sex) and while I don't believe it's ever influenced my behaviour towards others or led me to develop a negative outlook I do find myself wondering whether it's normal.

For example I genuinely enjoy spending a few hours browsing the internet looking for the specific videos and photos that I'm after on that day, and enjoy having that intimate time by myself but I'm worried that might be abnormal.

I genuinely enjoy porn more than sex most of the time as I find it much easier, but I'm also worried that may be a bad thing too?

Either way thank you for reading my post, and thank you in advance if you decide to comment your thoughts or offer any advice",1
"How many jobs have we had? I’m 29(m) and sitting at 44. Jobs ranging from Sales to food delivery to factory to retail and my own small businesses. 

I was strict when tallying up and only counted gigs I’ve had & collected at least 1 paycheque. 

I went to university but dropped out and don’t regret that honestly. Reason 1 is that I had a good time there and experienced things my strict upbringing didn’t allow me. I’m no longer in contact with my family. Reason 2 is that I’d never have progressed in the field of study I chose because I now know that I don’t and will never possess the skills to play the corporate game or workplace politics effectively enough to carve out a decent path. I’m intelligent but I’m not smart. 

Reasons I haven’t lasted in jobs range from being managed out, social exclusion, bullying, insubordination, conflict, relocation and some just normal reasons. 

I’ve read that over 80% of us are unemployed. Just wondering how my 44 stacks up in comparison to some of us on here.

EDIT:

A) Thanks for your responses. It’s not a huge sample size but it’s helped me understand this topic a lot better. 

B) I should probably add that some roles were concurrent and some temporary. I’ve been lucky enough to work at a few major global sporting events for example so they last only for a few weeks. And I mentioned that I moved to different cities and towns for periods of time as well so they were only ever going to be stints. Even taking those out, it’d probably put me at around 30 in & around my home city which is still relatively high.

EDIT 2:

I’m black btw. I’m not sure how that would’ve affected the responses and I didn’t do this for dramatic effect. It initially just didn’t occur to me to mention. I’m fairly big and had an experience in my late teens of being a paid athlete… which is only  one of the 44 jobs I included. Even with my size and typical intimidating build I’ve endured bullying and the rest and on a couple of occasions I’ve had to use violence in self defence. I won’t reply any more but hopefully this provides food for thought for anybody that encounters this thread despite where we do or do not fall on the spectrum.",1
"Woman abuses her dog in front of me, and tries to hunt me down three days after I called her out on it Hello,

A few days ago while I was on my lunch break, I took a walk and noticed an older woman (looked around mid 60s) with her friend taking a walk with her dog. She was coming from an intersection and I was behind them for around 2.5 minutes. During that time, I noticed that every single time her dog was trying to take a poop, she would just very harshly tug on its collar for (dog was trailing right behind her, and would keep tugging everytime she felt the dog stop). I noticed that as time went on, the increments between each time the dog needed to poop got shorter, indicating that he really, really needed to go. As they were about to go off to the other trail, I caught up to them and said, “hey mam, you need to pay more attention to your dog because I’ve noticed that you’ve been tugging on his collar every time he needed to take a sh\*t, I think you should stop for him.” And I walked on, but as I walked away, all she said was, “well, hey NOW if you had just let me EXPLAIN…” but I wasn’t going to stand there and talk with a clearly crazy person and I think I embarassed her in front of her friend, to me, that was enough for her to finally actually let her dog take a poop so that was good enough for me.

Flash forward to literally just 2 hrs ago, I was walking and she came up to me and said verbatim, “are you that person who came up to me a few days ago?”

me: yeah, think so

her: I just want to ask you what made you think you could say that to me, and about that fact that YOU didn’t even let me explain

me: you really let that event live in your head rent free for three days?

her: excuse me?

me: you should get over it.

her: What is your name?

me, walking away: you really wanna know my name, Karen? Keep wondering.

Karen: ..Karen?

Upon hearing me say Karen, I saw a switch go off in this witch’s head and she whipped her phone out and started recorded me

Karen: I’m going to take a picture of your face and post it on every corner of the internet to let people know that YOURE a danger to people

I didn’t try to hide my face because I knew I didn’t do anything wrong, and when she took my picture she started to walk away, looking very pleased with herself. I then whipped out my own phone and started saying, “well, if you’re going to take a picture of me it’s only fair I get yours too, right?” Cue her panicking. As soon as I start recording, her demeanor changes and she starts trying act like a victim, saying I’m crazy over and over and “what’s wrong with you!” All while trying to hide her face. While I was recording her, she actually tried to hit me and knock the phone out my hand, and I caught it all.

Would I be ok if this were to be held up in court? all I did was tell this person not to abuse their dog (didn’t literally say that verbatim to her, but I’m pretty sure preventing a dog from pooing counts as abuse) and I’m guessing she got so embarassed because I humiliated her in front of her friend, that she tried to find me for three days to get her “revenge.” I never touched her, only when she tried to hit me I tried to put her hand away to stop her from smacking my head.

please feel free to ask questions or if you need clarification on some parts, this just happened to me too so I’m just also trying to process this. Thank you.",1
"Aspergers is an affliction that robs it's sufferers of a proper human experience. The human experience is a multifaceted journey that spans an entire life cycle. The human experience is one of modulation; generally, using different abilities to experience life, and to judge oneself in relation to it's environment. This modulation encompasses articulative social interaction; as, human observers articulate themselves in relation to others to gain new experiences. Aspergers as an affliction categorically inhibits the ability to socialize, as sufferers are unable to properly use the innate gift of social interaction.  Aspergers sufferers lack the innate human trait of proper socialization from their neurological abnormalities. The consequence of this, is that aspergers sufferers are forced to live an unbalanced human experience, in which they compensate their social ineptitudes with ""special interests"". For these very reasons, from birth those with aspergers are fleeced of a proper human experience, in which they are prevented from properly wielding their tongues with others. Whether or not one with aspergers is content with their condition, a proper human experience will always be somewhat unattainable. What a subtly degrading condition to be born with.

Edit: What I meant behind proper human experience. All human experiences are different, but most of them involve similar elements from a biological basis. There are simply a range of components that combine to create a human experience. Eating, sleeping, sex, thinking, and socialization are all examples of core experiences, and to be deprived of these experiences is deprivation of core components to perceiving and wielding life. A ""human experience"" can be aggregated by looking at a normal range of experiences, and those with aspergers don't fit the normal range that I listed. A very important part of the human experience for many people are their connections, which aspergers can inhibit the process to connect.

Edit 2: What I said about special interests was a bit inaccurate, what I really meant was that deficit in social abilities generally causes some kind of compensation, as it can cause you to find other ways to spend your time if one would normally spend their time socializing.",1
"My son is diagnosed… I need advises from other aspies. Hi All, My son is 15 years old and diagnosed for High Functioning ASD last year. This was after he attempt suicide. He was diagnosed for ADHD when he was 7 and he was under Methlyfenidate medication when it was hapenned. It was a shock for all family.

I’m trying to search about autism to be able to support him today and make possible for him a good life when we passed away. We love our son and his differences are just make him special.

My main concerns are listed below. But of course I’m missing something. Please add your comments. Appreciated for your time… 
Wish all of you the best.

- We couldn’t tell him his diagnosis. We were expecting to work on it with his therapists. So he will understand that there was always a reason for his confusion. He doesn’t want therapy and refuses to talk with them. Still trying to convince him for weekly therapies. How should we talk to him about his diagnosis and convince him for therapy…?

- He was placed into the special education program in the same public school after he released from hospital and following institution. Should we continue with public school or search for alternative school options? Academically he is good and takes AP Math class.

- We want him to have some interests. Sports / arts etc. To support his social skills. He prefers to spend long time on his computer games. We can’t convince him to go out.

Not: Apologies for the long message and language mistakes.",1

"College professor nearly kicked me from college for ""cheating"". Turns out I didn't actually ""cheat"", but everyone still thinks I'm stupid/lazy as hell A year ago, I enrolled in art history as a minor. Till then, I was never any form of ""science"" person; I always specialised in literature and essays. Due to this, my first ""science paper""...tbf...felt really strange to me. Scary even. We also didn't get a special ""introduction"" class, like in my major. Instead, we just got a rough paper and a generic  ""...and remember to cite your sources!""

My first topic was pretty heavy: The Christian St. Nicholas. If you know the guy, you'd know that he not only has little paintings of him (ORIGINAL middle age depictions -not 'Santa Clause' legends), but even less information on any of them. If you're lucky, you'll find a random ass Italian text and websites that don't cite their pictures. Which, in this case, happened to me: Exactly one (1!) text which talked about the painting...and which was in fluid Italian.

To cut things short: I screwed up. The entire thing. There's not one thing I did right, basically. From the thesis, to the structure, to the cover letter...everything. And tbf; I am not that surprised. I can analyse the shit out of certain things, but writing a formal, completely objective, observational, paper...? I would have probably needed excercises beforehand per se. Just to give me a ""feeling"" for the style & differences. Aka: It's unfortunate, but next time, I will actively seek out someone I can check up with. Easy, peasy...*right?*

...well...not really.

You see: While fucking up, I kinda hit the queen kicker.  Because a science text felt so ""other"" to me, I thought that it also needed special treatement. After translating the Italian text with Deepl (tip: don't. It might still translate things wrong.), I was confused in how I should quote it/use foreign sources. As I had no trusty ""MLA handbook"", I went around to ask people and went to -oh irony - courses against accidental plagarism. I think, in hindsight people thought that it was just a sentence or something I needed to translate. ""Just write vgl."" (vgl.=compared to), or ""Just say 'summarised from'."" The answers were very simple, which ironically made sense to me: Science is about facts. If a painting is in a wooden frame that's a fact, not an interpretation. And you don't need to quote facts, do you? *(In hindsight, yes, I know how stupid that sounds, but I was trapped in bureaucracy and semantics)*

Anyway. Half a year passed. I get a mail from my prof, telling me I failed his course. Including the fairly angry rant that I not only cited wrong, but he could kick me from college for ""translation plagarism"" -only reason he didn't do so, were 1.) I was ""only"" a 2nd semester and 2.) he was one of the people I bothered with my problem. So most likely wasn't supposed to be sneaky cheaty, just incompetent. After that I realized I needed some help. Like, personal help. Aka someone I could work WITH, not just unpersonal theoretical stuff I misinterpret. However, as expected, I mostly gained mockery. Because it was so ""obvious"" to everyone else. People instead constantly think that I was just ""too lazy"" to find the right source. 

Honestly. I'm not even surprised at that reaction anymore: Something blowing up through a miscommunication. People screaming at me and seeing me as a bad person. Then when I'm not, it's still my fault and I'm just ""too stupid/lazy/why didn't you...?"" Guess it's the ASD experience.",1
"Running out of road.... fed up ASD, fed up life   

*Warning, misery dump incoming.* 

I am completely fed up of life and really feeling like I'm running out of road right now tbh...

I’m mid-30s…. no relationship or even dating, that is precluded by being cursed with this horrible Aspergers condition (yes, it is a curse – the ‘autism is my superpower’ lobby can go screw themselves). If I was super-good looking I could perhaps make up for it but I am a 6 at best, so basically all round poor-quality genetic material. To make matters worse my sexuality is messed up (mostly straight but around 30% gay), though in my case it is almost certainly down to having a super distant relationship with my father (thanks autism gene!) as I don’t find most guys attractive (I find guys much easier to read than gals, so most of my experience is with guys). So if I ever did get in relationship that would prove a major stumbling block. Social life – same thing, a string of failures, missed opportunities, awkward encounters. 

My ‘career’ is a dumpster fire – just a string of short-term, low-status jobs etc. I have a decent job atm though the pay is not great. I have been building a freelance business on the side though I don’t earn anywhere near enough to do f/t, so the extra money is basically just covering the rising cost of living, so I am in effect running just to stand still. My job is right in the firing line for the AI revolution and I have little to no other marketable skills, and believe you me I have pushed my limited intelligence to its limits. The thought of being unemployed again just terrifies me – honestly I would rather die than deal with that humiliation again.

Despite saving saving saving I still cannot afford a house or even a flat, so I am stuck in the living hell of renting i.e. handing over a huge amount of my wealth each month to some scumbag landlord for some crappy tiny flat. I’ve rented about 6 places in the past 10 years and EVERY one of them had at least one serious issue with it (mice, damp, noise etc.) Currently I am in the middle of a formal dispute with my previous landlord due to a tissue of lies and unsafe practices at my last place, though it looks like they’ll get away with compensating me maybe £100-200 – chump change for them so basically they’ve gotten away with it. The property system is completely rigged and the thought of living like this for the rest of my life just terrifies me. And if I do buy somewhere than what? – it’ll be some cheapo rubbishy flat at best in a dodgy area – me being a slave paying it off for 40 years. I won’t even be able to have dog in such a garden-less tiny space, which is the one thing I would like (kids are out of the picture obviously).

I attempted to ramp up the saving by swallowing my pride and moving back in with parents rent-free (at their suggestion I might add). I lasted 2 months. They are utterly toxic. Their marriage is near collapse. My father is a selfish, childish, OCD narc, almost certainly Aspergers too – he deliberately picked a woman (my mom) with very low self esteem to marry as he knew no one else would put up with his crap. I won’t go on, but dealing with his endless anger outbursts/sulking ruined my childhood (enabled by mom who constantly made excuses for him), then he just ignored me in adolescence – no advice or guidance AT ALL. Nothing. Living there dredged all the old resentments back up and completely wore me out and so I had to get out as I was approaching mental breakdown territory.

Society/politics – my country (UK) is in serious decline. Each year things get worse. All the institutions are failing. Politics is an utter waste of time – all parties are just utterly corrupt and self-serving. The country won’t collapse Somalia-style, but it is rapidly turning into a Latin American banana republic – stagnant economy, hollowed-out middle class, dysfunctional institutions, corrupt politics. There is no future here and I don’t have the skills to emigrate somewhere better. My fraying faith in the society itself (as opposed to the political class) was finally destroyed in the Covid period. I could see it was all a load of nonsense pretty much from the beginning, and seeing the vast majority of people just obeying nonsensical and inhuman orders because ‘The Science’ says so, whist viciously scapegoating and hating anyone who raised so much as scintilla of scepticism, has just shredded what little faith I had left in humanity tbh. 

As for the bigger picture… I have searched for ‘God’ for 19 years now. Studied all the major religions and most of the smaller ones too. Psychedelics, meditation, prayer, sacred texts, counselling etc – I’ve tried it all and nothing has worked or filled that God-shaped hole in my heart. Reluctantly I have concluded that’s there’s nothing to it and ended up a de facto atheist which frankly depresses me no end. All my old hobbies (films, reading, travelling, going out drinking) just completely bore me now and I get nothing from them anymore. I am constantly angry, constantly tired, I have no hope for the future, either for myself or the wider planet. I am sick of being shafted by scumbags for money which is all anyone care about on this fetid cesspit of a planet. I don’t even have the salve of friendships and family as this horrible brain deformity makes it impossible to establish relationships. I am just completely DONE and I’m not even sure I’ll make it 2024. I am running out of road pretty fast.",1

1)  I'm 18 so it would require me to talk to my parents first because I personally don't have money for the diagnosis. I've been trying to bring this up with my mum but I always get too anxious to even start. It's so stressful even thinking about telling her that I suspect having autism.  
2) The idea of talking to a stranger about my life is another extremely stressful thing which prevents me from getting diagnosed.  
3) I have looked up places where I could get diagnosed that are not 200km away and the diagnosis there is literally just 1 meeting, either a 3 hour interview or 2 hour ados2 test. This makes me feel like it's not going to be reliable and that even if I were to get diagnosed it would still make me think that it might be false.  
4) I'm not sure if it would benefit me tbh, I kinda feel that this ""self-diagnosis"" made me understand myself better and I don't harm anyone with it cause I don't even bring it up. But on the other hand I would like to get diagnosed to explain my behaviour to my family without sounding like an idiot, or if it turns out that I don't have autism I would atleast know what's up for real.

So what should I do? Is it worth going through all this stress?",1
"Mask falling off? I have two selves. Myself and my masked self. I have a pretty easy time masking *when meeting new people* and acting all fun and sociable. A lot of people like my masked self, and I often quickly make friends when presenting like this. 

However after I've established a connection with the person, my mask subconsciously falls away and I retreat into my *actual self* - robotic voice, low energy, shy and awkward. Not the fun, nice, sociable self I initially presented myself to them as. Problem no. 2 is that I can't seem to go *back* to the masked self after dropping it, as it's incredibly exhausting ... and they've already seen my real, unlikeable, self now so what's the purpose?

This issue has directly resulted in people becoming disinterested in me pretty fast after I ""retreat"" into my awkward little self. It makes me incredibly sad that I can't seem to hold on to people.

Why is this? Is there a way to ""retain"" the mask?

I should probably note that I was diagnosed 1.5 yr ago and haven't really talked with my psych a lot so I don't know a whole lot about autism or its effects.",1

"Do people with aspergers panic less in stressful situations? Somehow I never get into panic crisis mode. At the moment something happens I'm just very aware of everything around me.

Like I was biking and a car hit me from the right (they had to stop). I got hit and I did not brace myself (some weird thought that bracing will cause more harm), hit the windshield and slowly fell of the hood to the ground. I just laid still on the road and slowly tested al my muscles and limbs for injuries before standing up. I was okay, the bike not :(

Other stressful events have happend and I always stay aware of the situation. I never panic in such situations.

What I was wondering if this is a thing that's aspergers related, a generally normal reaction or just my thing. I often see people getting emotional out of control at such critical moments. I just stop (even if it's for a split second) and analyse first before doing anything.

Edit: Thanks for the answers. And I do hope you can find a way to transform or get rid of the sources that gives some of you anxiety.",1
"I feel like NTs underestimate how shitty you get treated in life for things you can't help. Especially since most of them for some reason believe we live in a just world and anything bad is probably your fault. Us higher functioning aspies get treated like shit cause we look like NTs on the outside but don't act like it so they just write us off as stupid, weird, lazy, dangerous, whatever. And don't even get me started on stuff like height, being born into a poor family, having a physical deformity, having any sexual problems (this one especially if you're a man), being physically disabled, being homeless (I know some people can be homeless due to addiction issues but there's a also a lot of people who are homeless who were are veterans), etc. The world is colder than what people wanna admit and I'm just sick of people trying to convince us it's this way because we some how deserve it.",1
"Shower Thought: Trying to Get a Girlfriend is Exactly Like Trying to Find a Job I feel like I should issue this disclaimer up front: I am not owed a date/a girlfriend/sex, woman are not involved in some nebulous conspiracy to fuck Chad's, or any other incel bullshit. I can't say I'm happy about woman turning me down repeatably and I will admit there are times when they could be nicer about it but they made their choice and I have to respect that.

All I'm doing is expressing/venting about what the dating life is like for me on the spectrum.

With that out of the way: getting a girlfriend on the spectrum (and it wouldn't surprise me if it's like this for most NTS) is exactly like looking for a job; you can send ""resume"" after ""resume"" but 99% of the time you get passed over without a second thought. Woman tend to be pickier about their partners then men (and with good reason) so they usually have a lot more choice. Same thing with work; as they usually have more applicants than jobs.

Connections are everything which works against me in both instances.

The few that are willing to give me a chance usually either drop me for shallow reasons, treat me like shit, or are running some kind of a scam. I'll admit there were more than a few times where I kinda deserved it though although there are plenty of times when I didn't do anything wrong.",1
"New to this Hi,

Recently, my psychiatrist said I might be on the spectrum. He said I should go for a diagnosis, which takes years in the U.K. It's bit been a bit of a hard base diagnosis, I've always felt different socially and generally how I process my emotions. I work in software, so they haven't been so supportive, they say everyone is a bit, but in a way, I feel they don't understand.

"My Best Friend of 15+ Years Has ASD - Need Advice I’m making this post because frankly it hasn’t always been easy to get along with my best friend. I love him like a brother and we have the most transparent relationship I’ve ever experienced which I’m grateful for. 

There are some, mostly very small, challenges that come up with him regularly but those “small challenges” can pile up sometimes, especially when we’re together, and leave me in a place of shock and a desire to understand. I’ve done very minimal research on ASD admittedly because I know how hard it was for him as a teenager to become diagnosed. He was (and still is) incredibly resentful of his parents and he believed the diagnosis was for them more than himself. He is so resentful that he has nearly completely ridden his immediate family off out of his life. I did not want him to feel judged by me so I kept myself in the dark of what ASD really was even though I was more aware of the signs moving forward. 

As a teenager, when we met, he was a goofy kid in school. He wasn’t really invested into school even though he is very intelligent. And he ended up dropping out of high school after trying 3 different schools. He did end up getting his GED later and went on to try different majors in college at 3 different universities before ultimately dropping out. When he did get into college he invested everything he had into his studies and had incredible grades. I could tell this was very validating to him but it came at such a high cost for him. He didn’t take care of himself at this time. He barely ate, showered, or had any social life. He would take so many classes at once to try and speed up the process and often verbalized he was capable of succeeding this way more than giving himself less of a load. He had all the time he needed grant you, his education was completely covered by him using his once hated diagnosis of ASD as a means to obtain diversity scholarships. I watched him 3 times in university completely burn himself out by putting too much on his plate. He always had an excuse ready though. With engineering it was “I have a math deficiency.” With environmental science, which he was one semester from completing, it was “I don’t see where this career path leads to success.” Etc. 

After he dropped out he tried odd jobs like delivery driving and basically just became a recluse. I ended up getting him a job with a friend of mine at a vape distribution company. He dove right in and within a year moved all the way up the ladder where he was the right hand guy to the CEO. All the while he would call me nearly every day to tell me quite literally EVERY detail of his work day. That went on for years and still continues on his current career of truck driving. 

His life as a trucker I think suits him very well. He’s really good at it and makes good money. Unfortunately I think it also does cater to him holding on to some of his worse traits of not taking care of himself which I’m worried will catch up to him eventually. Example being he almost exclusively eats fast food because he’s so fixated on managing his job responsibilities that he doesn’t plan for very much else. 

Every once and awhile if he’s close by where I live we try and coordinate for him to stay with me. I know this is mostly a time for him to relax and try to unwind from the work life, so I try and make things comfortable for him. He can’t let the work go though and basically only talks about that unless I really take charge and have us do stuff. He has also never been very organized with things/belongings, and it a total slob when he comes over and leaves his room and wherever he hangs out, which is normally the kitchen table on his laptop, a wreck. And he likes to poke fun at how neat I keep my place, calling me “domesticated” or make fun of something I have, saying it’s over the top, like a frosted mug for a beer he wanted. 

I know this is a really long and personal post, and obviously I can’t fit it all on here, but any advice or resources someone can provide on how to better understand adults with ASD would be much appreciated. I hope this hasn’t read like a rant, I’m just trying to paint a little picture to show what kind of person we both are. I do care a lot for my friend, and I hope some day we can break through this “unspeakable” diagnosis he has and be able to talk clearly about his ASD so I can better understand how to be there for him and tell him my needs too. Thanks!",1
"Spring is coming: Looking for tips for light sensitivity in the morning The month is March and in the Northern Hemisphere that means sunlight is creeping into our rooms earlier and earlier.

I am not sensitive to light to the point that I have to wear sunglasses outside, but enough that it wakes me up in the morning, sometimes way earlier than when my alarm rings.

I lived in Sweden for some time (where it's sufficiently high up north that in summer there's practically no night time, a nightmare) so I've already tackled this issue in the past with moderate success:

- Blackout curtains are great, I love them, I would never dream of sleeping without them. The problem is that in my current bedroom the windows are slightly arched, so the curtains don't cover them entirely and there's still enough light coming in to illuminate the whole room.
- Cardboard on windows was very efficient, but from the outside it makes you look like a lunatic, if you have a lot of neighbors facing your window. I also struggle with routines so I'd 100% leave them up at all times, and I don't want my neighbors to start asking questions.
- I've tried sleeping with a sleeping mask, but somehow by morning I'm not wearing it anymore. I think I take it off in my sleep? While traveling I've also used my tube scarf (the interior is a kind of plush material and the smell is comforting) but in summer when it gets hot that's not really an option.

"Successful social strategies? I've been trying now for years and I can't seem to figure out a good way to interact with NT's that is respectful in my eyes. I'm seen as combative, argumentative, and negative more often than not when trying to engage in their ideas and conversations - to the point that I actually can't figure out how to ask a question correctly with out negative social repercussions. The only successful strategy I've found is to treat them like emotionally unstable children - where you coddle and manipulate them with soothing voices, positivity, and a focus on their immediate ego driven whims. 

The smile and nodding thing while casually echoing the last half of their phrases seems to work really well - but I cant find a way to engage in their ideas with out grievously offending them in some way. Just coddling them works well enough but at that rate why bother having the interaction in the first place if its all just a song and dance so they don't throw a temper tantrum? Like I get that my brain might not work quite right for what ever reason, but it just feels like I'm surrounded by spoiled children all the time :(

Then when I just let them do their thing because obviously, they don't want me there, some of them will give me an attitude for not contributing.

"Is this autistic burnout? I picked up my gf after work to go get groceries as we agreed upon. When she gets in the car she asks ""can we also stop off at my parents to give a bday gift to my dad?""

For some reason that really stressed me out. A last minute social engagement, my nightmare. I started driving to her parents place. Along the way ""oh but we have to get a gift."" Ok, another change, I would have taken a different route had I known she didn't have a gift yet.

Then ""actually let's do the grocery shop first then the gift."" Help me, I feel like I'm dying inside. ""Ok"" I say.

We get groceries, she gets a gift, we go to her parents. The whole time my insides feel like they are recoiling, trying to escape this mortal realm to dive into the abyss. We spend like 2 hours chatting to her brother, mom, dad, other brother. It's pleasant enough, they are nice people, but I'm already feeling so stressed and exhausted I'm having a hard time keeping my mask on and smiling, but I do.

We head out and go home where I go lie down on the bed in the dark for another 2 hours. It's been hours since then but I still feel so exhausted. I feel irritated, noises are making my head hurt but I don't have a headache, my body has no energy, moving feels like I'm walking through molasses.

"Elon Musk is making us all look bad, and I'm worried that NT people will think we're all like him This is going to be a bit of a rant, but I would like some other people's opinion on this.

Elon Musk has been seriously pissing me off ever since he bought Twitter. Just recently he was harassing a now former Twitter employee for being disabled. Musk has since apologized but I feel like he only did so because somebody from his pr told him to. I get that it's very common for us Aspies to do things that are rude but normally when we do so it's for something small, not something like this.

Elon has also been pushing far right conspiracy theories like the myth about the world population going down rather than up, which is why he has so many kids. I've heard some people saying that he doesn't really spend that much time with his kids, but I can't really confirm that except for the case of his trans daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson. He's even COVID a ""specific form of the common cold.""

He doesn't spend anymore time with Jenna and he blames communism for it. He says that he supports trans people but calls pronouns an esthetic nightmare. If he actually did support trans people than he would spend more time with Jenna.

Musk has also reinstated the accounts of multiple right-wing extremists like Marjorie Green, Andrew Tate and the Babylon Bee. He also replies to accounts like Libs of TikTok, an account that's well known for getting people doxxed, and he promises that Twitter will be a better place (for them).

I've also read that he's one of the worst people to work for (most rich people like him usually are). During a production problem a Tesla he told his employees that they weren't smart enough to be working on the problem. I've also heard that employees will avoid walking past his office or where ever he's, especially when he's having a bad day, in order to avoid being yelled at or possibly fired on a whim.

"Frustrated after doctor’s visit Hello everyone. I am writing here hoping to get some feedback about next steps for my son (10 yrs old). Today we finally had my son’s Autism evaluation that we have been waiting for six months to get. The appointment left me frustrated and at a loss of what to do next. The doctor that we met with is a very prominent one, (he is nationally recognized), so I was excited to be able to see him to get some help. However, the appointment went in a completely different direction. The doctor constantly talked over me and seemed dismissive of any concerns that I had. He asked me if I watched Young Sheldon, and I said yes. He said “that’s your son,” but basically it didn’t matter that he had autism. His anxiety was the only issue that needed to be addressed, and to get therapy for three months, and if that didn’t work, to put him on Prozac. I know that medication works wonders for some people, but I am not putting my 10 year old child on Prozac. I came to get help to learn how to best interact with my son and support him in his autism. I wanted tips on how to help his food aversion, his struggles with texture, him trying to argue his points without seeing other people’s views, etc., but the answer for him was just therapy and try Prozac. He even said that he thought that he had ADHD (even though he focuses just fine in school and at home), but that having autism was not a reason for any of his struggles. So I guess my question is, do I get a second opinion from someone else about a treatment path for my child?",1

I literally don’t know how to get by in life, throughout most of it I’d just get approached by someone and then he’d be my support and we get through things together then never talk again.

"Feeling misdiagnosed Ever since I got diagnosed a few months back I have been so confused about myself I feel like none of the criteria fit me really and I don’t relate to autistic experiences
But after my tests my doctor and psychologist insist that I am on the spectrum
Why?
The reason they gave me was that I repeat a lot of stuff have weird speech patterns lack eyecontact and ask odd questions.
Well that’s what they gave me from my behavior at least
I had tests done where they tested a lot of my skills they were ruling out intellectual disability and came to the conclusion I have autism because of my spiky profile and social behavior.

I don’t have sensory issues or specific interests really. I have social problems but that was due to me growing up isolated with my autistic mother

Still it bothers me because I have work where I have to be very social and since autism causes social issues I am now really scared of how other percieve me. I never thought of myself as different.

I still don’t understand my social struggles, as a child I played with other kids fine and apparently autistic kids struggle with imaginative play which I did not. I also have no need for routines… also I had speech therapy as a child and they didn’t suspect anything being off

"""Normal"" I know this topic was brought here millions of times, but I do it again.

People say to me ""why don't you just act normal?"", specially girls, and I only have one way to act. One way I found that it's mostly acceptable in some circles. I'm the ""crazy"" one, if I don't use my ""quirky"" traits to make some kind of show to them, I end up being the laughing stock. People still make fun of the ""crazy"" one, but is less painful than being the laughing stock, and it's more fun and more authentic. It makes me feel like I have a little control over that, feels safer. And that's all I can do on ""acting"", rather than isolate myself.

I don't know what ""normal"" even is, I think people say that I have to be normal just to make fun of me or manipulate me... Or maybe try it to see how I react and measure my worth based on it, and I don't want to be a surprise test subject, I don't want to be more anxious than I already am about social interactions and pleasing everybody acting a different personality to each individual. I can't maintain an image of being another way than the one I practiced, so, being what they call ""normal"" isn't inside my possibilities. I used to answer ""NO, I CAN'T AND I DON'T WANT TO ACT NORMAL, leave that to the ""normies"" and their social problems"". 

I think being normal is being authentic, but in society seems like ""normal"" is some kind of general thing that everyone knows what it is, and assume everyone should act that way, and a the same time, they reject it, they say ""being normal is boring"", ""normal people are boring""... But when they see a REAL person that is not normal, they jump to ""CaN't YoU JuSt Be NoRmAL?!"". They say they don't like ""normal"" just to gain some kind of social tittle they don't naturally have ... Like if being autistic was some kind of privilege.

2. She said something like ""oh you don't want to hang out with me? you just want to be alone on your phone?"" which sounded to me like she was being passive-aggressive (but maybe i misinterpreted)
3. I immediately put my phone down and said ""i'm not allowed to be on my phone? you're making me feel guilty for being on my phone""
4. She took my response to be passive-aggressive (again, i was overstimulated and didn't quite have much awareness of tone and affect but i was pretty sure her tone was aggressive and mine was apologetic, passive but direct). Then she got angry and started yelling at me
5. I felt threatened and became more regressed and eventually went into shutdown when she was yelling at me.

1. how to predict when this is going to happen, 
2. how to manage situations like this in the moment
3. how do you defend yourself when you feel like someone is telling you your tone was combative but you're pretty sure it wasn't (situations like this are where i think autistics like me are very susceptible to being gaslit)",1
"Should I seek a second opinion? [F][20] Hi! Recently I got tested for Autism but instead I was diagnosed with the following:
•Bipolar type II
•ADHD
•Generalized anxiety (Social anxiety) 
•Sensory processing disorder 

Should I get a second opinion? They used ADOS to test me. My test results said I did make some eye content, did hand gestures , was friendly so basically I’m too emotive to have autism . But they don’t realize I was masking the entire time and have learned to mask. Seeking advice🥺. I’m feeling lost.",1
"I'm not lonely but I really am I often feel like I can thrive when I'm alone and don't even consider the idea of other people. Emphasis on the last part - it's getting more and more complicated to do that. Like, actually impossible without alcohol or drugs. So, once I stick my head out of my metaphorical cave, it's like I'm assaulted, sucked into social ""games"" I'm not even really interested in playing and where I'm the obvious loser anyway. Like the idea of other people being here, judging me and expecting things of me based on my look / age / expected role makes me automatically a participant in a play I never wanted to be in. 

DAE, what do you think, is this an autism thing, an anxiety thing or a didn't-have-meaningful-relationships-for-a-long-time thing, a need relationships too much thing, a repressed emotions thing, what is this, input would be appreciated even if it's just an opinion.",1
Do people ever stopped talking/liking you because you are autistic? I realized I'm losing some friends. I haven't said anything neither did anything wrong. It seems that it's because I am autistic. I don't understand why they would stop talking to me and treating me well just because I was born like this. This upsets me a lot. Have you ever been through this?,1
"Why cant I seem to do anything when things are good? Yet I'm super productive when things are bad? I am stuck in this mess currently, and I don't know what to do. When things are bad, I am stimulated, with a clear mind and am able to function well. When things are good, my mind goes blank and I don't have the motivation or clarity in my mind to do anything, I always end up in a pit of executive dysfunction. I've tried meditating and Adderall, yet none seem to work. I am completely lost and don't know what to do.







 I can never have a clear mind, I've tried adderall, meditation and nothing works that well, Except when things go wrong. Like I can have pure concentration and feel normal when something goes wrong, like when I got fired from my job and was miserable. I was motivated and was able to live a somewhat normal life. Now currently when I wake up, my brain doesn't work. I am not motivated and completely blank of thoughts. I don't know what I am doing and I am always stuck in confusion and executive dysfunction. I feel that i am punished for being happy. I dont know how to move forward. No matter when I get motivation, I always revert back in a few days. I feel that I am punished for being happy. What can be done to help?  


 I have always grown up in rough situation's and I always had the motivation",1
"Oh God, where to begin with this So guys,

reading the comments made by those diagnosed with autism/asperger spectrum disorder, particularly  a comment where a user described it as ""being like in a movie or a play where you're coerced to do the role to the best of Your abilities while not knowing the script"" hit me hard or that people with asperger's have unusually strong interest in a certain field. For example, mine was aviation, and by the age of 12, I was easily able to tell certain aircraft apart by just looking at details which majority of the general public would find miniscule (such as shape of the aicraft nose, the length, the engines etc.) Also, not to mention the other stuff such as being relatively introverted and the fact I had a dificult time socializing as a kid. At 23, I have reasonable doubts that I might be on a slight autistic spectrum. So, for those who have been diagnosed with it, how long does it take for an adult to be diagnosed by a psychiatrists?

Also, a question for girls; is it true that women are normally able to hide their autistic traits considerably better than guys by simply learning how to imitate other ""normal"" girls?

&#x200B;

God bless You,

&#x200B;

have a wonderful day.",1
"[Rant] Kinda bummed that I'll probably never be able to have a job I've been on temporary disability pension because of Asperger's since I was 20. Never worked in my life, I was stressing out about my first year of school that I couldn't finish. I didn't know how I was going to get income when I drop out since in my country you are entitled to financial aid while you're a student if you have a condition that makes your functioning limited.

My mom suggested disability pension since she knows a lot about these things because of her work. I had no idea such thing even existed but when I read about it I thought ""Hey, this sounds like something I could qualify for!"". So I got fixated on the idea that I -will- get a pension and I'll -never- have to worry about money again.

Fast forward an unknown time and here I am twiddling my thumbs at age 23, a year left of my pension. I will probably quality for it once again, but man do I have dreams. 

I wish to be a pharmacist or an entrepeneur. My doctor asked me where I see myself in the future, and I told her that I wanted to start studying pharmacology and start working at a pharmacy. She shut me down and asked if I have ""realistic dreams"". She might be right, I have too much issues with stress and sensory overload. I don't think I'd actually be able to study full time.

Or did she gaslight me? I don't know, but man I wish I had a skill or a profession. Everytime I try to learn something new I get overstimulated with information and eventually shut down.

I want to be so many things. A screenwriter, an author, a 3D artist... but my human condition is being limited by Asperer's. I kind of hate it.

I guess I just gotta sit down and enjoy my pension and special interests, while I can.",1
"Believing in yourself when there's nothing to believe in and everyone around you seems to lie to make you feel better? The title basically. I'm so tired of trying to find the answer to this. It's been killing me for months. I just don't understand it. How does one believe in themselves when they can't do anything right? When they only make everyone around them upset and say the wrong things and make the wrong decisions and fail and fall and fail and FAIL? How?! I don't get it. I mean, what is there about me that could be construed as positive or good and worth being happy about it being apart of me? That I'm a kind person? Hell no, that's only lead to me being taken advantage of and having my feelings disregarded. That I have good work ethic? What does that matter when I can't even get a job I can handle? It's just so painful knowing I'm this... Pathetically worthless while the few people I consider my friends have been able to move on with their lives, slowly growing more and more distant as they leave me in the dust. It feels like if I don't put everyone before myself then they'll leave me, and you know what, they probably will. And I probably deserved it for not being good enough, for being unable to adapt and push through the challenges of entering the real world. Honestly, the only thing I deserve is to be put down like a dog so I stop dragging everyone around me down with my attitude, my inability, my lack of value, all of it.

I know I should be able to get past these thoughts and the myriad other negative thoughts, but I can't and don't know what to do anymore. I'm so close to giving up, to just accepting that I'll always be alone, anyways be disgusting and fat, always be in pain, always a disappointment. If I were just a little bit braver maybe I'd even man up and remove myself from the equation of life and lessen the burden I inflict on everyone around me. But I'm not, I'm just a pathetic, scared, crying little boy in a man's body. The only way I can see it is I deserve this pain.",1
"I hate it when someone tells me to date someone else with aspergers or to try an autism dating site. Just because someone has autism doesn't mean that I would have anything in common with them, that doesn't address that everyone with autism is different and aspergers is different than other types, less than 1% of woman have aspergers so that would really limit me, and many of the people on those sites are in a different country that I'm not interested in going to just to meet someone.",1
"Afraid of diagnosis. All my life i have felt so alienated from my peers. I never truly fit in if i was being my genuine self. Only when I started observing my peers mannerisms and trying my best to mimic them, was I truly accepted. I always knew autism was a thing, but the thought of me having it never crossed my mind (mostly due to the inaccurate representations of autism in tv shows and etc). It was only recently that I started to research some of the symptoms commonly associated with autism and almost every symptom was relatable in one way or another. For the first time in my life I finally felt as if i had a complete understanding of myself. I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety, but I always felt as if something was missing and those diagnoses were just a few pieces of the puzzle i have yet to solve. I am convinced i am autistic and i hope i am, as it would answer so many questions i have about myself. I feel as if i would be diagnosed with autism if given an evaluation, yet I’m afraid to do so because if i was not diagnosed with autism, then I really don’t know what or who i am, what community can best support me, how to give an explanation to past experiences, etc. 

I feel like I’m experiencing imposter syndrome.

Anyone have any feedback or is in a similar situation?",1

Just the way he completely throws social expectations to the wind and is not afraid to be a creep, pushing first amendment protections to the brim.  Yes, he crossed a line.  

I also am gonna be honest and say that the way he spouts the nonsense loudly and pompously is hilarious, combined with how ridiculous the statements are.",1
"I made a horrible dating rookie mistake and now I question my own morality Let it be clear from the start: I have a weak theory of mind and I always considered myself a good person (I donated blood 15 times and plasma 13 times, and I worked as a volunteer four times in my life), but I'm still deeply ashamed for what I did.

I had my sixth date with a woman who reciprocated my feelings since last November (we were knowing each other so that we wouldn't have made rushful decisions, not to mention she also had high expectations on me) and she was aware of that fact I was autistic. Under the assumption that it could have been an indirect compliment, I told her that her sister (whom she showed to me a few days earlier) was an attractive girl, but not as much as her. She also asked me if I wanted to meet her, and I naively said yes (as a friend). These two reactions made her feel cheated and she told me I don't deserve her  and that I dared to tell her that her sister was better than her. I tried to explain that I didn't mean to offend her but, alas, she didn't just listen. I also told her that I felt manipulated, because I don't like trick questions that may be interpreted the wrong way (I tend to give straight answers because of my condition). Now we broke up and I started questioning my own morality, considering I promised myself to never treat the others as my bullies did in the past. To add insult to injury, I found out only a few minutes later on Reddit and Quora that what I did was a big no no. Well, better late then never. Now I can at least avoid repeating the same mistake in the future with an unpleasant memory I will never forget.",1
"Asking about Asperger’s My father is diagnosed with Asperger’s, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder mid of last year.

All of my life I had struggled with social interaction, inability to understand people’s way of thinking/thought processing or emotions. I was always behind in school, no matter how hard I tried.

My mother recently told me how in Pre-School and through the years when I was young that I was obsessed with stairs. Pre-School was 2 hours, and the entire time everyday of Pre-School I would climb up and down the stairs. My mom then went on to talk about how they did everything to get me to do other activities, and to engage more with the others kids. But that never stopped me from climbing the stairs because I was distracted and obsessed with them. 

Then my mother talked to me about how she bought the tall 4 shelved bookshelf’s that were those big plastic ones typically used in garages. She had bought four of them, putting them in the dining area where I would put all of my collections obsessively on. But those cool were constantly changing.

When I hit elementary school, I had a very hard time making friends because I wouldn’t understand why they had such disinterest in me. I was loud, talked very loudly, but I never saw anything wrong and why they thought it was wrong because that was just how I talked. When adults and teachers would yell at me to be quieter, I was always hurt personally by those comment because it was just me.

Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was constantly told to smile and look happy. Which I also didn’t understand because I thought my facial expressions were fine. Then I come to find out that everyone was saying I have a resting bitch face. Which I also found out intimidated people, which was obviously never on my agenda. I still get these comments quite often. 

Starting towards the end of elementary school and all the way through my freshman year of college, I pick up interests in sports, academic clubs or councils, and other activities but then I would shortly loose interest in them. It’s an endless cycle.

I’ve learned a lot about how undiagnosed and unrecognized Autism throughout your youth can start that development of Bipolar Disorder. 

My mom the other day in the car had told me that she believes I have Autism, and that she missed all the signs when I was growing up because we moved a lot, and that she wished she would’ve recognized them sooner to get me tested. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about it, and with my knowledge of my father having Asperger’s, and my mom coming to me about her thinking I have Autism. And I’ve been thinking about bringing this all up to my provider because its expensive to test for a diagnosis, and I don’t have the money to be able to do that. 

I have no idea how to approach this further, or to even wrap my head around everything. I was wondering if there’s any more advice on how to go further with this.",1
"How many friends did you guys have in elementary school? I’m honestly curious, since I remember always having one “best” friend or someone I was more attached to than anyone else. I also remember getting annoyed when other people would try to join us and wasn’t welcoming of meeting new comers in general. 

I do recall trying to join groups during their pretend play only to be kicked out usually. My mom told me that I left the “popular” group in kindergarten because they wouldn’t let me be who I wanted to be during pretend play. It wasn’t that I couldn’t pretend play, but was rather uncooperative. My first grade teacher told my mom, I would be one of those people with a few close friends but not a lot of friends. I wonder what aspect of me made her say that.

"I have a lot of problems that are constantly bothering me I’ve been having a really tough time lately. There are a lot of things bothering me that instantly make me depressed once I think about them.  


* I’ve been out of college for over a year and I still don’t have a full-time job. I’ve tried so hard to find one for my degrees (communication and film), yet I was only able to land a part-time job as a baker in a cookie store. The only full-time opportunities I got were for sales jobs. All the jobs related to my degrees also require years of experience I don’t have.
* At the same time, I’m scared of what having a full-time job will do to me. I don’t like the idea of having to wake up early each day (for the record, I usually wake up around 9 or ten) and then work for eight hours only to go home and have little time to do the stuff I want to do. I also hate the idea of having little free time to do things like going to game stores for Warhammer and d&d.
* There’s so much stuff I want to do, yet I don’t have the will to do them. There are games I want to play, books I want to read, stuff I want to watch, models I want to write, and stuff I want to write. Yet I rarely get around to any of them and more often than not just waste my time browsing YouTube or Reddit. I can’t seem to make myself do any of those things despite wanting to do them. And then my list of things I want to do grows larger without me making any progress on getting through it.
   * On top of that, I feel like I’m extremely lazy. I feel like I put off stuff I need to do constantly, either because I get distracted with other stuff or because I don’t have the will to make myself do them. For example, I wanted to make this post for a while and only now have I finally found the will to do it.
      * I am diagnosed with ADHD and I heard a lot of people with it suffer from executive dysfunction, but I don’t know if I have that or if I am just lazy.
* I want to write, but I also don’t want to write at the same time. I preferably want to write fiction and while there are plenty of ideas I want to write about, there are some that I feel uncomfortable writing about for some reason. I don’t know if it’s because they’re too personal, if I’m afraid of being judged for them, or if I’m scared people would look at me differently because of them. But whatever the reason is, I don’t want to write about them despite writing being what I want to do.
* I feel like I pursued the wrong career in college. I originally wanted to pursue either engineering or filmmaking, but after having a terrible time in an engineering class, I decided I’d rather go into filmmaking and become a writer. However, with how hard it’s been finding a job and the problem I just mentioned, I feel like I made the wrong choice.
* I have few friends and don’t know how to make more. I moved down to Florida from New England last year and it still feels like I haven't made a lot of progress. I’ve tried going to game stores and joining a board game club in the community I’m in, but it doesn’t feel like I’ve made any big friendships. I try to keep in contact with my friends from back home, but they never text me and if I try texting them they won’t always respond to me. As you can probably imagine, it doesn’t feel good.

These thoughts have been bothering me for over a month now and they feel like a reminder of how awful of a person I am. It’s gotten to the point where I want to beat myself whenever I think about them because I feel like I deserve it. I want to find some way to resolve these problems, but I don’t know what to do.",1
"I stood up for myself for the first time today and failed For a long time, I’ve been made fun of by people because of what I wear. Usually it doesn’t bother me for long but it would be wrong to say that it doesn’t make me feel bad about myself or that it doesn’t make me insecure. People insult and make fun of me to my face, they touch me and make passive aggressive comments. Every time that I thought to start dressing more “normally” I always told myself, don’t be afraid to be who you are because who cares about what other people think.

Well today, I caved in and for the first time in 2 years I came to school looking “normal”. I got sick of all the touching and rude comments but I felt embarrassed to admit that. Everything went fine until after school, I was walking and I felt a girl pushing me from behind. She gave me a rude look and told me to get out of the way, and I ignored her.

She continued to shove me so I stood up for myself and said (in a strict tone back to her) if she can stop shoving me. It was the first time I had EVER done something like that as usually I just ignore people who are rude and I felt surprised in myself for a moment. Then her friend butted in and told me who do I think I am to be talking to her friend like that. Before I know it, all 6 of them (her and her friends) all started shoving me from behind on purpose with their hands while calling me a pig, an ugly b*****, and racist things. They were harassing me, laughing and mocking my words while following me around and I ignored them and stayed silent because I didn’t want to make a scene.

Eventually they ran off but I was so shaken that I started crying. I feel so ashamed of myself to let myself get pushed around by these girls who are 1-2 years younger than me. It feels so ironic that on the one day I looked “normal”, I ended up getting harassed and touched anyway. The shoving hurt the most because the whole reason I hate being touched is because I was physically abused when I was younger. It doesn’t help that I was also bullied (and my bullies hit me as well).

I couldn’t stop crying and my parents got angry at me. I don’t know if reporting it will even do anything because 1. there were multiple girls and I didn’t get to see all their faces, 2. they were all similar looking and wearing the same outfits, and 3. I don’t know their names. After they ran off I had an opportunity to take a photo of them but I realised I had left my phone at home.

I don’t know if this is the appropriate place to post this. But I feel very sad right now. Today I learned that no matter what I do, I will always end up getting made fun of anyway.",1
"Thoughts about getting a diagnosis I recently got diagnosed with ASD, by a psychiatrist. It should also be said that i struggle a lot with imposter syndrome, as I can't 100% see myself in the most common ""symptoms"" of ASD so to say. I do believe that I do have ASD though, but I find it hard to be completely certain. 

I thought getting diagnosed involved a longer process with many session over a couple of months. I had two sessions only. It didn't really seem that official, and ended a bit more abrupt than what I had imagined. I haven't really had time to think ahead or thought about which further steps to go, after getting diagnosed.

So now I'm kinda like, yeah ok. I guess I have ASD... What do I do now? Do I phone a friend? Do I join a community?
What does one typically do after getting diagnosed?

I feel kinda lost tbh.",1
"Undesirable career options Hello everybody! I've been diagnosed around two weeks ago. Since then I have dedicated time to research what could be a better fit for me in terms of careers and just life in general.

The career options make me depressed. Cashier, janitor, accountant etc. 

Any suggestions? Opinions? What do you guys do and do you enjoy it?",1
"Trying to figure out if I have sensory issues with clothes. What it it like to be bothered by them? My first reaction would be to say that no I don't have issues with clothes. My big sensory issues are noise, light and taste. And yet I look at my behavior and I have literally worn the same shirt (aka same company and style) for over a decade, same with pants. I don't really know what's it's like to wear a shirt with tags since the one I always wear doesn't come with them, but I'm pretty sure when I was little I didn't like them and my mom always cut them off for me. Sorry if this is tmi but I don't like wearing most underwear, I only have one thing that I wear and it's very lose which is why I like it. 

So I still don't really know if I have an issue with clothes, but if not it is odd I've worn the exact same clothes for over a decade. I do know I've had alot of coats that once they age a bit the interior texture is just awful and I can't wear them. 

Id really appreciate if people could share their experiences with this one, especially if your more mildly bothered by textures and clothes. It took me awhile to realize I actually dident like certain noises or people touching. My behavior always subconsciously avoided those things so I never noticed, it's currently happening with smell. Same might be true for clothes.",1
"Trouble concentrating I’ve never had difficulty concentrating before. The past couple of months have been increasingly hard.

I feel like I’m battling depression as well, but I’ve gone through that before and never had this focus issue.

Never diagnosed with ADHD, but I understand there’s it’s not an uncommon diagnosis for us. 

For work, I enjoy spreadsheets (I can get in the zone) but that’s not been my main activity of late.  I’m in my late 30s.

Any recommendations?",1
"I feel like upon not masking I lost a lot of skills. Is it a bad thing or an ok thing? I used to be so on top of things. I would speak up a lot and participate, I always did things right away. I was very stressed out living like that. I can’t describe it very well but I basically was functioning a lot “better” if you want to call it that. But eventually I started having insomnia a few nights a week and was pretty high anxiety about everything. 

As years passed and I got older, and eventually was diagnosed, I began to stop masking. I began to stop feeling like I always had to talk, I began not living my life on this very strict schedule of things that I simply must do. I like schedules but it was like I didn’t allow myself to relax and I still don’t know if I allow myself to relax enough. 

Last week for the first time in years I didn’t take a shower until the afternoon. I can’t stand how I feel when I don’t shower, but it’s like I forgot what it was like to just relax and do exactly what I felt like doing in the moment. Even on a day off I feel like I’m supposed to live my life a certain way. That certain way has everything to do with what would make me feel like I am a functioning adult who is doing what they are supposed to do. 

I may like structure but it’s as if my life has unnecessary structure and scaffolding around it. I am never natural. I used to be a long time ago. My days were whatever they ended up being and I very much lived in the moment. But it’s like I can’t be that way anymore. 

In living more honestly and not masking as much I kind of feel like I am failing at life now. I’m less on the ball as I used to be but to be honest I’m not sure I could ever go back to masking so much. I feel like I learned important life skills but I’ve just lost them. 

I don’t know how to describe what my problem is or figure out what it is I’m trying to ask here. I guess that I used to live so differently for so long and I really thought that I found myself but realized I hadn’t. I think I am still trying to find who I truly am at almost 40. 

When I live my life more relaxed and less hectic it kind of makes me depressed and worried. I get done all the things I am supposed to get done but it’s almost like those things have become even more difficult to do at all. 

It’s like, if I want to live a more relaxed life it’s going to seep into a lot of other things. It’s like I can’t just be relaxed in some instances and more on the ball in other instances. 

If something needed to be done I would just go out and do it, but now it’s like my whole life feels upside down if I need to do something out of the ordinary. But was that just masking? Because if I think further back in my life I’m not so sure that I was ever so on top of everything. I had to learn how to do those things. 

I feel like I regressed in a way. In a way it’s fine but in another way it made my life more difficult. Is this really burnout or masking? These are things that I’m still trying to work out in my head. So I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Sometimes when I write something and I put it out there I feel like I can analyze it in a different way so thank you for giving me the space to be able to do that even if my post doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.",1
"Too Unwell to Enjoy Special Interests Hello all,

I wonder if you have any advice - I’m not looking to complain, just to lay out my situation and see if anything can be done.

As you all know, not being able to follow and enjoy your special interests can be hard. I’m in a situation in which I have a neurological illness that keeps me very limited in what I can do - most importantly (and most impairing to an extent) is my cognitive faculties.

I can’t ‘ponder’ over things or barely read a page of a book as I get too unwell very very quickly.

Too much input (and really it is very little) can make me much worse, whether visual, auditory or just thinking.

How can I enjoy special interests or even hobbies? 

One of my favourites is searching for mathematical patterns in prime numbers or creating financial algorithms and exploring certain aspects of maths.

Others are linked to military history and so on - I won’t bore you with too much details - the point is I can’t really use my cognitive functions any more so feel quite stuck & frustrated.

Advice welcome.",1
"What I’ve realized about flirting that happens a lot more than I used to think it does Ok so apparently lot of people will flirt just because it’s fun and they’re bored, not because they’re actually into you.

"Difficulty living alone   

Sorry for my English, not a native speaker.

Does anyone have the same problem as I do? I have no idea what’s wrong with me. I live alone and if I spend a couple of days without speaking to anyone face to face, (I usually go outside and go to cafes), I start to feel terrible. My body starts to ache, I can’t sleep well. When I’m lying in bed and about to fall asleep, suddenly I feel like something touches my heart and after that, I’m not sleepy at all. 

Previously I was at uni and craved living alone. I got my own apartment and soon dropped out of uni for the second time. I just needed time to relax away from people. After a while, it got better and something changed in my brain wirings. I didn't want to socialize at all in my teenage years and suddenly I started to crave it. I wanted to go back to uni so badly, I thought I'll better handle social part of being a student, but thanks to executive dysfunction I was too late to apply. I think that's when I noticed this problem. I started to visit my mom once in 3 days, didn't think much about it, but later she moved far away. And I started to struggle. I tried to visit my relatives, but it’s not ok to visit them that often. I got an office job(I hated working at office), made a few friends, and still had the same problem if I couldn’t speak with them and when I stayed at home on the weekends. Then we went remote and I struggled again. I tried different supplements, thinking it is some sort of vitamin deficiency, and tried to just speak to people on the phone. Nothing helped.

I don’t even want to socialize that much with my relatives. It's hard to go outside and follow plans due to executive dysfunction. It all starts so suddenly. I don't feel an urge, Just some time passes and boom, depressive mood, everything hurts, can't sleep. 

From what I’ve researched people usually don’t live well in social isolation. But I don’t think it’s normal in my case, it’s happening too fast and the effect is too strong. I’ve never heard of other people that had a similar experience. I want to move to another city.

Are those panic attacks? Is my brain broken? Could it be my amygdala? I suspect my amygdala is too big and overactive. I probably should visit a doctor, but I’m afraid they’ll say “just talk to people more”. Last fall I went to a psychiatrist for my seasonal depression and mentioned my anxiety briefly at the end of the session. She said I don’t want to go out because of my depression. I took some antidepressants. They didn’t have much effect on me.

Can you give me some advice? I really need some advice.",1
"Why “be yourself” only really works for NTs I think NTs brains naturally stay on topic. So if they just mention what’s on their minds, people will still be able to interact with them. They’re just naturally in the moment and more or less on topic. My brain doesn’t work like that. People might be talking about work or whatever, while I’m mostly thinking of something completely off-topic like Finnish grammar. 

When that happens I’ll just have nothing to say. There shouldn’t be anything wrong with Finnish grammar, but that’s just completely off-topic. People get caught completely off-guard when I’m too off-topic. If I have a lot of energy, I’ll end up on topic and be able to participate. If I ask for any advice on how to deal with interactions and mention the work I have to put into them, people just accuse me of “not being myself”.

Sure I could exclusively hang out with people interested in Finnish grammar, but I don’t think that will work. My mind is just naturally off-topic. If it’s not Finnish grammar, it could be a million other things. Finnish grammar is only one example. It could be interchanged with pretty much anything. It could even be something more normal like sports. If people are talking about their day to day life, no one wants to hear about some obscure sports trivia. Even people into sports. If I have a bit more energy or motivation, I can kind of make small talk a game for me. But I guess that’s “masking” and masking isn’t okay. I just need ways to not be bored out of mind and I guess thinking of special interests or random topics accomplishes that. 

Maybe people will argue with me and say be yourself doesn’t mean ____. That just proves it’s only good advice for NTs. They can figure out what it actually means, while I can’t. I don’t think be yourself should be given as advice for me at all. It’s not even relevant if I’m being myself or not. I just find that the less autistic I act, the more fun I have in interactions. I guess people care more about empty sayings than me enjoying myself.",1
"Did your Asperger's influence your choice of study? I've seen many say that computer science/IT stuff is the preferred study of autistics, because we tend to be analytical.

In my case it's a bit different - I've always had an inability to understand the concept of injustice as well as rationalise it. I get very irrationally angry when faced with it and *have* to react or else I feel stifled. I'm thinking that may be why I was attracted toward Law.

"Accommodations At Work? After a hell of a weekend and an emergency therapy session this morning, my therapist is recommending I talk to work about accommodations. I have autism and ADHD. Though I was diagnosed about ten years ago (in my adult life), I have never asked a job for accommodations. This is my first job that I really love and I have only been here for a few months. However, she pointed out that it would be better for me to ask for accommodations for me to still love it and still do well in it long term, which I would like. I have a tendency towards burnout. In the last 4 or so years, I have probably had like 5 months of short term disability due to major burn out issue, which I am trying really hard to avoid.

Here are my two problems: 1) I never told my work about my diagnosis because I didn't want to not get my job because of it. Though I have talked about seeing a therapist in general, so maybe that will be fine?

2) I am not really sure what to ask for. My therapist and I will work together in the next week or so to plan some of this. She recommends a day or two a month of unpaid leave if I need it, and the ability to work from home if I need it. What else do people ask for? What should I be asking for?

How does this process work for most people? I am trying to prepare myself.",1

"I hate my peers (20M) Is it normal form us with Aspergers to like talking to people who are older than us rather our peers? 

I find older adults (such as my father or grandfather) much more mature and seem to have better conversations with them than stupid Gen-Z kids.

My mom says I need to have more friends but I respond with, “none of my peers have any hobbies mom besides stupid stuff like clubbing or TikTok. I know I may hyperfocus on random stuff like baseball, music history, U.S. President history, and silly anatomy stuff like congenital heart defects (I’m majoring in Nursing lol), but at least it’s SOMETHING. These kids are brain dead about everything. 

My peers (college kids) have no passion about their major, have a horrible taste in music (and I have listened to over 700+ albums from country to heavy metal music),  are addicted to social media, and are weirded out when I say anything about my “special interests”.

"Masking and dating I've been having an issue where I'll start dating someone, but they'll only have seen me in 'social mode'.
It's then hard to show them the more divergent parts of my personality. 
It's frustrating to know someone likes a version of you that you can only be some of the time.
Once I realise this I often start acting differently too, avoiding contact or being more closed off when we hang out. As I want to act well but I'm too exhausted to then.
It's really hard to explain myself too; as it often hurts their feelings acting like this, so it's an emotional conversation to navigate when I'm tired so I get snappy. 
I feel like it's almost impossible for me to be in a relationship without someone who is more accommodating than is reasonable. It almost makes me feel manipulative.
Then all of this ties to identity issues as to what part of my personality is really me, and if I want to give in and live like a hermit or keep trying to fit in.

"I had a date Autistic ADHD with CPTSD F30 here and my love life has been a joke. 
Tbh I wasn't interested in building relationships anymore. 

But me and my friend, who I didn't know that well, started to talk one day. We went on a date and spent the whole day together. We just talked and talked. 

I hope I'm not wrong but it felt different. I didn't feel anxious, I wasn't looking for warning signs as I usually do. I felt peace. 

I have used sex to create intimacy before.  Recently decided not to do that anymore. But with him I didn't feel like I even had to keep it in mind. He didn't touch me, we didn't kiss. I have realized that I need time to adjust and taking things slowly is perfect for me.

"Has anybody ever tried to tell you that you don’t have Asperger’s because your making eye contact? I had these online zoom calls with a therapist who specialized in diagnosing Asperger's.

"Learn from people who grow up in hardcore environments I moved to a 3rd world country and trough my sport I meet people from the lower working class who live very tough lives. Since the day they were born they had no chance really and they have resigned with the fact it's never going to be better. Some of their coping mechanisms are inspiring to me: 

Most have developed a strong ability to **ignore certain parts of their life**. They can't survive while dwelling on all the details of their situation. 

Most have **no expectations** of anything, but are **opportunistic**. When a chance presents itself they will grab it and work hard to get something out of it, but they expect nothing.

When they complain, it is about something specific that influences their life that very moment. And it never includes 'because I am poor'. Even though poverty creates problems for them, they don't dwell on their origin. 

When things are good for a little while, they **really enjoy the moment** and defend it with their life. Like: this could be the one good thing in my week, I won't let anyone mess this up and I don't think about tomorrow.

They are **proud** of the fact their difficult lives made them hard people who can take life in the face every day. 'People with comfortable lives maybe more happy, but they are also a bunch of pussies.'

No room for a victim mentality. They **suffer trough every day**, but they count those days as **personal victories**.

Their answer to 'how are you' is 'still going' or 'creating desire (to keep going)'.",1

Saying I'm autistic always makes me feel weird because I feel like I have to go in depth. When I call myself an Aspie I do it with a little flourish like ""Yeah I'm an Aspie 😩🥴🥰✨"" because I think it's easier to be lighthearted about it rather than people give me those stupid sympathy eyes.

"I don't understand why I am treated differently at work Just started a job as a pharmacy tech and it's largely been going very well, but I'm sensing a barrier between me and my coworkers. Like my manager who was actually hired after me talks alot with the other tech and it just seems like they converse so naturally. And there's just this awkwardness between me and the others, it's like they don't know what to say to me often. They used to begin conversations with me when I started but now they just like... don't. Almost all of use are brand new and recently met eachother and yet I'm feeling excluded. 

And for the life of me I don't understand what I am doing that is causing this. As far as I can tell I am acting just like the other tech, I feel like I'm socializing normally and doing everything right. So what the heck am I doing wrong? And to be clear everyone I work with are all nice and respectful, we get along well. I just feel like I'm being treated differently and I don't get why. Does anyone have any advice here? This is my first job so I'm new to this sort of environment, I feel like I'm doing very well in the job itself but I'm struggling socializing. Anyone have similar experiences?

Edit: Someone asked for more context. The reason I don't understand is half the people I'm working with are also brand new and started after me.

My school is making my life a living hell quite honestly, since I'm not interested in the slightest. I'm studying to be a classical guitar teacher and I just couldn't give less of a f. I got there cus I'm a good player since I started when I was 7 and my dad was my teacher.. Then I guess I kinda went for it as my profession cus it's fun to play and my dad would b happy and being a musician sounds cool...

I desperately want out now. I have students tomorrow at 5PM and already when I woke up today I couldn't relax cus I just remember tomorrow I have to go teach which sucks.

"Education and curriculae Anyone else having trouble keeping motivation to continue following boring curriculae at your studies? 

The lack of freedom in how far one can go out of scope bothers me; it always did. In a way the whole schooling system killed my creativity and curiosity at a very young age. Elementary was way too easy and boring. At high school some subjects were okay I guess like the exact subjects I liked very much. But I disliked the way it was thaught and I missed the why of things. I asked why do we learn this particular topic? To which I got this reply: You need to get good grades in order to get a degree so you can do something you like and earn a lot... 

That was what I was being told by my Math teacher. The same one that killed my interest in Maths. We had to solve problems I always came up with a ""different"" for him incorrect way of solving problems. Therefor always got bad grades. Then one time for a few months we had another teacher and my grades were very good. 

Lately I've studied some more Math and technical subjects on my own. And I like it much more now then when I was younger. 

It's just that I started a new study again and I'm running in the same viscious downward energy draining boring ""you have to do xyz-death circle"" That killing me softly thing again. 

Although self-study for me is better; majority of employers are looking for these overly valued degrees in my opinion. 

When you say that you do a self-study in insert any topic:...... it's not good enough. Even if you can prove your skills in a certain area of competence chances are like you/me being rejected for some other candidate with a degree. 

I'm pun intended on college graduates. You worked hard too but I think there should be more recognition for people who don't have a degree and work equally as hard or even harder; who get rejected by simply: hmm, no degree bla bla.

"Can someone share advice/experience regarding being on the spectrum with severe interpersonal difficulties and the desire or lack of to have interpersonal relationships and possibly answer social security questions. Sorry it is long, but I am desperate. I'm trying to figure out if I need to help my son. He was diagnosed Asperger's Syndrome and Generalized anxiety disorder many years ago. He told me he was asexual in his teens, although he did have a crush on a girl when he was in grade school. He doesn't have friends. He is 26 and lives with me. He has an online gaming life and does Door Dash, as that didn't require he apply/interview. He did have a job at a pizza place where his boss loved him and even bought a car for him so he could get to work, after my son's car died, so that he wouldn't lose him as an employee. He is very intelligent. He passed high school (with a C average) by acing tests and doing no assignments. He did well on the ACT, went to college for a full year and failed out. He is very uncomfortable asking for help. He has serious blood pressure issues due to an accident when he was a child that requires daily medication. He excels at table games and gets quite competitive, and in role playing games takes on characters and comes alive. Most of the time he is without affect. He is an adult and I try to give him autonomy and not treat him like a child. He pays for his car and insurance, although once in awhile late. I asked him to pay a small amount of rent ($100). He paid for one month and stopped. 

So recently I asked him about his medication and found out he hadn't taken it in months, he was out. I forced him to take his BP and it was close to stroke level. It isn't regular high BP, he suffers severely high BP which can lead to his organs shutting down. He aged off my insurance this year, so no insurance. I found a clinic that wasn't too expensive and took him there and got him meds. They want him to see a specialist. His BP went down to borderline high after a week on meds, so he is safe in that respect now. I asked him if he wanted to die. His answer was, ""meh"". Like I don't care. That is his general answer to anything feels involved, or requiring interaction. Just to be clear, if he is game playing, or talking about things he knows/facts, he is eloquent and quite verbal. It is only life/interpersonal/emotional where he shuts down. He did tell me he avoids coming downstairs because he doesn't want to have conversations with us about life issues. Health, job, possible school or training, chores, how he's doing...

My questions... For people who may have similar struggles. Does he really not care about finding someone who will be a partner? Does he not desire friends? Can he be content in his life without these things? Is there something that would help me get him to open up? I finally got him to sign up at vocational rehabilitation to see what job training he could qualify for. He has no clue what he wants to do though, or he can't/won't verbalize it to me. I make suggestions he just stares at me or says, ""meh"". Yes, he will look me in the eyes. This is due to my turning his head when he was young and making him look at me, before I even had a clue about ASD. He stares and you can just see the discomfort and anxiety. :( You can tell he is uncomfortable. So, he told voc rehab he wants a job where he can support himself. I assume this is so he can get out of my home and not have to talk about anything. We got his diagnosis records and I had him forward them a couple weeks ago. I asked yesterday if he had heard from them, he said no. I had to request that he contact them again, which he may or may not do. I can't imagine him out there, solitary, with no one in his life except random gamers online. Do those of you who live this way find it satisfying, or do you feel lonely? I can't assume to know what he is thinking/feeling or that it is anything like what I think/feel and am trying to figure out how best to help him. Can someone offer insight into the thought processes he might be having if you feel you have similar etymology of your ASD? I would normally try counseling, but he won't talk, so how would it help?

Could he get social security/disability to help even though he is technically working? It would help a lot if he could get medicaid. As far as adding him to my insurance as a disabled adult child, I was freaked out by the medical form asking for percentages of function from a doctor. He showers, gets dressed, goes to work. He functions. I feel like they wouldn't understand the level he doesn't function at because at glance he is doing basic tasks. They don't know that when forced to apply for jobs as a teen he was so anxious he drove the truck somewhere, parked and cried for a couple of hours rather than actually applying anywhere. Or how he sat at a table for five hours doing nothing more than staring at a paper rather than write a homework assignment because he didn't want to do an assignment that he didn't know the outcome of, whether it would be 'perfect'. 

Someone please help me figure out what I can be doing to help improve his quality of life. What services should I seek out that don't cost an arm and a leg?

I did not really understand why people are so obsessed with making friends and feel so sad when they don’t have, and I still do not really do yet. I did not have friends in all my childhood and preteen ages and I lived very happily. Like, I suppose that everyone here lives happily even without a space rocket. To me, friends were like space rockets. I was perfectly fine even without one.

But when I entered teenage years, and I got a new therapist, she kept to encourage me to make friends, and my family/school half forced me to, making me think that maybe I did need friends. Those two years became exhausting and stressful, because basically I was almost “forced” into to do something that I did not need to and that wasted my energy. I did not understand why.

These days I realised that actually I do perfectly fine even without friends and I always did, and that when my friends “left me”, I didn’t feel sad at all (even I should be, technically) and I felt fine. Like, I was like, yeah it happened, but it was not catastrophic.

See, when you go on internet and search loneliness, everything you find is how to fight it, how to not be lonely, how to accept it, but I realised I do not relate at all, like, if other people start to be stressed and sad because they are lonely, I was being the opposite, because I socialised too much.

I actually feel way more myself and free when I think that it is okay that I do not make friends and I can perfectly live in a society without making friends. Now, is this common among all the Aspergers or, most Aspies actually WANT friends but do not know how to make them?

I got diagnosed officially at 12 years old. I was almost 13.",1
"I feel like I'm a crackhead (embarrassed for addiction). They laugh at me another subreddits even the ones that are said to be supportive I hear (see) it more often than I should. 

For instance anytime when in an argument with someone, where they have a contrasting or opposite opinion of me, all they have to do is click on my profile and boom, this guy is like a 30-year-old unemployed weed addict and that is close to true. I'm a 27m odd job worker only a few times a week/month depending on what's available. Good summer hours, poor winter and spring/fall moderate. 

It is true I have an addiction to marijuana and I have taken great pleasure in the times that I've gone without it. 

I did 168 days without Alcohol last year the goal was to do a minimum of 145 days sacrificing my time (wallet and liver approve) for the 29 men who died on a great lakes (5) ship, The S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on November 10, 1975 and had $145 of 29 American 5 dollar bills ready for April 27th, as December 3rd was my last use date and didn't touch the money until May.  

But my two biggest breaks without smoking weed are just shy of 2 months, one of them in a leap year. I did 58 days last year (MR4-MY1) and 59 days in 2020 (FE15-AP14) to which unfortunately included a February 29th in that time. Otherwise I would've hit two months to the day. 

Now I struggle to go even a day without it. It seems much easier say when on vacation where I can't smoke for a week or two enjoying my time vs forced to go without because of financial struggles and sitting at home bored. It's common in most drug addicts to struggle financially but the legal weed here is cheap. Ounces generally go for $100-140 depending on quality. 

But I do feel some jealousy when some people can achieve goals like going say years without weed but everybody's different. There may be someone that hasn't went a week without smoking up in the past 10 years but has been without alcohol for decades and a proud of that. Others never used either but I don't feel I should be having to compare myself to others. I did go a near 16 years without smoking from birth to when I first used afterall LOL.  

Facebook I've been 8 months without, Video games 17 months, imagine those durations without for weed my dreams would get very intense, perhaps too intense at times. I'd rather be able to use say once a month consistently for years, that to go years without just to go right back to everyday again the moment I smoke up.",1
"Is it possible to diagnose ASD as an adult? I don't know if I have ASD or it's just Social anxiety combined with other behavioral issues.
When I searched online I have found that there is no definite test for diagnosing ASD. So can any of you please suggest me how to know for sure?",1
"i think i have Asperger's. or am i just different? so i think i \*may\* have Asperger's. i have ocd however fyi.

so i was more interest in things than in people. if i get bored or of something someone is doing, i do not stick around. i have my own strong interests and for this reason its really hard to make friends, iv always been and felt like a outsider, even in sports, and i like doing things my way! i started talking to adults more in my teen years since i hated the culture of others my age, there not good friends and are mean not anly that i struggle to play as its very rare to have similar interests as me

 although im overly talkative and go on tangents. i just don't connect to others its ALL surface. and i can't keep a conversation going very very well because i don't like to talk about things i don't like to talk about, if we talk about something i will go into EVERY DETAIL I CAN FIND. having a conversation or telling a story can turn into a maze.

i sometimes struggle with things like misunderstanding, assumptions, sarcasm, and seem to have a different sense of humour than anything else, if a joke is illogical its not funny(unless its clever or \*random\*) however i am a real joker(i find puns in every thing) i do understand unliteral things as i like finding hidden meanings in things so i have no problem understanding in this area and have become very philosophical i have a knack for understanding concepts(and putting two and two together) but cannot explain my thoughts well(iv always struggle to express my thoughts and ideas)

i like to think everything logically and im so curious and nosy i get told off for being so curious (why do you need to know, or that's rude)  im the king of oversharing and talking about the same thing way too much, i have to make sense of everything and can't stand conflicting information. way to open to other people. and often don't understand how friendships and social boundary's operate its hard to tell whats acceptable and whats not. i aften need someone to explain something in more detail for me to understand. i want to know how everything works and decode things... overthink everything. and i was bullied in school and targeted and called things and i don't know why. im not dumb i am just different. 

is obsessive apologising and need to explain yourself to others a common thing? i dread rejection and misunderstanding.

i am good at coordination/balance but i often make big errors in aim at times and instead of catching something i hit it. don't even ask me about writing and grammar...

people describe me as \*intense\* easily excitable.

i love eating with teaspoons, i have favourite things, i find objects cute, i love stimming for fun. and i unconsciously do it when stressed...

 idk about fashion or social norms. instead i can be very argumentative and try and impose my point across they have to know what i think and i try to use logic, i question things that most people do not. very technical at times. 

my only sensory issue i notice is high sensitivity to touch. i don't like being touched or restricted/crowded.  but despite this im always touching things and sometimes i do not feel it when i get scratched. idk whats your opinion pls?",1
"Is pacing around when anxious or engaged in conversation ""stimming""? Pacing around is a compulsive behaviour from my early teenage years that I only do now when I'm agitated, lost on thought, or talking on the phone (though I do prefer to walk and talk rather than sit and talk now that I think about it).

"Have you managed to remain friends with your ex? My now ex-girlfriend broke up with me (both aspies) last night due to distance, but wants to remain friends.

"I don't have trouble with changing routines when its reasonable and for good cause They say ASD folks are highly routinized and may have difficulty changing their routines, relative to NTs, I guess is implied there.

But actually, am I alone here?, I feel like I'm immensely more flexible than NTs in one very key way: making small adjustments to improve day-to-day routines/functions/processes when there is good reason to do so.

Because *if* a change in my routine has good cause/reason that I understand, it usually only takes me a few attempts to habituate the change and routinize it. Of course, I personally have to juror the reasonableness and agree that it is indeed good reason, but if I do come to believe that there is good reason for change I can make the change effortlessly, indeed, I will absolutely relish optimizing my routine with this new important insight. And I have a tendency to be impatient with folks struggling to update their ways.

NTs.... I feel like because they aren't so thoughtful and rationale-obsessed as I am, being given a good reason to change something doesn't have the same power on them that it does on me.  Like, even if they agree that I have given good reasons that we, as a household or work force, should do X thing ""my way,"" they aren't able to incorporate it quickly or easily, they apologize or make excuses, or slow roll and drag their feet so as to passive-aggressively lodge a complaint, even though I truly believe them when they say my rationale is very persuasive.  But if it's persuasive, how can it be difficult for them to remember it and implement it?   I've gone my whole life thinking people are lying to me when they say I have convinced them that i have good reason for my requests but then they don't follow the logic of my request.  Like.... what do I not understand? But now I'm starting to think it's just ND/NT difference, not dishonesty.

Example, multiple housemates leave dishes in their bedrooms.  I tell them to try to get into the habit of always bussing one set of dishes from their room to the kitchen each time you are headed to the kitchen for food (if not sooner), but they just can't seem to implement it, even though they agree this makes life much easier for them, the kitchen will no longer be perpetually depopulated of silverware and such, etc etc. Even though we all agree on what is optimal, folks still have a hard time doing that.  I can't really empathize. I only have trouble with unreasonable or poorly reasoned requests.",1
"Why is discussion of Asperger's as a life-ruining disease suppressed, while discussion of Asperger's as a ""superpower"" or as a ""personality quirk"" is encouraged? It is the root of my misery, it is the root of misery for millions, but when searching for support online you only ever see shit like ""it only means you think differently"", ""you can do things other's can't"", and ""your brain is just wired in other ways"". 

Do I need to remind people that most of those with Asperger's are not happily oblivious math gurus who effortlessly coast through life with their genius, but averagely-talented or untalented people trying to achieve normal lives but struggling to offer society the bare minimum, being proven every day that their best effort is insufficient? 
Asperger's sucks if you're an adult, it is a disability and not a "" le quirky personality UwU rawr :3"" that everyone mentions when someone asks for legitimate ways to make their own lives less of a torture.",1

Sorry if this is the wrong place Hi I have an 8 year old daughter who was diagnosed with Asperger’s a few years ago. Since October she started having panic attacks. They weren’t very often until a few weeks ago now she has them every other day but can’t explain to me why. I have no idea how to help her. Iv spoken to her school who said they get a someone to speak to her soon that was almost a month ago. I can’t get her a doctors appointment as there’s not enough to go around and it isn’t serious enough. I would love any advice.,1
"Navigating social media? I’m going to start this post by saying that I do not a diagnosis yet but I actually have had some non-neuropsych tests done in both childhood and when I was an adult that have shown it is likely I have high-functioning autism and I have some mental health professionals saying I have it as well. I’m having a neuropsych test soon!

Anyways, social media has always been a struggle for me. I’ve never really seen the purpose of posting your life for everyone to see. I actually did run a instagram account and Snapchat a few years ago but later closed them due to a fallout with a few people and getting hurtful messages. Even then I didn’t really post much outside of memes and my art. 

I don’t think I want to have a social media like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc. ever again. It seems hard, crafting posts, gaining a following, posting aspects of your life, knowing what to say, etc etc. I also don’t think I have enough friends for social media? I have a few sure but not a great amount. It seems like a rift between me and other people sometimes. I see people sharing snapchats and instagrams and I just don’t have one. And I feel awkward and uncomfortable about that but

Reddit seems different, I don’t know why. There are communities for the most specific of things and singular games and shows and I really like that. And it doesn’t seem reliant on building a following? Yet I still seem frozen on how to begin to interact? How to start building up an account and such

Does anyone here have any tips on how they do it? Or started to do it?",1

"What is being an Aspie to YOU? I have only been on r/aspergers for 1-2 weeks. I read a lot of comments with bitter language or people asking for help. There is this entire debate on how being an Aspie is (1) a Curse (2) a Superpower, (3) both (4) neither. I am of the 5th category (5) What is it??? I would love to know what people actually think and why.

My long, long analysis:

Personally, I have suffered from 20 years of depression, anxiety, and being called weird/special/unique for even longer. This has led me to bouts of suicidal ideation, self-harming, meltdowns, missed opportunities, and lost social relationships. More broadly, I never fit in, anywhere. However, my system-based thinking and analytical skills got me through a Ph.D. in biology (with literal blood, sweat, and tears). I see the curse, I see the superpower, I see the both and neither. However, these are all functional descriptors of Asperger's as a label that don't really describe what it IS.

What is Asperger's or ASD in actuality? The science seems tenuous at best. From what I can tell:

1) AS/ASD symptoms and behaviors manifest through interaction with the environment, increased stress, and reduced time and ability to choose how to process things exacerbate symptoms.

2) The genetic basis is shaky. Genetic studies suggest that contributing genes are in the 100s +, and unhelpful independent of the context/environment. 

3) Little is different from an NT brain at the level of individual brain cells (neurons) or even in the number, location, and development of neurons.

4) The neuronal connectivity avenue is most promising but research is still in its infancy. The best (so far?) evidence would suggest that the process of selecting specific brain cell connections (synaptic pruning) occurs less or differently. This would suggest that connectivity parameters are different and often skewed toward retaining more connections that are used in earlier stages of life (neoteny).

5) Sensory sensitivities overlap with hyper-analysis of details. Rather than increase sensitivity in actual sensation, the processing of sensation is amplified making a person more sensitive overall. E.g. eyes are not better at sensing light at a molecular level, but that processing visual information is amplified and thus a person is more sensitive to light.

Conclusion and speculations: AS/ASD is a set of neural networking differences that are under the umbrella of the ""Autism Spectrum"". ASD might even be a collection of networking differences at different scales and locations within the brain that are sensitive to relative timings to what happens in a person's life. This might be why the ""High-functioning"" vs ""low-functioning"" distinction makes me and many others cringe, I am ""high-functioning"" in certain circumstances and ""low-functioning"" in others. Since neural connections within humans change over their life, this might also explain why symptoms can manifest late or even go away. Just food for thought.",1
"Female advice-help please 
I need some advice before I send myself crazy. I’m a 31F and my partner is 30M. I’m his second partner and he has been told before he has mild Asperger’s as a child( this will be important further down). We have been together for four years and also engaged. I am a female who can only orga*m via cl*t stimulation and my favourite thing is oral. When we first got together, we were having s*x and he stopped and told me that my vagi*a smelt bad. I know it didn’t as I have really good hygiene. This really broke me and made me extremely self-conscious ever since this day. He has never gone down on me at all ever and our s*x life consist of him doing his business and I generally just finish myself off with satisfier pro. Occasionally he will play with my brea*t whilst I make myself go with my toy. I can count on one hand how many times he has touched downstairs. Tonight we decided to do the usual of me making myself go with my toy and him playing with my brea*t not long after he started playing with them he stopped and said something smelt ask asked if it was b**b sweat as I have very large brea*t ( I checked and no smell). I always check my odour before doing anything and I knew that it wasn’t me so I told him just to not worry about it and he left the room. Ive always liked oral being performed on me and now I haven’t had it in over four years. I honestly don’t know what to do from here. Our s*x life is so boring and it’s the same thing every time which is not very enjoyable for me. I brought some extra toys to maybe spice it up and now he said he feels like they will be better than him. I understand having autism can cause some people to have an extreme sensitive sense of smell so this is why I’m really torn. Do I want to live the rest of my life never been pleasured
again? All this is really affecting our relationship and I love I have for him. I don’t know whether I’m happy to continue to meet his s*x demands but not mine ( I’ve always put him first) 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺. And the tough thing is, I know he feels bad and apologies for making me feel gross. My brain is literally at a point of questioning my own s*xuality.  If he didn’t have Asperger’s I would say he is just being selfish but I don’t know how to overcome this. I’ve been extremely patient with him and I’ve broken to pieces ( he doesn’t mean to be mean but just says it how it is- no filter). Ahhhhh I’m so torn.",1

"How to help my child’s friendship with a friends kid that may have Asperger’s. I hope this is the appropriate place to ask, please let me know if not. 

One of my closest friends has a child that may have suspected Asperger’s. She’s almost 5 and nothing has been ‘officially’ diagnosed yet, but she’s going through tests. My kid is around the same age so we get together regularly to hang out and so the kids can play. Now, my friends daughter can be the most lovely kid- caring, inclusive, etc etc. However, at the drop of a hat, can do a 180 and be downright mean toward my daughter- doesn’t want her to play with any of her stuff, specifically says _linzertorte_’s daughter needs to leave, also tries to get my attention and not have me pay attention to my own kid, etc etc. 

I don’t want to discourage my daughter from trying to have a friendship with my friends daughter, but she has said to me a few times that she wishes friends daughter could play more nicely. I’ve explained to her that all kids have trouble playing nicely sometimes, but know that with this kid in particular something more is likely going on. 

I guess what I’m looking for is how can I help foster a positive relationship between these 2 kids while not seeming like there’s pressure being put on either of them to be friends. I know kids of parent-friends don’t have to get along, I just want to do what I can to support friendship development in this case because my friends kid will likely have a hard time as she gets older. I also realize that I may be personalizing what I observe between the two of them, so open to hearing any input on this situation!",1
"I Hate Sobriety (Alcohol) Fell off the wagon at Christmas (I used to love it, now I hate it) and I kept drinking. About a week sober now and I hate it. 

Since I started drinking at 18 the longest I have been sober is 8 months and it never got easier. Alcohol just tones the world down and makes it bearable. I can socialise after a little whiskey, it got me over my fear of flying (couldn't get xanax from my psychiatrist, they believe it's prescribed too much), it helped me focus. I miss functional alcoholism.

Unfortunately after a decade of it, it got out of control and now if I drink I can't stop. I can drink a litre and if I could afford it I'd probably drink more. So I kinda have to stop. My liver has minor damage but it shouldn't be permanent. Alcohol withdrawal is hell.

I also have responsibilities so I can't really afford to be drunk all the time.

Not really sure what the point of this post is, I just needed to vent somewhere I guess.",1
"Well…my ADHD covered up the Asperger’s. I just recently got diagnosed with Asperger’s. For years my ADHD overcompensated by making me talk constantly because I was bored. Though, I always remembered not wanting to talk and wishing that I’d just shut up because I didn’t even LIKE talking, but it was an impulse. I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 15 (even after telling my parents for YEARS that I had it. It was super obvious, too, but teachers just thought I was spoiled and my parents just thought I was being a “girl” as I am the only girl they had). After being medicated I became quieter to the point that one of my friends thought I didn’t like her anymore because it became difficult for me to hold a conversation with her. I started going to therapy and it was my therapist to started to notice the Asperger’s symptoms. Lack of eye contact, special interests, some selective mutism (which only developed after being medicated for adhd and bipolar disorder because the impulse of talking went away), sensory issues, auditory processing issues, and hyperlexia (hyperlexia is sometimes seen in individuals with Asperger’s but it’s often not talked about). However, I’m extremely empathetic (like, a true empath) and I’m quite emotional so most people thought there was no way I could have Asperger’s but the lack of empathy and emotion are pretty stereotypical. It’s common, but it isn’t always the case. For a long time that was what made me think I wasn’t on the spectrum at all. That and the fact that I said my first word at 6 months old, but it took me much longer to begin walking…and instead of crawling I rolled everywhere. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Now I tend to go mute when I am overwhelmed or anxious, and I can become snippy when I’m focusing on something and someone tries to interrupt my focus. Also, having ADHD and Asperger’s makes me crave order, but makes it impossible for me to have order in most aspects of my life. 

Apologies for such a long post. I tend to write novels when I’m making a post or even texting someone casually. Most people get really annoyed by it so I apologize by default now.",1

"I've been thinking about double empathy and language acquisition as a child Double empathy demonstrates that in interactions between autistics and non autistics misunderstandings and miscommunications occur far more often than between autistics and autistics or between neurotypicals. 


This empathy required in communication would certainly come into play regarding a child's acquisition of their native language. So hypothetically a child raised by Neurotypical parents might have more trouble acquiring language and the meaning of words and phrases than a child with (an) autistic parent(s). I however doubt that any difficulties or delays would be easily noticeable. This would require a large scale study of of many families over a long period of time and there's many factors to take into account.

"It’s becoming unbearable The social isolation and constant rejection of friendships and romantic interests has really begun weighing on me again. Last time it got this bad I ended up going about five years without socializing beyond what was required to stay employed.

I was just told yesterday by an old high school friend that I’m too quirky for normal people, but even the quirky girls want nothing to do with me since there’s plenty of normal men who like that type of thing. 

The only times I’ve ever had a girlfriend is when I ignored them (I had just assumed they were too good for me so I didn’t bother trying to talk to them) until they literally sat on my lap and made out with me or asked me how many signals they needed to send. That’s happened three times in my life, but I’m nearly 40 and balding and there aren’t really those types of situations with regular interactions to lead to that type of luck anymore so I can’t count on it. 

It seems so bizarre to me that a person would be attracted to someone they perceived as treating them coldly but are not attracted at all if any interest is shown.

Thinking about these things is painful but not thinking about them means I just be content with not doing anything so effectively becoming a hermit. It’s peaceful and I don’t have to tell you all how much fun can actually be had, but it really takes a lot of work to actively uproot the desire to have a friend or life partner.

"People on the Spectrum and honor-shame cultures What exactly is the relationship between people on the autism spectrum and honor-shame cultures, as are found in pretty much all of the continent of Asia, North Africa, and until relatively recently, Eastern and Southern Europe? I ask as a white American man who has traveled across Russia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, and is now knee deep in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and trying to understand where the Arab side is coming from.

[I'm finding little to like, relate to, or imagine myself ever adapting to](https://www.nabataea.net/explore/culture_and_religion/honorshame/), the more I learn and understand. My understanding is that the *sine qua non* of ASD is difficulty in reading people and social situations. Asian cultures, especially Arab culture, seem to require a level of constant and keen social awareness I couldn't possibly aspire to, no matter how hard I tried. My status in Arab, Indian, Chinese, Russian, or Japanese society would always be quite low. I would attract much shame.

But then again, what does it matter? I *am not* Arab or Chinese, and will never have any idea what it might feel like to be raised in one of these honor-shame cultures. I can read about the East and spend as much time there as I want, and I will still filter anything I learn through my upbringing as a Westerner to the core.

I have two theories, which aren't mutually exclusive. The first is that honor-shame cultures simply produce a lot, *lot* fewer people with ASD than my home USA. The same complex soup of environmental and societal pressures that select for a strong honor-shame culture, are the same ones that produce overwhelmingly individuals who have what it takes, cognitively and behaviorally, to survive in such a culture, and not so many people like me who don't. And, by the same token, my own American Western culture has evolved and is evolving in such a direction that *does not* select out nearly as many people whose minds work like mine anymore. In other words, each one of us is more a part and product of the geography, both natural and human, that begat us, than we realize. Saying that I wouldn't make a very good Indian is similar to saying that a fish can't breathe air. Maybe an equal number of people with ASD are conceived in the East, but far fewer of them survive long enough to have children themselves.

My second theory is that people with ASD are born and thrive in honor-shame cultures at equal rates to my own culture, but they cope in a very different way from most people with ASD from my culture, that we would readily neither recognize nor relate to. I say this having been raised in, and adapted to, a cultural bubble of Christian leftist social justice warriors in the USA. The way this has shaped me, has left me deeply ambivalent on the emerging ""Aspie culture"", which largely embraces nihilism, atheism, libertarianism/ classical liberalism, the extremes of geek culture, knowledge-based pissing contests, and a preference for dealing with machines over people. I imagine that the cultures and subcultures one is raised in, and how they do and don't accommodate a person with diminished people smarts, will have a massive effect on how the person copes with these limitations. For example, I can picture an Aspie from an Eastern culture leaning quite hard into meticulously learning the numerous little unspoken rules of their culture's social interaction, and having a rich inner world that's starkly different from their pubic persona, which feels ""mask-like"" but necessary to them.

Would someone in this community who was raised in a typical honor-shame culture, as is the norm in all of Asia, North Africa, and to a lesser extent Eastern and Southern Europe, care to weigh in on this? Are there aspects of *Western* Aspie culture, either online or IRL, that *you* find puzzling or don't relate to?",1
"Growing up in church From when I was a kid I enjoyed church, the part where you sit down for service and just absorb information or taking part in service. The socialising part was always really difficult for me though. I would need to withdraw myself right after church. For a long time I didn’t realise I was struggling with my mental health. I would have mini panic/anxiety attacks. Like whenever I preached I would burst into tears and cry uncontrollably. I had no clue why. I’m not as active in church as much (I would like to be) as I used to be but I feel like people don’t really understand what I go through in order to simply fit in and try to be accepted. I feel like if I did people would just brush it off or say I’m not experiencing God correctly. Sometimes I feel like my church experience is just me conforming and I didn’t really advocate for my needs very well. I started developing a really good mask for church as well. I wasn’t doing anything bad or living a double life but I would guilt trip myself over the smallest things. I find it hard to say no to people. I’m saying all this to say, I’m really trying to find community where I can just be myself to be honest. Where I don’t feel like a fraud and I don’t want to be worshiped, I just don’t want my needs neglected. Friends on the same wavelength.",1
"I wish I was intelligent or had a talent I’m one of these who can’t do anything, I can’t even do simple tasks sometimes and I get confused by the simplest things.

I hate this shit world.",1
"Satisfied with myself, yet feeling alone ""I'm better off all by myself, thought i'm kinda feeling empty without somebody else"" has been the quote that i've been related the most lately

I'm really happy with myself, in fact most of the best moments of my life were when i was having fun alone either playing videogames or singing at home, but there's still a part of me that would like to have some special company, yknow?

It's just so... sad seeing everybody around me have or at least has a relationship while i feel i'm almost a repulsor of people just by being myself

Like, i don't consider myself a bad or unpleasant people, my friends and parents always tell me how much they love me and likes being together with me, but since i've learned that i'm socially weird enough to not attract nobody due to how much i don't actually care if i'm acting weird between people who don't know me, i don't feel my social circle is gonna grow or even not decrease

I'm also really happy with my friends, but it's been more than two months i've lost any disposition or willing of chatting with them—actually, with everybody besides my parents and sisters— that i'm finding myself on a empty hole where eventually i'll be alone 

I feel i'm discovering myself as a incel and... does it has anything to do with autism? Althought not having a font right now, i've read a post talking about a unexpectedly huge percentage of the incels were also autistic (it was on r/ForeverAlone, i guess) and it stuck in my mind since them, any thoughts about it?

 today i'm just feeling empty and well, this post ended up the same way",1
"Our elders are mostly dead; what ASD folks have in common with gay men I'm 40s.  Grew up on the very tale end of the AIDS crisis, so you might say I'm among the eldest generation of gay men alive today most of whom did not have to worry about dying of AIDS (although we can still get HIV, there is no practical reason anymore to die from AIDS).  Anyone much older than me, their numbers were severely thinned by the AIDS crisis.  Perhaps because both my biological grandfathers were dead before I was born, and I had only sisters, and my father didn't like me, I always felt a tremendous loss there, an absence in elder roll models I, as a human being, should have but did/do not.  The gay men ages 60s and 70s alive today... let's just say most of them had some pretty conservative lifestyles during the AIDS crisis to have survived, making them not exactly my role model (there are people with HIV immunity, but they are few -- I met one once).

And now being newly diagnosed ASD, I'm beginning to realize that without any particular data or proof, I think it's the same situation all over again.  Undiagnosed ASD folks would certainly be higher risk for death, imprisonment, etc., at all stages of life but especially midlife getting into old age.  So we know people my age and older were not diagnosed as kids, we know ""the system"" isn't robust enough to get caught up so any midlife ASD person who is still alive is more likely than not to die undiagnosed (and I would guess being an undiagnosed autistic on average puts you in line for early death)

And so here I am again, downline the family tree without role models to look up at.  Again going through life with virtually no one with any real standing to say ""I understand what you're going through.""",1
"Autism destroyed my chance of getting the dream job and I wasted my 20s trying. In therapy FYI

My 20s:I worked fast food, lived  in a prison cell flea infested home with a creepy old man during my  internship, cleaned boats from sunrise to  sunset, lived in a bed bug  infested white trash crackhead house (got scars) where someone drugged  me just for a laugh while his dog attacked mine several times, worked  with racists in Texas, covid took away that job, lost my dog, then I  went to live on a god forsaken island in another prison cell sized  apartment that costed $1200 per month despite the shit water seeping  from the ground when I flushed (I was making only $13 per hour), then I  came to a new career-launching job as a scuba diver at an Aquarium and  got fired in 3 months all cuz my boss didn’t  wanna work harder or  change his coaching methods for an autistic worker so he came up with a  bullshit reason to fire me. I’ve fought so hard….and I’ve been single  and alone throughout all of it. Minus my dog, but now she's gone...

I have lost… I gave my diving career 8 years of my life…8 fucking years  of hard fucking work. I’m tired…and autism makes the human aspect just too hard. I thought I could overcome it, but I can’t fake a personality and hate eye contact. After being fired cuz of it…I’m defeated. I have  NOTHING! I'm unemployed now, relying on my savings. I'm still single at  age 30 with not ONE woman ever  romantically loving me. I live in a small apartment all alone living in a fucking red state.

Unemployment benefits were REJECTED. I'm a short (5'7"") autistic, loser with an ugly face who has no friends, no lover, NOTHING! I wasted my 20s working so  hard to pursue the dreams of a stupid little boy thinking he could overcome any challenge with hard work.

I failed...and now I cross the streets without looking both ways. Hoping  for a car to hit me and finish the job so it's not a suicide. What's the  point anymore of going on? Not like I have a beautiful woman waiting  for me or a dog who needs me to care for her.

"How do I fight the feeling of never being given a chance Before I was even 4, I was (in, my opinion wrongfully) diagnosed with autism, dumped in a special ed program that traumatized me until the 8th grade, was put into a decent high school program that was built in to a really good specialized school but my own motivation issues and unresolved trauma resulted in me never getting the chance to take classes there and I am so sick of everything. I have posted about this before, even basically told my whole life story to different sub reddits only for no one to respond. Why is it that while some kids were put in gifted programs or were in general ed all there life taking the hard classes with dozens of consistently supportive friends, I never got to expirence that, it's not fair it's not fair and now I won't even get to a good college because of how bad my GPA is.

"Is there a way to find out if I am misdiagnosed? I've been diagnosed with asd for about half a year and it answered some questions.Especially why I have strange taste in food and why people think of me as a weirdo.Whoever, there are some things that make me question my diagnosis and if it's right/ the right diagnosis.They go as follows:

\-not really any problems with sound,unless I'm angry/pissed

\-I am immune to lights,unless there too bright and/or changing too fast

\-someone told me that my recent therapist isn't really that professional, and through my personal experience I've noticed that too,so maybe things resulting from my social anxiety could be misinterpreted as asd

\-verbal and nonverbal communication got complicated after noticing the signs of social anxiety,there were only a handful of things I didn't understand and before that talking to others wasn't a problem at all

Of course I am aware that people with autism don't have the exact same experiences,but I genuinely struggle way less than most of my friends with asd,same as I genuiely see people struggle more than I do. So my question is:

Is there a way to make sure I haven't been misdiagnosed? If so, please tell me,it would help a lot honestly",1
"Anyone here with an Asperger parent and willing to share his/her story? I (38m, NT but with mental health issues) grew up with a very odd and emotionally absent father. After many years of confusion and a lot of frustration I came across the topic of AS and it was a perfect explanation. I never talked about it too my father because I always have to walk in eggshells around him and I don't want him to freak out. My mother doesn't want him to get checked because of her fear of stigma and shame. So there probably won't be a diagnosis but I'm convinced that he is a Asperger and finally I have some sense of peace with and understanding for him.

My question is: are there any children of Asperger parents here that would share their experiences growing up with such a parent?

From the beginning of my first childhood memories I remember my father as a nice and very generous and loyal person but emotionally completely unavailable, always (!!) busy with his special interests (doing ""useless"" things on the computer and collecting and sorting stuff like audio cassettes, CDs, copying vast amounts of audio books from the local library - everything without listening to all of it even once etc) but hardly there for his family, again and again having some sort of social drama (with neighbors, colleagues, family, random people on the phone etc), very reduced communication, being known for a very strange and often very rude or offending sense of humor, having complete meltdowns for reasons that were very hard to understand. He generally was always very unpredictable regarding his actions and reactions and and up to this day I would consider him as the only person I know I really can't ""read"".

Growing up with my father I developed some serious psychological problems like socal anxiety and depression. I never felt seen, understood or enough and developed a deep pain and loneliness due to it. I still have a deep fear that people might lash out on me for absolutely minor or seemingly ridiculous reasons which caused a lot of problems especially at college and my jobs. To summarize it I would say that there is no stability nor peace within me and that it was largely caused by all the confusing, frustrating and painful experiences with my father. So that's my story. I'd be happy to read some other stories. Thank you so much.",1

Anyone else see the serious issues with the fact that we diagnose autism in psychology/psychiatry practices? I experience autism as a sensory condition first, a cognitive condition second, and I could honestly give a damn about the about whether resultant behaviors when I’m in an environment or social situation that’s not accessible for my neurotype are socially acceptable. We seriously evaluate this condition on the criteria of how socially unacceptable our behavior is? We completely ignore the underlying mechanism/root cause of the behavior? Come on now… I smell bullshit.

"After 20 years of waiting, I finally got my ears pierced today CW: needles, blood

30M, live in the UK.

First got the idea to get my ears pierced (well, just the left one, to be honest) when I was about 10, but kept putting it off for a number of reasons. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to book a consultation appointment at a studio about 40 minutes away from me by train. Went up today, and got there on time. The piercer who was assigned to me for the consultation was brilliant - we clicked pretty much instantly. It's an LGBTQ+-friendly space, which - given I'm gay - was quite a draw when I was doing my research. And trust me when I say I did quite a bit of research into different jewellery options! The piercer I had was very extensive about the detail she went into, and she could tell I was interested in the whole process. She was very impressed at the level of research I'd done.

After having a look at some of the jewellery options, I was given a few minutes to think about it, and I eventually made my decision to go ahead with it. Made my choice of jewellery (which she actually said she thought I'd go for when I initially mentioned that particular style), filled out the consent form, and had to get some cash out from somewhere while the jewellery was sterilised - for the record, I wasn't aware of this beforehand, and it's only because the reception in the studio isn't good enough for a card machine. Given I used to volunteer in a Christian bookshop where we'd have to take the card machine outside for it to work, I can sympathise! Eventually returned, and went through to one of the rooms where I was able to see everything get set up. The set-up took a fair bit of time, and I did ask for the marks on my lobes to be repositioned so they were slightly higher, which was completely fine. Ears were cleaned before and after the marks went on my ears, then it was time for the clamp to go on.

It was time.

I gave my consent for the right lobe to be done, breathed in, and then breathed out. It was over fairly quickly, and then the jewellery went in. Took a few seconds, and then the left lobe was done through the same process. Ended up having a bit of blood from the left one, but I was told this does happen sometimes. Went to the mirror to have a look, and I was so happy. The 20-year wait was worth it. Got given a leaflet on aftercare, a bottle of sterile saline solution for the aftercare, and a couple of stickers for being a brave boy. We were then done, and I left, feeling so happy that it was finally done. Need to go back in a few weeks' time to get the posts downsized (they put longer ones in to account for swelling during the healing process), but that's not a problem. Decided to treat myself afterwards by getting a few books and a couple of LEGO models (if anyone's interested, I got a freebie due to spending a certain amount in total, and the main item was the DeLorean from *Back to the Future*) before then heading to the station to go home.

So, was I happy with my decision? Yes. Absolutely. It's gonna take some getting used to, but I'm sure I'll be OK. My parents have absolutely no idea, as they've gone away for the weekend, but I'll have to talk to them about it when they return. They can't try to claim I haven't done my research, because I definitely have. Also, it's not like I've gone and got something really insane - the studs look quite simple and classy. It was on the expensive side (£120 including the initial deposit), but that's no problem. I wanted to make sure I got them done properly.

If anyone wants to see the photos, they're on my profile. If anyone has any questions, I'm more than happy to try and answer them.",1
"Others making plans for you. Ugh. Just happened. A grandmother encouraging her niece to join me (32F) on my daily walk around town (small mountain village, nobody around and trees and peace).

I usually don't even want my dad to come with me because I like to be alone with my thoughts and relax before I dive back into work.

Why do people think it's OK to schedule themselves into other people's free time?",1
"ASD PSA ""Sorry"" has two meanings In the context of for example someone's relative dying it is common in English for one to say ""I'm sorry"" but the person saying sorry in this situation is not responsible for the death of said relative and is not asking forgiveness. 
Sorry as defined by webster's online dictionary is as follows:
feeling sorrow or sympathy
I'm so sorry for your loss.
We were very sorry to hear the news.
She felt sorry for him. [=she felt sympathy and concern for him because of his situation, problems, etc.]
He told me to stop feeling sorry for myself. [=to stop indulging in self-pity


But that's not the main definition or use of the word. The main use and definition is as follows:
feeling regret or penitence
He was sorry about what he had said.
""I wanted to apologize,"" she said, ""for my abominable rudeness in laughing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know why I did it. I'm sorry.""

Many autistics who grow up in an English speaking culture/environment (which includes me) will pick up on the second given definition of ""Sorry"" without problem while acquiring the language. The first give Definition often eludes and confuses us UNLESS we happen to look up the definitions of  word sorry in a dictionary or encyclopedia which I did. 

What other words confuse you?",1
"Have you ever felt that you have reached your limit of possible interests? Recently, I have been struggling with finding/starting new interests as of late.  
I have gotten all my current special interests to a level where it is hard to even keep them up  
to standard. (The further I am, the easier it becomes to get rusty, so I keep them in my schedule.)

I always have this nagging sensation in the back of my mind to dive into something new,  
like music, history, industrial engineering, or whatever that grabs my attention.  
But it never fits my schedule, and I always have to sacrifice something to get into something new.

I found my limit at having a full-time job and two special interests.  
If I put a third one into the mix, I will get burned out in 1 to 2 months.

"How to not be hurt by people's perception of autism/bullying? Yeah... 

I'm not trying to bring the vibes down, but I'm kinda sad, you guys. Gonna put a TLDR but also need to vent a little bit. I'm starting to feel the impact and hurt of people's cruelty. I'm sick of hearing autism used as a punchline, but don't see it ending soon. How to deflect? Detach? 

Getting diagnosed has been one of the best things to happen to me. It was scary at first- I felt solidified as ""different"" and was, you know, shocked. For many reasons, but also because I'd heard people be mean about it. I was terrified to be vulnerable to that. 

Since diagnosis, the more I learn about autism and our community(ies?), the more I love myself. I feel proud to be autistic. I genuinely love who I am. I love my friends on the spectrum. We are some of the funniest, most compassionate, sweetest, genuine, and brilliant people. However, NTs are SO unkind to us. It comes up even in my ""safe"" spaces. 

One of my older autistic friends has been helping me process my diagnosis. He had shared his experience getting bullied with me before, as we often talk about autism. When he explained the phenomenological compound of being ridiculed, bullied, demeaned, etc. his entire life (he didn't get diagnosed until his late 20s either, he's in his 40s now) and the internal defenses resulting from that, I understood objectively and sympathized, but didn't ""feel"" it entirely. 

Now I see it everywhere, even when I try not to look. It's all online so taking a break from the internet seems apt. That's not a permanent solution though and I don't see people stopping. My instinct has been to shut my feelings down and ""stop being dramatic"" and ""sensitive"" about this, but that instinct seems to be another ill-effect of this bullshit. 

TLDR: people are mean. It's getting to me. How to not feel this way?",1
"If you have ADHD, does it cancel out some problems faced by most aspies? I myself have no problem with a change to routine. Well, the ADHD keeps me from developing routines anyway, but if there's a change in the weekly TV lineup or the job routine is messed up then I don't freak out the way some on the spectrum do.

Also, I think I'm able to mask a little better than most aspies. Talking to girls isn't a problem with me (thanks red pill) but I do feel that once I make the connection, I have a harder time at maintaining it than other aspies that can make connections.

They're going through a lot right now, and I want to be there for them, but I don't have the experience to fully understand what they're going through, and I don't know what to say or do (especially since it's a long-distance friendship) in order to be there for them.

We're all very excited about tonight, we're having dinner in a fancy restaurant and after that we're going to the club, I even composed some sort of ironic rap-poetry that sums up the members and the spirit of the group, we're all dressing ourselves up. But for some reason, while scrolling YouTube at home, a sad song comes up to my mind, and within five minutes I feel depressed, sad and empty, and I can't understand why.

Did this ever happened to you? How did you deal with it?",1
"Unsolicited advice fast tracks social alienation; empathize instead. Neurotypicals do this too but it seems to be far more pervasive among aspies. I'm talking about giving unsolicited advice.

* Have you ever vented to someone? Why did you vent? What were you hoping to receive by venting?
* Have you ever shared with someone something great that happened to you? Why and what did you hope to receive?

If you are looking for advice, chances are that you communicate that: ""What do you think about X?"" ""What would you do in X situation?"" ""Why do you think X happened?""

Giving unsolicited advice isn't always upsetting. But why gamble when you can simply ask if you can offer advice? ""Can I offer a suggestion?"" ""Can I offer my perspective?""

The gamble, however, may be worth taking if it's important enough to intervene, e.g., someone is about to seriously harm oneself. Understanding people understand that the gamble is worth it in those instances and may even appreciate it the intervention because the intervention demonstrates care and good judgment.

But in unimportant instances, unsolicited advice often undermines rapport. *This is because when people vent or share, they are looking to build connections, not to solicit advice.* In fact, it is often the case that they already know what to do; they just want to socialize by building connections. When you give unsolicited advice in these instances, you convey that you're not understanding them on a deep, fundamental level while also implying that they are inadequate.

This is why unsolicited advice fast tracks social alienation.

Instead of unsolicited advice, just empathize: ""No way! That's terrible."" ""That's fantastic news!"" ""Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.""

Empathizing may feel awkward at first but over time, you'll replace the habit of giving unsolicited advice with empathy, and you'll come to enjoy empathy because you'll come to enjoy building connections with people.

"DAE feel guilty and/or bad after socializing too much? How to deal with it? Does anyone else feel something like guilty and bad for no particular reason after socializing too much (defining ""too much"" as ""more than you feel like doing in a single day"")?

It is like when you are afraid you have made some big mistakes while talking (so big that other people have understood something different from what you were trying to communicate) but, as no one can read other's mind, neither you nor the other person you talked with knows it.

This happens usually while in bed waiting to get asleep but sometimes also randomly during the day, during and after social interactions.

When these feelings start, in my head the path is always the same: ""Did I say this correctly?"", ""Did he understood what I mean?"", ""Maybe I didn't understood what she said"" and so on, up until ""Please I want to explode, I can't stand all of this anymore"".

Do you have any suggestion on how to deal with this?",1
"is freedom truly real? Ideology of freedom

I see alot of aspies wanting freedom so i ponder and this is the cause

Im also working on my literature so maybe i will write books in my basement one day Heh heh

""Imo"" You Cant have freedom in a society 
Because of manipulation 



Even people that are free can be manipulated into a choice Even under the guise of their own free will. That is because they also desire that choice, but they realise that isnt freedom. so they go with a different choice... And now theres a dilemma 

Its not truly freedom is it? Its more of a form of control yes you have the freedom to choose but you were suppressed into that choice because of a sense of oppression so is your freedom truly free? lt's not what you desired. 

So i guess theres another point i have to make..

Is happiness more important than ""freedom""
And can they coexist?

To portray freedom more accurately im going to tell a story of a man 

With that choice made from above he was happy ""he"" found love with love comes motivation and motivation brings dedication. Yet he felt something missing and so he ponder for a while and eventually he came to a conclusion. That a cage no matter how shiny and prosperous it's still nothing but a cage. You may find everything in that cage that brings you happiness and you could probably survival longer in the cage than outside. but unfortunately humans are creatures tempted by greed there will always want more and MORE  ""what's outside the cage he ponder "" yet human are rationally and intelligent and will weigh the con against the pros.. Yet this human was satisfied so he dares not risk his life

 well untill his lover died it was quite unfortunate and he was depressed, but oh well. he lost his happiness and one day he looked out the cage than more days pass then it happened he stepped out due to curiosity . But He found nothing... everything was gone and nothing existed.


This human couldnt have both because of obvious choices 

1. He lived in a cage 
2. He didnt make steps into trying to be free earlier than he did because being happy is more important than being free for the *majority* 
3. He was weak 

Another etc story 

I am weak so i cant be free i can be framed for crimes i havent done... But because im unimportant the government could deem me as an invaluable asset and use me as a scapegoat. I have no dignity and reputation as im a poor man with no family and my friends were payedoff and that i was framed 

Can you say for certain that every action of yours wasnt under a form of manipulation


Do u see you cant be free in a society of humans unless

1.  you have superpowers to go against the world

 2. you live in complete human isolation

"Does anyone else on the spectrum find it impossible to find a job that fits them? How many jobs have you been through? I was diagnosed in my mid 20's and now am mid 30's so a decade of being in therapy and still cant find stuff and go back to retail.

Job A was in a retail store produce department and I hated people tearing up the displays after I worked hard facing them. I couldnt stand people talking to me other than coworkers. 

Job B was retail bakery. I loved the bakery even after having to give up sugar for my diet. Loved the wrap and talking to people at the table working on the racks of wrap. I hated customers coming up and interrupting us. I hated having to pick up the phone. The only customer I liked was this regular guy who picked up a bread order the only customer I connected with. I couldn't stand being interrupted by customers constantly and the karens who lied about ordering a cake and when we didnt have it they wanted a free cake or a discount.

Job C pizza place. Despite not having customers I hated it. Making pizzas. Having to stand around and wait for the new orders to come in. Because it was Dominos the menu was so big I could never understand it.

Job D telemarketing. I felt like a scumbag because it targeted old people. I remember calling up an old guy during the March madness basketball tournament and he was furious that I interrupted him watching the game. 

Job E. Retail deli. I hated rotisserie chickens because you'd get chicken blood all over you. You had to scrub countless skewers by hand and the room with the ovens was greasy and slippery. The ovens were hot and to make matters worse customers stare at you when you get the chickens out of the oven.

Job F. Chipotle. Manager hired me and threw me on the dishwasher and underpaid me. I lasted 2 days. I told him I wanted to learn how to cook professionally and didnt like dishwashing he didnt care so I bailed.

Job G: Retail meat department. My manager there promised me the moon and the stars. It was the highest paying job I ever had at $17 an hour. But he lied about the hours. I only got 24 hours a week when I was supposed to be full time. It was a service case which meant trays with dividers you had to spend forever washing. Customers would come up and you had to constantly weigh their meats and wrap them in butcher paper and label them. As a result you were stuck behind a counter your entire shift which drove me crazy. I quit due to the lack of hours. 

Job H. Starbucks. Was a very fun job but they only give you 5 and a half hour shift a day and you are capped at 25 hours a week. Also the shift leads kept me on register and I only really felt comfortable on bar. Couldnt stand standing for hours in one place and constantly talking to an endless line of customers.",1

"Do you struggle with bullying, because you don't know your being bullied? Serious question, how can you tell if you're being bullied? I keep facing disrespect by people but my first instinct is to think ""oh it's because I'm anti-social/awkward"" but I can't tell when it's fair or not. I was made fun a lot by ""friends"" so I'm used to it, I was an easy target. I don't seem to pick up on social hierarchy very well. It's just so lonely the amount of rejection I face from peers and I can't tell if I'm being unfairly treated or is it fair to say I'm at fault? 

For context I had a coworker make fun of me on social media for being awkward. I shut down in situations like this and I don't know how to tell people to fuck off or even gain respectability. Is this a sign of autism? I don't understand social shit at all, I've been manipulated and taken advantage of so at this point my own life has become one giant cope. I've had shit spoken to me in person, and I physically mentally etc can't speak back to them or understand their intentions? It's all blank to me. I'll respond bluntly or not no what to say. 

&#x200B;

What I guess I'm asking for is advice on assertiveness or how you deal with disrespect from an autistic POV. Do you literally just have to cope? It's really hard for me to fight back unless it's physical, in which case I've surprisingly been able to come out on top. Verbally I am vulnerable.",1
"Boyfriends abusive behaviour a result of ASD? So my boyfriend was diagnosed with Asperger’s roughly around 2 years ago. We met roughly around a year ago and the topic of his autism is something that has caused issues in our relationship.

He did disclose that he was Autistic prior to us becoming serious because he wanted me to know what I was “getting myself into” which I thought was odd but didn’t bother me whatsoever because I didn’t see why that would stop me from loving him as a person. 

Anyways to get to the main point. He has a tendency of getting what I would call verbally abusive whenever I do something to upset him unintentionally or if he feels unheard by me. It first starts with him breaking up with me and then changing his mind the next day saying he was just upset. He tends to have what he calls manic episodes where he threatens to expose me to my family members or call me degrading names. Again he says that this change in his mood and anger towards me comes from a deep feeling of being hurt by something I’ve done and he says it’s the only way he can communicate his feelings due to him being autistic. At first I’ve dismissed his claims saying that it was unfair for him to say that saying  nasty things to me was a direct correlation of his autism. But I do want to know if it may be. 

It’s caused a strain in our relationship as I tend to get very upset with the things he has said to me and isolate myself from him for a while to calm down for a day or two which only escalates the situation. When I get upset he often is apologetic for what he has says and tells me that I should have taken him more seriously when he told me about his diagnosis and that he doesn’t mean what he says he just has impulsive thoughts.",1

"When you listen to someone talk about their experiences and feelings, do you just ""hear words"" or feel with them and imagine their perspective? So I was just watching a Vice panel on masculinity. I'm a woman and I got a slight instrospective observation abt myself. I was listening to this man talk about how he feels scared to do certain things cus he will be seen as less of a man. I suddenly realised that all I'm registering this as is words, like I'm not trying to imagine anything(except visuals), I don't feel much empathy even, like I'm just hearing words and if I was to explain to someone this man's experience, I would just be repeating his words without understanding how that feels and I would kind of logically know it sucks and i would act accordingly so say like ""it must suck to live that way""

I CAN understand by consciously using effort to ""live a moment"" like that in my head and trying to imagine what that feels like. But it requires effort. Is this smthn u have as well? Also if someone explained smthn terrible to me like their dog died or mom or smthn, I would only hear the words and ""know"" to say oh im sorry etc. But then if i really consciously imagine and use effort, I can give more of an emotional reaponse with empathy etc. So it takes extra effort. Idk if for ppl it's automatic to have empathy based on someone's words. Thoughts?",1

"Rejected because ASD isn't diversity Has anyone else ever experienced being rejected because of your Autism?

Specifically, I'm talking about jobs, careers, or artistic endeavours.

For instance, I run an improv / sketch comedy troupe with other autistic people. I recently applied to be part of an improv festival this coming summer. 

I reached out to this organization during COVID while they weren't even operating.
They open back up this year. They emailed me over a year ago telling me they'd let me know when they were going to start up again. 

Fast forward... The day they posted the event they also emailed me. I paid the fees to apply to be part of the festival and submitted the application the same day. 

I got a message a couple weeks ago that they had rejected us. They claimed that diversity is important to them and they want to represent underrepresented groups. 

I responded (partly out of emotion) that we've been a largely female group (most of our cast is female), and we're all Neurodiverse. 

The didn't care.
I've experienced the same thing with job opportunities. 
Many NTs don't include us in their vision of inclusivity, despite being severely underrepresented. 

They expect to see a wheelchair, physical disability, or some other physically visible trait. 

It's frustrating and heartbreaking having to explain ourselves to ""normal"" people all the time.",1

"Adult in a child's body, but then a child in adult's body When I was a kid, I was told I act older and more mature than my peers, I had more ""adult"" viewpoints on life, I loved talking to people older than me like my teachers, etc. But now that I'm an adult, I do everything opposite: I'm told I have a childish outlook on the world, I enjoy everything that's labeled ""for kids"" (playgrounds, toys, children's books and tv shows...), and while I don't necessarily like little kids, I'd rather talk with them than my peers. 

My entire life I act ""the wrong age"". I feel like my brain and my body aren't really cooperating. Besides what I mentioned, I'm also more child-like when it comes to my physical being and experiences. Everyone around me has already had their first relationships, formed friendship groups, went on vacation with their friends, started building their life... while I feel like that time still hasn't come for me, like I'm not ""old enough"" for that yet (I'm turning 20 this year). My family thinks I'm very weird and that there must be something wrong with me. They tell me I'm like a grumpy grandma and that there's no youth in me, but I feel the opposite?

Another thing that adds to my child-like personality is discomfort with my physical body. Everyone physically develops by the time they leave their teens, they become comfortable with their sexuality, sex (as in what's between your legs), everything sexual in general, while I'm still squeamish about it and very uncomfortable with such topics (if they're ""about"" me). I'm also not particularly interested in my gender. I know I'm biologically a girl, but that's all. To me that's just a fact, nothing more. I could care less if someone refers to me as a boy, he, she, they, it just doesn't matter to me, like my brain can't process that there's a difference between those things.

Could these things have something to do with autism? Does anybody else feel like this? I haven't been diagnosed yet, I'm searching for good doctors right now, but I would love to know if these things could have more meaning.",1
"Overreading Social Cues So I basically discovered that I have asperger's and it explains a lot of things about myself. But one thing which I found very interesting is that for most people with Asperger's, they lack the ability to read social cues. When I was younger I was like that but I've noticed that the opposite has happened now; I read social cues a lot, usually being able to tell people's emotions or certain facts/traits about them just from small things they say or how they act, even a lot more than neurotypical people. That being said, I've also noticed that sometimes I read so much that I make grand conclusions/assumptions about people that are often not true or are a lot simpler than I make out to be. Has anyone else had this trait and is it still an asperger's thing or is it a general trait of those on the autism spectrum?",1
"input from others who had a similar experience would be greatly appreciated. Hey guys, I have a bit of a weird problem and I am unsure what is happening. I will say I am not fully up to date on how Asperger's/asd affects me but I'll just get into it.

I recently broke up with my ex two weeks ago. I was very unhappy in the relationship and it felt like the right time to do it. Since then I have been going through a bit of an upset mentally. I think it's stress? But I am not feeling more stressed than usual if that makes sense. I have been having a bout of insomnia, a few panic attacks, pains in my chest, eczema all over the back of my hands, general mental instability.

I have noticed some of my aspie traits flaring up too, such as having a harder time than normal when reading people and feeling like the don't like me. 

I'll have a good day and then the next day I'm down, it's been like that since I broke up. I moved into a new place on the day too. It's been a lot of big changes recently. I thought I would be fine with it all but I can't help feeling that it's affecting me.

I am happy that I am out of the relationship, for instance I have stopped picking my skin and got back into exercise.

I know there are some out there who struggle to know how they feel, I am unsure if that's an accurate depiction of the problem/condition. I used to be ok at it but for the last two weeks I feel almost disconnected with myself.

I will get over it over time, it's just been a bit hard. If anyone has any inputs or advice I am all ears.",1
"Something weird and funny happened to me because of my ASD For context: I like trains. 

I was waiting for the bus and sat down on a bench near the bus stop. I was texting with my boyfriend and he asked me if I wanted to visit the apartment we like (we're moving) and suggested to go there by TRAIN. I got so excited I jumped up and paced right up to the bus stop only to realize there's no bus coming. I just got too excited too suddenly that I couldn't contain myself and my brain turned on the autopilot and loaded some kind of reaction that's roughly appropriate. Then I walked back to the bench and sat down again and told my BF what I'd just done. I think we both had a good laugh.",1

"One reason why the English language is bad for Aspies Maybe you've been in this scenario. Someone asks you ""Please get the 6 inch, red, Craftsman Phillips-head screwdriver."" That's a noun with 4 adjectives on it, but what's worse is that you don't even know they're asking of you until you get to the noun, which is at the end of the sentence! This is the way how English is, we put our adjectives before our nouns. In other languages they do it differently. In Hebrew for instance they'd say ""Please get the screwdriver 6 inch, red, Craftsman, Phillips-head."" They tell you what it is you should be looking for, & then specify it. Meanwhile in English, you're just trying to hold on to all these adjectives in your head until they finally get around to the noun so you know what the heck they want. 

This means that in instances like this the English language isn't a good fit for people with poor Working Memory scores, which is common for people on the spectrum. You can tell if you have a poor working memory by taking the WAIS-IV, and you take the WAIS-IV by going to your state government's Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, where I got mine taken for free.",1
"I hate that I always fuck up every chance at having a friend/partner I've always been lonely. I think that because of my autism, I just don't care about anything that is not my hyperfixation. In fact, I think that's the only reason I'm still alive.


Also because of my autism, I just don't know how to behave. I always act very weird and like a creep (people have confirmed it). It's just a matter of time until people see that I am way too obsessed over something or that I said something mean without realizing it, and they stop talking to me. I just think a relationship without common interests is doomed to fail.


So, a couple of weeks ago, I met another autistic girl at therapy, and we met. I thought I had found ""the one"". We texted each other everyday and I think we both got our expectations a little too high. It was just a matter of time until that bubble exploded. I just didn't know how to talk about her interests. I don't share them. 


We also ended up debating about politics and that didn't turn out well. She barely sees my texts now, and I don't blame her. I really feel guilty as fuck, but I think I damaged the relationship permanently. 

Does anyone else experience the same? I feel like I'm doomed to die alone now. It is just way too hard to find anyone with my niche interests, and I have no real life job. It's impossible for me to meet people in real life.",1
"How do you guys make friends online? Please excuse the ridiculous question, but I’m ready to branch out a bit. I’m WFH and an online student, and my girlfriend is halfway around the world on a semester abroad, thus I spent the vast majority of my time alone with my cat. I don’t mind being alone whatsoever, but I find myself wishing I had more people to converse with about which I’m passionate. I just don’t really know where to begin.

I love gaming, and I spend roughly 12 hours a day online in some form or another. It seems the obvious choice, but after being alone for a while, I’ve felt many of my social skills rust at a minimum, if not completely disappear. I’ve been playing mostly single-player games, but I’d happily take suggestions. I think I’d enjoy having a buddy to game with. 

I suppose I don’t really know where to look, and I need to find a good way to initiate. Does anyone have some advice?",1
"What does autism feel like in social settings? I am considering whether I might be autistic. 
I have a constant terror of saying something that for some reason is considered ""weird"".

I am not myself with others as I feel my spontaneous self would be misinterpreted. I have noticed recently that probably my face would not be very expressive if I did not subconsciously prompt myself to express myself on that level.

I am also terrified of saying things ""the wrong way"", like with a weird phrasing, which I think I do quite often.

I hate faking and not saying things directly, but I feel like I have no choice but ""translate"" my direct sentences into embellished indirect ones otherwise people would get offended (this has not happened though. Is it because I fake well?)

On the other hand, I am very good at reading people, and I can read through the lines quite easily although I would love a world where I can take people's statements at face value. 

I am also gifted and traumatized from abuse and bullying. But I feel like there might be more because my panic with social norms and appearing wrong /weird is just...extreme.

It's like I am quite aware of social norms I just hate following them and I have to suppress my whole being to do that.

"Anyone struggle caring for others’ interests/hobbies? So I’ve recently started therapy and found out a few things about myself. One being that I absolutely have no investment in others hobbies or interests. For example, I could talk about my favourite movie or song to someone, then when they respond with a movie they like that I’ve never heard or a song I haven’t listened to, I will then lie and pretend I’ve seen said movie or heard said song so they stop talking about it.

"not sure what to do at this point in my life 
Hi. This is going to be a long read, so I understand if no one wants to read it. I just need to talk about everything.

I am not diagnosed. I know that here, self diagnosis is accepted, but I still feel awful feeling this way without a proper diagnosis. I have heard it is very difficult to be diagnosed due to issues with actually speaking to a professional, and how sometimes autism gets dismissed for something else, or just ignored. I have an autistic friend who swears that I am, and she has known me since I was a young teen, now almost 20yo. She got me to take the assessments she took, and she is formally diagnosed, and I scored above the maximum requirement for each assessment. Its just the fact Ive been dismissed as being “stubborn” or “misbehaved” my whole life, like I have been gaslit this whole time, that I don’t know what to do or what to think. I’ve never been a bad kid, I was a straight A student, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t struggle to keep up my entire life, especially socially.

I have severe social anxiety, separation anxiety, and sensory issues. I cannot talk on the phone, I cannot keep a job, I cannot order for myself at restaurants, I can’t even make an appointment for myself if I needed to. If I had to call 911 if I was in a dangerous situation, I don’t know if I could. I can’t even handle speaking in person to my own family, it is so hard for me. I get sweaty and nervous just sending a simple text to anyone. I don’t go anywhere alone. I barely even go to the bathroom by myself. I never shower by myself, I don’t sleep by myself, I won’t eat unless someone else is eating, etc. I try to sleep while my boyfriend is at work so that I am not trapped in my own mind. 

Sensory issues are another major issue I have. I change clothes multiple times a day, especially socks. I will not touch my floor without socks. I can’t stand wearing my hair certain ways or even tucking it behind my ear frustrates me. I can’t stand loud noises. I cover my ears around trains or speakers. I keep vibrations and sound haptics disabled on my phone because they scare me. I don’t like flashing lights and certain colors make my head hurt. I constantly twist and pop my ankles/wrists so much that it hurts, but I can’t help it. I don’t like touching people and I don’t like them touching me, I always refuse hugs and handshakes, and people just think I am mean, but I just can’t do it. I only wear the same old clothing as I always do because anything new or uncomfortable frustrates me. I can’t handle heat. Being slightly sweaty makes me want to just sit in the shower in cry.

Currently, I want a diagnosis. The problem with this, is that I can’t do it myself, and I am too afraid to even tell my parents how I feel about this. They are close minded, and I know if I told them how I thought I was autistic, that I would be met with blank stares and would be gaslit like I always have been. I want their help, but I can’t even talk to them. They won’t accept it. They would tell me I am too smart for what I am saying to be true.. but, thats not how it works at all. They don’t even believe that I have allergies when I told them.

I am happy to have my current S/O, they help me get through a lot of these things and they are acceptant of my self diagnosis, and they encourage me to just be myself. But am I the only one who desires a real diagnosis? I know something is wrong. I can’t even take care of myself. I could quite literally not be independent and fend for myself it I needed to.

The last thing I am confused about is why? Why didn’t my parents think anything was abnormal? I walk on my tip toes. I have clear issues with how materials felt. I didn’t have friends. I clearly have an eating disorder, and I even verbally told them this. Why did they dismiss all of it? And could this be why I am so doubtful of myself? 

I don’t know. Thanks to anyone who actually read all of this. There is so much more I actually want to say. I don’t know what to do at this point in my life. The way I live my day to day life is a struggle and it hinders me from being a person, or at least that is how I feel.

edit: i left out a whole part of why i feel this way, mainly my anxiety. i am SO confused when I try to talk to people. i feel like anytime i talk that the things i say get taken out of context and people get offended or whatever because they think im being rude, when there was no hidden meanings behind what i said.

i dont get jokes. i cant tell when someone is being sarcastic, and this usually results into me apologizing for not understanding and just being quiet. i feel like i have to walk on eggshells when i talk in fear of upsetting someone and i always recite the things i say in my head before the conversation actually happens, in fear of messing up. its just simply because i don’t understand what people are thinking or what they are thinking when they look at me a certain way. i cant seem to understand how they feel about things and i cant express to them how i feel about something either.",1

"I find myself socially irritable and not sure where to go with this I think having hypervigilance and social issues has caught up to me in a way where I don't like being around people very much.

I think maybe I just need to do more of these and overtime I'll get used to it again? There were times when I was younger where I had a lot of friends. Maybe after a handful of annoying experiences, I'll grow to like it again? What do you think?",1
"Will my mom always love me? I have been going to therapy and learned a lot of my self-esteem issues derive from the interactions with my mom when I was living at home. Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post to either.

When I was 10, I told my cousin that my brothers didn’t like her mother. My cousin got upset and my mom then told me every day for months that I did a horrible thing and we couldn’t see our cousins ever again because of what I said. I didn’t think I did anything wrong at the time.

When I was 15, I won my first wrestling match. I told my mom and she asked “was your opponent actually trying?”

Whenever I started new jobs and she asked how it was going and I said I was doing well she would ask “in real life?”

My therapist recommended I discuss with my mom how some of what she did affected my self esteem but I’m really nervous to discuss it with my mom.

I’m scared my mom will get mad at me and not want anything to do with me.

"I Delt with a Tricky Situation Successfully! **Short Story;**

I went to get something through ""Click & Collect"" and it went poorly. I still managed to get the whole thing done!

**Full Story;**

I made my way up after getting the notification that my products were ready. This was an odd start with getting three separate emails and messages for the individual products and not the whole order but that is not as much an issue as the rest. I clicked on the ""I'm on my way"" option on each email and went ahead to go to the store. It was prompt preparing everything to that point which was nice to see.

I made my way to the Click & Collect parking at the Tallaght store and opened the emails and clicked ""I'm here"" and requested the delivery to car option at around 11:00. I put in my mobile number and car registration as requested, the additional details were not needed as I was the only person in those spots. After waiting around a half an hour, I figured I made a mistake and was meant to leave the page open on one product that said I would be dealt with shortly. ""My mistake"", I thought, I had not used this before so that is ok. Having one email only would have made it more clear though.

Unfortunately, it got to the one hour mark waiting. I was confused to say the least so was debating heading into the store but there were a few issues:

* What if I miss the person bringing the items out and then the order is cancelled.
* I had not prepared myself to go in the store.
* What if I made a mistake in the process and now I'll be interfering with things.
* I'll probably annoy the staff and they don't need more work.

To me, this was a rather large predicament I found myself in, but I decided I would go in the store because I must have made a mistake in how the process worked.

I went back to the email and chose to collect in store and followed the instructions to go to the collection desk. There was, however, a queue. This is not something they can really control on who is there, so it was ok. I waited in the line for some time but the customers at the desk were rather argumentative so it was clear it would take some time. A member of the floor staff did come over to check on everyone in the line to see if he was able to help and although he was not able to help anyone at this time I was still appreciative that he came to check on us all.

Some more time was spent in the queue and a member of the staff came out from behind the desk to see if anyone can be helped more quickly. He informed me that I can get my order by talking to ""that man"" who he pointed out. I thanked the man and went over to the other staff member.

He did seem busy though but that was who I was told to talk to. I did manage to get his attention, but he seemed rather bothered by the interaction and just told me to go “over there” to the TV section to “him”. Now, this staff member did seem busy or in a rush, but he was rather abrupt and not as polite as the other two staff.

By now, I was beginning to feel sick and shaky because I was getting incredibly stressed by the whole situation, but I made my way over to the other staff member. He was dealing with a customer, so I waited. After some time, he did come over to check on me, I am not sure if he was done with the other customer or had some time, either way I was glad he took the time to help.

He asked me how he could help, and I gave the order number, and he told me to go out and take two right turns and they can help you. This man was genuinely nice and helpful, but it did little to ease the stress at this point.

So, I made my way to the car and had to sit there for a bit to gather myself together and settle down. I had debated calling my mam to essentially help ease my mind and the situation but she was out to the cinema for a day out, so I did not want to ruin her day.

I made my way over to the collection place suggested by the staff member in the store and the two ladies that were there were exceptionally kind and helpful so that was helpful in easing my mind.

Still, I got what I ordered and made it back home. Not going to lie though, it had me rather unsettled for some time as I settled my mind.

There was a driver too on the way up that was not helpful for setting the stage for this whole situation.",1

"Dealing with anxiety around doing something wrong Prefacing this with the disclaimer that I am seeing a therapist about this, but I was just curious if anyone else experiences something similar and knows a way to deal with it.

I deal with a lot of anxiety around doing something wrong unintentionally. It tends to become a major problem when someone I’m close to changes their behavior in some way.  For example, if a roommate starts to avoid common areas and doesn’t respond the same way they normally do when I try to talk to them, I become TOTALLY convinced that they hate me. I’ll start to isolate myself and avoid the person because I think they don’t want to be around me.

This becomes a huge issue when I do actually do something wrong. Because I get SO worked up about the possibility, I tend to have an emotional reaction if they do actually bring up an issue. It’s really embarrassing. I just want to have a normal conversation where I take responsibility and apologize, but I just start crying in the middle of the conversation. (This only happens if I’m already anxious, if the person brings it up when I’m calm it’s totally fine and I can be mature about it lol) This makes the person uncomfortable, and they stop telling me when I do something wrong because of it.

I don’t know how to stop this from happening. I’m really struggling to use normal anxiety-based coping skills because often it IS fact-based and they ARE actually upset for some reason. I would really appreciate any advice on this if you experience something similar.",1

I don’t know. Sorry, I guess I’m just publicly venting.",1
"Do anyone of you feel like you grew up improperly due Asperger’s/autism? Looking at things through hindsight and seeing how I compare to others of my age…I’ve aged terribly and with some awkward aspects basically feel like I’m a guy of his generation who’s lost in time.
I wear basic clothes(far too often a black t-shirt and jeans), I don’t do my hair that great(it’s a sh***y improvised fohawkish hair thing that only raises the front hairs and it looks bad,especially when I have apparently an oversized forehead, but it’s stuck up because I look really ugly and have no other hair alternatives). Though Asperger’s or not there’s one factor that makes it hard for me fit in and look normal and that is since my teens my face turned weird and looks especially ugly, dirty, and in recent days creepy(even when I wear a mask just my eyes alone look weird). I tried everything look like cleansin my face 24/7 and being out in the sun and still nothing. i can't even wear hats or hoods without looking strange in them.
I feel weak and awkward when I’m walking in public compared to my non-autistic brother in where my hands want to fidget and I can’t put my hands in my pockets for warmth without it looking weird.
Even my voice sounds nasally and weak that it makes it discouraging to speak up cause it too sounds weird.
And I often have a hard time what adults of my generation do these days in getting caught up(shows,memes, hanging out). I was a bit more used to being a kid than an adult. Autism really disrupts the growing up process which is serious. And my parents have been too clueless(like no wonder I have autism..sorry I just had frustrating times with them lately. They don’t try to listen to the rules and facts they’re people who improvise and fantasize over things) to help, I’m on my own to realize the better.
I also would regret not doing varsity soccer or any sports even if I already look weird to supposedly better stimulate growth of my body with playful outside exercising. I’m now really thinking of just how many of my peers did stuff like that too.",1
"I get extremely stressed when asked if I want to do something. I need time to digest it and I also need to know all the details. How can this be described to someone simply? I suppose the title is simple enough but I know there’s terms for things or further literature. I don’t know what you would call this issue? I need help explaining this to someone. 

This happens to me a lot. I’m asked if I want to do something. The truth is I never want to do *anything* but once I digest the idea of an activity I sometimes would like to do it. Only if it’s family, if not it might not be something I’d want to do. I feel like this is not understood about me and I tried saying “I will get back to you” but then I made it worse by saying the truth. The truth that I don’t want to do anything and that I can’t decide how I’ll feel about x, y, z since it’s so far away. Then the idea is scrapped and it makes me feel bad. The bottom line is I just need time to process it but it never happens this way. 

I notice a lot of the time I get immediately anxious and it just never goes right. I get anxious and I get agitated and I get annoyed when I’m asked if I want to do something out of the ordinary. But it also depends on what it is. Some things are in the realm of stuff that is not out of the ordinary for me to be asked. My issue is when I’m asked if I want to do something that is so out of the ordinary, like if I want to go on a trip or an outing that has never been broached in the past. 

Is there any literature about this? I’ve read this many times but I’m having trouble finding a good article. I don’t know if this is just about decision making. I just feel like I need to understand it a little better for me to explain it better because this sort of thing comes up in my life maybe once a year maybe twice.",1

"Questions to aspies from a potential aspie Hello. Tomorrow, I'm actually going to the doctor for a referral to someone who can test me for asperger's, or, autism spectrum disorder, as it's called in my country. I know that it's looked down-upon to claim to be autistic without a diagnosis, and rightfully-so, so before I ask some questions, I want to clarify that I could very well not have asperger's. However, since my mother first suggested I get tested, I've been reading about this and it's really interested me, so I have some questions.

\-**Do you guys tend to actually struggle with anger and being too assertive?** Most aspies I've seen in media are either portrayed as completely-withdrawn or very people-pleasing and socially-awkward. Personally, I am definitely very introverted, aloof and have what others call ""a resting bitch face,"" but I rarely struggle with shyness. I am very stubborn on doing what makes sense to me and value honesty, even if it hurts. Part of why my mother's getting me tested is because the combination of me being socially-oblivious, caring little of what others think, and being very stubborn, has actually turned me into something of a problem child (of course I'd manage to accomplish that without even boys or partying...).

I try to compensate for my social-awkwardness by actually being loud. If I'm talkative and blunt and make edgy jokes, then people tend to think I'm funny. When I was a kid, I become loud, obnoxious, and ""lUl RaNdOm,"" the class clown, because if I couldn't get people laughing with me, at least people could laugh at me, and they'd still want to stick around. To this day, when people laugh, I immediately get a huge dopamine boost, even if they're not really laughing for a good reason. And so, when I'm not drooling and staring off into the clouds, I argue, I intimidate, I laugh, and at least when people stare at me in shock, it was out of something intentional. I am in control of it (and I can get my inner nerd out and go ""AKSHULLY"" on Reddit).

Ok, that was a novel, sorry. My question is, have some of you guys compensated for your social struggles by becoming more assertive?

\-it seems to be a common sentiment among asperger's communities, that when you're a child you feel like an adult, and when you're an adult you feel like a child. I relate to this immensely. **I was wondering, though, if you guys can pinpoint the age at which you started feeling more like a kid than an adult?** For me, I think it happened at age twelve. It's strange, because my beliefs were very different when I was twelve, but I think it was at that age that my preferred thinking process really solidified. I dunno. Either way, I feel like twelve-year-old me in my sixteen-year-old body, just, even more tired.

**-do you guys tend to think you're pretty okay at socializing in the present moment, but then you look back on your past and always seem to say ""wow, I was pretty awkward for my age?""** Because of my aforementioned compensation of feigning extroversion, I used to think I was more socially-skilled than others, just because I talked more and others took my bluntness for humor. Also, it's generally just hard for me to tell when I screw up, socially. Only a few months ago, it genuinely did not occur to me that I should not say that my friend looks like a rat - only recently did I remember that and desperately apologize to her. And it's the same thing every time I look back - just layers of shit that should have been obviously-taboo but that I didn't get. What's even scarier, is that I'm probably just scratching the surface of my ineptitude.

**Also, do you guys have any tips for how I can notice my social mishaps in the present moment?** On one hand, I want to be better, but on the other hand, I don't want to become a stuttering wimp. I've been wondering how I can learn to better-intuit what's socially-acceptable, because experience is one long degree to earn. I've tried reading books on socialization, manipulation, body language, the works, but when I actually try to put any methods into practice, it's all too much for me to process.

\-**do you guys know if it's possible to ""select"" special interests?** I swear to God I only obsess over the stupidest shit. It's often fandoms - I become invested in one, spend 50% of my time obsessively daydreaming stories about it, repeat for months or years, run out of story material, then move on to the next interesting story. Or, I randomly become infatuated with something dumb, like tsunamis, and follow that interest to the ends of the Earth. When I was a kid, I used to info-dump constantly about tsunamis, my favorite book series, and nutritionism. I feel so bad for the polite adults I yapped to for hours on end. As I got older, I've generally learned to not talk about what I'm interested in. Nowadays, I prattle on about gossip and politics like everyone around me.

Anyways, it would definitely be useful if I could control what I have a special interest in. I know this may be a stretch, but if there are any methods or theories, I'd love to hear them.

\-**how do you guys prevent meltdown?** I rarely experience this, but think I may have experienced this recently, at a show. Long story short, it was obnoxiously-loud - even when I plugged my ears, it felt like shrieking in my ear, but everyone around me cheered and had a good time.

It became too much, I started crying and shaking uncontrollably. I begged my mother to let me leave, but she made me stay because she says I need to become accostomed to these situations. Honestly, it was one of the worst experiences of my life.

It's not just these extreme things either - I get overwhelmed so easily. When I inconvenience people, when too many people demand things from me at once, when I have to see PDA, when I have to listen to music I don't like, people slurping soup, high-pitched laughter, dogs whining... sometimes, I burst into tears for what looks to others like no reason. I feel stupid for being so sensitive.

Sometimes, it helps for me to repeat a prayer over and over and over or scream into a pillow, but it draws attention, so I can't usually do that. I try my best to do deep breathing, stare at something, clear my head - hell, I once did that for a whole hour and the anger and overwhelm would rush back no matter what. But I can't always run away from these situations and I feel so helpless. That specific time, I was staring out the window and avoiding eye-contact with others so that they wouldn't see my emotional state. My mother took it as defiance and got angry at me. No one around me seems to understand how horrible it feels. I want to find ways to stop feeling like that, or stop getting overwhelmed in the first place.

I have more questions, but I have just realized that my nonesense rivals Kant's, so I think I'll leave at this. Thanks to anyone who bothers to read, let alone answer, this drivel.",1
"Any advice for helping my ASD son get a blood test done? I've now tried three times at three separate pathology labs to get a blood test my paediatrician ordered almost a year ago now for my 9 year old ASD son. We spent almost 2 hours at the lab today and he came through and sat in the chair four times but he freaked out and started crying and trying to run away each time and of course I'm not going to physically force him to do anything. I couldn't do it anymore so we left after the fourth try. My husband tried the first time and couldn't even get him to go inside the lab. I tried the second time and he bit me so hard I bled (he's not bitten me since he was a toddler).  
  
He's a great, well adjusted little guy I love to bits, but he fixates on his fear of the pain and can't distract himself or use any coping mechanisms we've tried in therapy once he gets into that fearful thought loop. Crazy thing is he's had blood tests before and not had any issues, but he did find getting the COVID vaccines hard so I think it's fear from that experience.  
  
Things we've tried/considered:.  
- watching me go first/talking him through what's happening - he finds this more stressful, he doesn't want to think about what is going to happen.  
- emla patches (numbing medication) - he had those on today and it didn't help with his fear at all despite the phlebotomist showing him his skin was numb multiple times. He is (very reasonably) scared it will hurt one the needle penetrates his numb skin.  
- bring his iPad/current novel he's reading in with him - he can't focus on it enough to get distract him.  
- rewards - he is usually very rewards driven, but this is too big an emotional reaction to see this pay-off logically a worth the fear and possible pain.  
- taking breaks to distract and calm down - obviously this works to help emotionally regulate after each try, but didn't seem to help get him to a different mindset to have a more successful attempt.  
   
Of course having an older woman in the waiting area ask ""is he done or did he walk out?"" after an attempt then come up and show him her band-aid and say ""see, I did it, it's easy"" is sooo helpful too. The staff today were wonderful and we'll try again there, but I really need some thoughts or ideas from people with experience in this situation. It's frustrating not knowing if there's something else (like a vitamin deficiency) going on we could help with and mortifying going to each paediatrician appointment and being asked about if we've done the test and having to say no. Thoughts?  
  
Edit: forgot to add this is a fasting blood test, which of course doesn't help with his resilience as the longer we are there the hungrier more poor little guy gets 😥",1

"Traditional psychotherapy may be may be contra-indicated during autistic burnout Interesting study on the need for treatment to support people in autistic burnout. The research was centered on autistic adult voices/experience.

Of note, it suggests traditional therapy methods (CBT etc.) may do more harm than good for someone in autistic burnout. This aligns with my personal experience.

I had a severe burnout episode 2 years ago with persistent unaliving ideation and I was scared to death. Me, my husband, and my best friend searched EVERYWHERE for professional support/treatment to help me. We had just learned I’m autistic, and we were stunned that the only option available for immediate, intensive treatment was to call 911 and get checked into a regular inpatient facility (a sensory nightmare which would have further exacerbated my condition).

I’m glad there’s finally something in the literature about the need for appropriate support. I feel validated in my decision to fire my psychiatrist and opt-out of any further psychotherapy.

“Our results highlight that routine treatments for depression, such as cognitive behaviour therapy and behavioural activation, may be contra-indicated within autistic burnout, even though these conditions may co-exist. Our experts described the need for withdrawal and downtime for recovery, somewhat antithetic to behavioural activation. With cognitive overload being described as a key precursor of autistic burnout, cognitive-focused therapies could be counterproductive.”

Kawhi Leonard Might Be Autistic🧐 ,1
"""Uncanny Valley"" Hello.

I never felt the ""creeps"" from things that people seem to be disturbed, like clowns, ""realistic"" cartoons, dolls, mannequins or anything that ""looks human"" but it isn't.

I started to think this was linked to autism because of some traits associated with difficulties understanding facial expressions, so, I don't have a parameter of how a human face should or shouldn't act that I can recognize immediately.

When I said I wasn't scared of those things, schoolmates and family just said I was being an edgy teenager, so I started acting scared even if I wasn't at all, just to be accepted, a.k.a. masking.

Has anyone had a similar experience as this? It could possibly be a link between not being scared about those things and autism? What do you think?",1

I was rather recently diagnosed with both autism and ADHD...  It feels really hard to do simple things. It can feel like I have opposite sides/traits that make it difficult to sound/appear coherent. I have topics I can spend lots and lots of time talking about, but then I lose interest in things pretty easily. It's rather hard to keep track of a thought or idea because I have so many different ones competing for a spotlight in my mind. It feels too noisy in my mind. Luckily, in a way, it's not as severe as before because I'm now taking Concerta to help with my ADHD, but still...

Also, I feel like sometimes I get easily over stimulated, but other times, I kinda crave some kind of ""action"" to ""feel"" something like: moving my fingers in a sequenced way or even making some sounds. One of the worst things I feel is that I ""need""/often find myself using a ""mask"" during most social interactions that I need to go through daily. It's a defensive mechanism that is a double-edged sword: on one side, it helps me ""survive"" and do things, but on the other side, it drains my energy so aggressively. It's such a fine line that often can't be maintained.

I've also been taking sertraline and I've been feeling more ""free"" and am starting to gain confidence to truly be myself and not spend so much energy hiding who I am in fact. But at the same time, I question myself: Is it okay for me to *truly* be myself like that? I mean, all of my life I learned through unfortunate ways to hide and ""behave"" and now that I'm feeling better, some may think I'm not like this and I'm just craving for attention etc..

"Is it worth it to disclose to an employer after 2 years? I've worked at a place for 2 years now.
After a few months I got promoted to a supervisor position that involved a lot of paperwork, reports, and managing.

I really struggle with executive functioning, organizational skills, but I was up for the challenge.

It was way too much for me though, and I was fired after a few months.

They've since taken me back doing my original position, and things are going well.

I've never disclosed my Aspergers diagnosis to an employer before, and wish I had so they might have known I struggle with executive functioning skills...but I didn't want to be held back by any possibilities either.

Do you think it's worth it disclose this even a couple years into a job?

What have been your positive or negative experiences with disclosing to an employer?",1
"Do you have 2 levels of consciousness? I have, I don't want to say two personalities, but more two levels of consciousness. How can I explain that? 
Let's assume I'm driving a car and there is another person near me that have already setted my way on Google Maps. 

So I'm going that way, anyway. 

For example, when I was 5 years old I decided to becoming a bank employee. And now, I'm studying for that even if in the years I changed my mind various times. 

I can, somewhat, feel this subconscious personality. 

I know that I'm not the dominant one of this body, I know I'm just a mask. 

I know she is the true me. 
She is somewhat free from bonds, empathy, maternal instinct, pain, happiness, depression. 

I'm like the emotional part of myself, but I'm way younger than her. 

I don't know how to explain that.",1

"Are there any polyamorous people here who feel like being poly is, for them, linked to being autistic? I've been questioning a lot about whether I might be poly but I'm not sure if it's because I'm autistic or because if trauma I've experienced because of it has made me feel like I just can't have the kind of relationship I want with just one person. I just feel like monogamy is so limiting as far as the kinds of relationships I can have and it seems statistically impossible to find someone right for me. I have a lot of special interests and sharing them is really important to me in a relationship and statistically the likelihood of finding someone who finds me attractive, meshes with my personality, and shares my interests seems pretty much impossible. Especially given the fact that I live in a relatively small town. It also seems ludicrous to me to give up being with someone awesome who you love just because they don't meet all your needs but also equally crazy to live my whole life not having a partner to share certain things with. Anyway, just wondered if anyone else feels similarly because I've been thinking about it a lot and feeling kind of ashamed for feeling this way.",1

I don't know what it feels like not to be ""like me"", I thought everyone was meant to be like me. I was told a friend ""I will like to date someone like me"", and she said ""urrrmm,Nope! its not happening because there is nobody like you""…….I am generally described as innocent and sweet.

I took many diagnostics texts online and all the results showed that I have a strong likelihood of autism. Is there any Psychological firm/clinic online that  I can check into for a diagnosis?

"BDSM and neurodivergence Hi! I've been thinking a bit about the intersection of BDSM and nerurodivergence.

until it's too much for the other person and they leave (this has happened a couple of times now). 
i'm convinced i'll never be able to be a ""good"" friend and even people i'm not as close to have told me i need to become more empathetic (this is a weekly occurrence at this point). 

""I don't know if you just ignore how other people feel about things
or if you actually have no idea how i feel."" that was something an old fried said to me. 

i hurt every single person i'm around and i don't even know i'm doing it. i say things i shouldn't i do things i shouldn't i don't how to comfort other people i don't notice when somebody feels hurt. 

I need clear and direct communication, otherwise is just don't notice anything. I believe i have a really bad sense of empathy and i also can't really feel/see stuff from other people's perspective. When someone is noticeably sad or directly says so i know i should feel something but i just don't?? i just feel incredibly awkward because i don't know what to do which in turn makes me feel bad about myself. 

I took an empathy quotient test just out of interest (i know it's just a silly online test) and got a 10 (out of 80 max; 30 is the threshold score) 

However i can empathise with fictional characters, not just any, but i am able to and I have read a few books that made me cry. But i think books make it easier to empathise because you're kinda told what the character is feeling?? 

Right now i have zero close friends which i kinda sad because I want to have friends!! And i'm  trying to become a better person but i feels impossible!!! 
Not to mention that it's also incredibly hard for me to find people that like me, in general.

The only thing that does satisfy me is watching genuine happiness from genuine people because it feels like a good general direction in life.

It’s literally dog shit.

"Can't Stop Resenting My Colleague TLDR AT THE BOTTOM

So, time for a mini rant because I've been holding this in for too long and if I were to do this anywhere else I'd be called an incel by neurotypicals who can't empathize with me.

I (23M) will be 24 in a month and although I'm in a master's program and thinking of doing a PhD, I think these goals will never make up for all of the social and romantic failures in my life caused by my autism. 

To give you context: I was bullied/excluded/rejected/shit on by most people my age growing up even until I was 21 for being too ""different"" from them and never given the chance to integrate with others/ work on the bs ""social skills"" that they covet so much.

Fast forward to today, I may have friends but no true friend group, and even then, a lot of my friends (I don't even know if they're worth that title) are often too ""busy"" to hangout with me. Not to mention the fact that I've employed literally every strategy that others have told me to do such as joining clubs, meetups, dating apps, asking social people for introductions etc yet none of this has worked out for me in helping me get the life I want for myself.

Literally everyone else in my cohort and honestly age bracket has a long-term relationship/is getting married, along with other goals that they inevitably will meet. But even more pertinent to what's been going on, I have this colleague in my cohort who I haven't been able to stop resenting and hating, in particular.

Why do I resent my colleague? Well, here are a few reasons:

1. She's neurotypical (naturally)
2. She's attractive
3. She has a proper social circle, unlike me
4. She's been in a long term relationship since she and her partner were 15.

Basically, she is everything I never got to be in my life, and in a few years time she'll probably be getting married whilst I'll still be single and it'll be too late for me to have any kind of meaningful relationship/married unlike her and the rest of my cohort.

Although she claims she was bullied like I was in school, it probably wasn't as bad as the bullying and negative reinforcement I had to go through in my own life because unlike me, the bullying she went through didn't ruin her life like it did mine. 

And before any of you ask, yes I am in therapy and have been for 8.5 years (currently on my 11th therapist) but none of this stuff has worked out for me. If anything, the ""therapy"" has actually made me even more angry and resentful of everyone around me, especially my colleague. 

This resentment for my colleague has been eating me alive for the past 5 months and I never have truly felt as powerless and hopeless as I have been in my entire life.

TLDR: Colleague has the life I want because she never suffered like I did and I can't stop resenting her for it.",1

Does anybody else get super depressed/stressed or over whelmed the first two days after a full moon? But feel great before and during?

Also I noticed the last few months the stock market did well right before the full moon and was red the couple days after haha. They should have a track the moon trading algorithm to see if there’s any correlation. Even if it’s coincidental. The moon is very fascinating. Fish behavior revolves around the moon and tide and I’m pretty sure our ancestors used to hunt under the light of a full moon.,1
"Does autism make you physically tired? I am asking because I have several other diagnoses and sometimes it is hard to know what is what. The past year I have felt so weak physically. My energy is gone. I have never been very strong or energic, but not this kind of weak either.

"My family is making me feel miserable and I can’t move out I can’t stand being around my family anymore. I’m the only aspie in my family so there’s no one I can really talk to. My mom is the only one who at least somewhat tries to understand me, but she sometimes says and does things that make me question whether she really cares about me. My dad is also nice to me, but I never have any conversations with him that go deeper than small talk. The rest of my family hates me for having Aspergers (which they have said out loud multiple times). They always say how much of a burden I am and that they enjoy it when I’m not around, lash out at me, and are generally passive aggressive towards me. They complain about how weird I am because I never talk. They say that I’m ruining their fun because I can’t handle noise and ask them to be quiet. In the past I had even subconsciously adopted their toxic behavior myself (gossiping, being mean to others in general etc), but over the past few years I’ve started to think for myself and came to the conclusion that I don’t want to be around these people anymore, because they prevent me from being a better version of myself. 

I quit college last year because of all the stress that comes with having to meet social expectations, on top of everything that is happening at home. I feel like if I would have a place for myself where I have privacy and quietness I’d find it much easier to deal with life’s other stresses. As long as I’m still living with my family I don’t see myself going back to college or doing anything else for that matter. I’m still a minor, so I can’t just get my own apartment. I’ll turn 18 in 2 months, but even then it’ll be difficult to move out. The housing market in my country (the Netherlands) has gone through the roof so there’s no way that I can afford anything. I’m extremely desperate at this point and don’t know for how much longer I can handle this. Any advice would go a long way. Thank you for reading.",1
"The fact that relationships are a normal part of life for most people is astonishing I’m 21F and most people my age are either in relationships or sexually active. Flirting comes to them so easily and hookups are the norm. I just don’t understand. I don’t even know how to flirt, not only does it feel unnatural to me but I feel unattractive and insecure, so I’d be way too afraid of rejection. How are people so sure that they won’t be rejected? As for sex, the thought of being that vulnerable with someone you just met makes me uneasy. People are comfortable showing their naked body to a stranger? They’re not afraid of getting made fun of or rejected? They’re not afraid of diseases? They’re not insecure in their abilities? Dating, flirting, sex, relationships, and socialization in general is just a huge mystery to me and the fact that neurotypicals navigate it so easily makes me feel so useless.",1
"I feel like I'm faking it I am currently on the self diagnosis step, soon I'll talk to my psychiatrist about it. But this self discovering situation is very difficult to handle, I have many traits of autistic people, and it influences negatively my life in many ways, but I feel like I'm not ""too autistic"", I feel like if I mask I'm actually lying and I don't have autism. Plus I have a generalized anxiety and depression so many symptoms can be mistaken with autism traits. I don't know myself anymore, I don't enjoy anything, I can't live with this doubt if I'm autistic or not. Maybe I'm just so attached to this supposition because I want to prove that I'm different for a certain reason and that I'm not responsible for the way I am.
Sorry for people who are against self diagnosis, I'm not a fan of it neither but I don't have enough conditions in my country to do a real diagnosis unless there is a miracle.",1
"Please tell me things will get better. I got fired from a job I loved two weeks ago. I went into the details of that in another post here. 

In the wake of it, I feel so fucking lost. I don't know where my life is going nor where to take it. Do I just get another coffeeshop job or can I find something that doesn't require a degree?

I'm scared and overwhelmed right now. I worry about being fired out of the blue again. That lack of control and anxiety about whether people like me or not is disabling in ordinary circumstances for me, and now it's flaring up so badly.

I know I just need to take practical steps and I do think that will help ground me. I'm trying to do what I can to try and diminish the whirlwind in my head right now.

It felt awful going from making ends meet to being thrust right back into poverty and the jobhunt. Self hatred boils up in me whenever I jobhunt. I feel so inadequate and that I have no prospects. 

I want structure and stability and it horrifies me that I lost all of that so suddenly.

I'm sincerely trying to work on healing from my trauma. Therapy, books, journaling, meditating. I deeply desire a sense of security. I'm tired of chaos and setbacks. I am in a living environment where I feel a lot better than before, since my roommate is a good person and not toxic like my last roommate and my family.

I barely have any savings. I can try to ask for help from my parents, which can be like pulling teeth. They aren't very empathetic and half the challenge of this whole period of my life is that I know not to go to them to talk about feelings and the risk that they'll berate me for my perceived flaws.

I'm in my 30s. I'm so tired of living like this. I can't even imagine working and going back to school at the same time so as far as that route, I don't know.

Maybe the best thing is just to find a job that isn't customer facing, as much as I loved working at coffeeshops they also burned me out.

I hope I can take the necessary steps to better employment. I don't want every job to have an invisible time limit for when I wear out my welcome enough to get the boot. I want to feel okay about myself in my day to day life. Before I got fired that was totally fine.

"Stress is getting worse Some back story about two months ago I singed up for a driving licence. My ""teacher"" at first was fine but when I was struggling with starting the car last time he thought that it was because I didn't knew how too instead of me having hard time slowly taking my legs of the pedal. He then procided to scream at me because his course of thinking ""Oh he doesn't do that correctly when I'm calm, let's scream because fear teaches faster"". That time we were standing in the middle of road trying to start the car for about 25 minutes with him screaming profanities at me.

Point is, I can't gauge my own knowledge, the knowledge of other people, or even realise what I know isn't common knowledge as I have a hard time accepting my abilities. In addition, I'll not know that I *don't* know something when I actually do if given a prompt, which leads me to not even trying to remember if I do or not, thinking I'm stupid, then an hour later remember I know a lot about what it was.

"Am I a bad person or just taking care of my mental health? I have this best friend. She's always around me, and that's not a problem. She's cool and smart, but lately I seem to be getting tired of her. She has A LOT of problems, most of them is caused by her abusive mother. I always listen to her and I don't mind she telling me negative stuff... But sometimes she is very ignorant. When I try to help her, telling her logical things that she could do to stop the situation, she always backtalk like ""Oh, but I can't do this because..."" and then, she starts again telling me her problems and how angry she is. Many times she seems to make a stupid situation to be one of the biggest problems in the world, and that annoys me.


I started to stop giving her advice and trying to help, because she never actually tried to do anything. Today I told her I was annoyed, she answered holding my hand strongly (it even hurted a bit), and then, she stayed quiet for like, 2 hours.
At the end of our class, she was again making a big fuzz, because she forgot the money to buy her mother a surprise birthday cake. I, again, tried telling her a logical thing to do: getting home, taking her wallet and buying her mother the cake. She backtalked again ""But she will see and it will not be a surprise! She already thinks I'm gonna do it!"" then I told her ""She already knows. That's it, I'm going home.""
Suddenly, she stared at me with anger and said ""How can you be happy if you don't help other people with their problems?!"" - again, I told her ""I am happy because I only deal with MY problems.""
So... She answered me with ""I will remember that when you have a problem. How would you feel?!"" - ""Happy, because that's MY problem.""

Everyone is being supporting, everyone says I seem to have a very responsbile head on my shoulders in dealing with the loss. I been undergoing bereavement counselling and this is where the ASD diagnosis has come into play.  I think in one way ASD is beneficial for things like this. But it leaves a huge hole that i cannot fill. 

Having provided long term care for my mother who had life limiting illness and my Nana, i feel a bit lost at the moment. Like a part of my life has just vanished for ever. Providing 5 years of extensive end stage care has been very demanding and I got through it with carer support for both of them. But now I am at a loss as to what to do next. I need a vacation after the funeral arrangements have been made.

The question is what next, life goes on and so must I, but I am trying to occupy myself with all mannter of things, hit the gym, plan a bit more of my future. I feel like I am trying to fill a very large hole in my head. It just feels so empty at the moment. I seem to go through phases of emotional and then none at all. But at the core I choose to move forward. Dealing with ASD and a diagnosis has helped me recognise some of that, but it sitll feels weird.

How do people cope with such a huge change in emotional states and loss?",1
"I don't even know if i have a ""special interest"" DAE relate with it? I mean, i surely have my personal interests and i like some of them more than others but the idea of a ""special interest"" being related with autism (most people that supposedly understood about it i've met always asked me what were my special interest) just looks... random, i guess? 

I know that everybody is different and there's no rule especially since ASD is well, a *spectrum* but i feel like i've never related with this concept",1
"I think one of our major causes of depression, anxiety, and other problems is how we and general society is brainwashed (hear me out) So statistically speaking we are highly likely to have depression, anxiety, and other issues. Much of this can be directly link to our unemployment/underemployed rate, treatment, etc.

&#x200B;

I think the root of this problem is how generally we are all push for work and having exact way of life. A life that requires good income/money, people around that like you, etc. To the point our education system was literally setup to make the best factory workers and other workers out there. The problem is, there is always more unemployed looking for work vs job openings. Meaning even NT get screwed sometimes. Or in other words, we are all brainwashed and groups of us suffer for this.

People (even more in places like USA) view the job = the person. So if you hear doctor you will likely think an upstanding person. Where if you hear a fast food worker you will likely think far far far less of a person. And then given types of jobs (even more when you get into the porn industry, waste management, farming, etc) they are looked down on even if they can make near 6 figures or more. In fact, many farmers have tons of money but yet look down on due to their job.

Which means if you don't have a job, can't hold down a job, and so on. Then generally you're looked down on as being lazy, sucking on the system or whatever. In fact, I remember hearing people talk down about a homeless person they seen riding his bike. Saying he was sucking on the system and so on. I can say for 100% he wasn't get ANY help from the gov. But people jump to the conclusion as he was and he is some bad person. Basically a criminal.

&#x200B;

So when those of us hit limits in ability in getting or keeping a job.  It's like if society yelled at, the person was train all their life to, and so onto walk up a mountain. And anyone who can't is a loser, scum, whatever term you want to use. And yet everyone overlooks the person has no legs and arms. And even if the person knows they have no legs and arms, they will want to still go up the mountain and they themselves is pushing for it because they were brainwash throughout their life to do something they can't ever do.

The person will want to do the thing they can't do because they were pushed throughout their life to do those impossible things for them. The society will actively push without questioning if it is impossible, and shame the person for not being able to meet their standards they were brainwashed in having in the first place. And since there is no help in fixing the brainwash and making it where their focus now needs to be on being happy with their life. Like happy in everyday things like watching birds or whatever. The person will keep digging themselves deeper in an emotional hole until they die or something changes.

"weather on my city is unpredictable This is more of a vent.

So, since December it has been raining frequently. Almost every day. I never know what to wear, cause everyday is super hot, but then it gets cold. Sometimes it doesn't get cold. Sometimes the day it cold and suddenly  gets very hot in the afternoon. 

Today the day was beautiful! The sky was super clean, it was hot and I was planning to go swimming after work. Right when I get off my shift, it started to rain just a bit, and the sky was still a bit clean, so I thought it would be just a summer rain, you know?

But then a storm started to happen on my walk back home. My shoes (snow shoes) got all wet, even on the inside. My socks were soggy. It was horrible. I couldn't go swimming.

And the cherry top on the cake was that right when I was arriving at home i went to unlock the elevator door and the keys fell in the gap between the door and the elevator. Basically a very shitty day. There was even an argument at work, because one of my coworkers didn't want to do their assignment because they were ""taking care of personal issues"" (why even bother going to work then??)

Not even people who were the closest out of the few friends I’ve had in my life. Not a single one of the few women I found myself loving either.

"Anxiety and impostor syndrome preventing me from asking for a diagnosis. I (15M) have been suspecting being autistic/asperger for months, and i think i identify with enough of the criteria for an evaluation being worth it. My father knows about my suspects and my mother doesn't and also she has an extremely steriotypical view of the issue (while im more functionating) so i don't know how she Will react. The thing is that every time i want to tell my father i want to get a diagnosis a Big anxiety comes in and i am very afraid of telling him. This anxiety usually comes with a lot of impostor syndrome where i think maybe my symptoms arent enough and that im exxagerating. 

My problem is that in every situation i Kind of lose. If i tell my father he Will probably be supporting and convince my mother. The problem is the conversation would be akward (at least from my point of view) and i cringe to painful levels when i have to describe my feelings or mental state. Also for maybe 4 months  i Will be extremely nervous about the results, since the consequences of the diagnosis arent just a yes or no, but It would cost 600 euros to my parents, so if it's negative i would feel very guilty and like an idiot. If my mother knows about my suspects, she may not agree or think im exxagerating (although probably my father would still pay the diagnosis), if the result is positive she Will believe me and everything Will be fine, but there is a 30% chance im not autistic and i don't know what her reaction could be. 

So basicly i have been weeks trying to find a good opportunity to tell my father and when i can do It i have a panic attack and quickly change theme. What do i do. The only person that can help me our of this situation is myself and i am too coward.",1
"Is substituting water with other drinks bad for me I’m a 28 year old male with an Asperger’s diagnosis (and ADHD).

"Is it wrong to use privilege to prevent NTs from leveraging their social skills against us? I come from a somewhat privileged background and have a lot of innate traits that grant me social privileges. Innate privileges being that I’m athletic, handsome, intelligent, and very tall. These traits tend to standout to NTs more than the fact I am autistic and most of them are viewed positively by NTs.

My family more or less secures my housing and lifestyle. My family bought me a house a block away from campus for college so I don’t have to worry about going homeless or hungry. 

Due to these privileges I more often than not have soft dominance over most NTs. I’m not a soft target and nobody can leverage anything meaningful over me. So because of this I find that I can get away with being myself quite a lot at the small expense of irking some unaccommodating NTs. They try to punish me socially, but other NTs defend me because they value and respect me presumably for my abilities/privileged traits. 

My question is, is it wrong to use these privileges to negate the social leverage NTs use to walk all over us? I know not everyone, NT or ND, has the privileges I do, but I found that I can utilize my privilege as either a social lubricant or a shield. 

I just want to function and thrive and it seems so many NTs want to see me fail if I don’t conform. They seem to get upset when people succeed in spite of ignoring social expectations.",1
"Does anyone have sensory issues with physical pain? Ok so to start with I'm not even sure if this is classed as a sensory trait. For as long as I can remember I have always been very sensitive to any amount of pain where others just shrug it off.

I'd go as far as saying I can't function properly till I feel ok again or the pain fully stops.",1
"hey anyone else I abuse drugs and when I get attention I start to get out of character. Don't get it tho when I'm the shyest in-person. Sometimes say the wrong things to the wrong people in the internet which makes it worse because I'm known for being quite and not saying nothing . & i shouldn't even get to judge  especially when I'm a loser . I don't got the right to talk about nobody at all. Now I got this crippling anxiety that someone is going to expose me I let my feelings the best of me and acted out of anger and hurt. I hate myself right I'm always pushing people away when I should be happy I at least got people who fuck with me when I don't know why do they like me. when Im shy and a weirdo , when I talked on the internet to those people I was mad how people treated me in the past and trying to play me out I didn't threat but I said something like if you want smoke you know wassup knowing I'm not built for it just mood swings had me feeling that way. Now I know my only friends I had who were the coolest in the world don't care about me no more . So 40 days later I went in the internet again man I was getting attention. And since I told you all my weird ass somehow hangs with coolest guys in town don't know how. Everybody knows me and my name & while I'm getting the attention I go say something tough again this 41 days later but mind you tho when I did say the tough shit to my friends I said right after that , don't even mind what I said I don't even care but you know people like the gas things up.

"Water pressure 🚿 I recently started a relationship with the woman of my dreams. It had been awhile since I had a serious relationship, and I wasn't sure how far this could go due to my hobbies and weird habits. I recently decided to move into her house (which she bought a few years ago) and since then, she has been amazing. She has been supportive of my pornography hobby and even gave me a man cave/theater room within her home to watch. There has been one issue that's been tearing us apart though, which has been the low water pressure in our shower. As a neurodivergent person, the shower is a sanctity for me. It's a warm comfortable place where I can escape my everyday issues and just relax with white noise in the background. Having low water pressure totally ruins this experience for me and I've been feeling on edge and significantly less functional since moving in. Every time I raise the issue, she dismisses it and says I'm being a big baby. She refuses to accept how important this is to me. I understand that the house isn't everything in a relationship and it shouldn't be to her either, but sometimes it feels like she cares more about the house and her pittie than me. Any advice on how I should approach this? Is it even worth continuing this relationship?",1

"Identity Politics: Help! Okay this is going to be something of a rant and a cry for help all at the same time. And by help I do not mean advice on how to do better (though that is always appreciated) but rather affirmation that my feelings are valid and that I have real concerns that are worth people's time and energy.

I am tired of the identity politics. Trans vs cis. White vs Non-white. Straight vs Gay. Religious vs secular.

I understand that to some people these identities matter a LOT, like matters of life and death. But personally, I do not give a damn about their identities. Why should I care what your gender is? Or your orientation? Or how many gods you believe in? Or if you think the world is flat or spherical? How does believing in a specific idea, or holding a particular identity, physically/mentally/financially hurt me? I cannot see how and I cannot empirically measure any harm that it does to me.

If someone pushed me, hit me, or shot me in the stomach, THAT would be physically harmful.

If someone yelled at me, bullied me, or striped me naked against my will, that would be mentally harmful.

If someone embezzled money from me, or stole from me, that would be financially harmful.

But what do these cases of harm have to do with identity? Would the physical harm I suffer be greater if the shooter was trans instead of cis? Would the emotional harm be less if a white person striped me than a black person? Would the amount of money embezzled change depending on the gender of the thief?

No. None of it would matter. Harm is independent of identity. And therefore the case should be decided on the harm being committed, not the identity of the person in question.

Now of course the world does not operate like this. There are biases and inequities built into the systems all around us. As a White American Cis-gender Male, I am rather privileged, and I am well aware of that privilege, ever since I encountered homeless children in India as a teenager. I have also been the recipient of bullying and harassment as a child due to my social awkwardness and emotional and cognitive blind-spots due to my Asperger's.

So I have my own unique perspective on the world. I fully advocate for the dismantling of implicit biases and inequities to bring about a better world, one where people are judged on their actions, not their labels.

However, as a White American, Cis-gender Male, I feel like people see me for the aforementioned labels rather than as an individual person with a unique perspective based on unique experiences and knowledge. Now my personal experiences do not compare to people of other marginalized groups, but it sometimes feels like people too frequently or too quickly judge me for being born to the historically advantaged group without thinking that maybe there are things they do not know about me. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt because I know that however much I may THINK I know about them, there is an infinite well of material that I am ignorant of.

They also cannot see that I am autistic, and if I mention it they may take it as me looking for a license to be a jerk, or a bully, or a troll. I got into trouble on Facebook when I accidentally invoked a dog-whistle used by the Right to derail conversations about marginalization, and the person I was talking to started treating everything I said as a racist smokescreen and beat me over the head until I basically begged for help. Note that he did NOT seek to clarify my intent, even going so far as to say that impact matters more than intent, or inform me about a major mistake or miscommunication. He immediately assumed the worst of me and went on the attack.

Would he have done the same thing if I was Black? Or Trans? Or female? Or some other combination thereof? I do not know, and I cannot empirically verify whether he would or would not have.

So to end a very long and tiring post, I feel like I am being judged badly simply because I was born to a specific demographic at a specific time and place. I want a better world but I want others to treat me as though I belong in that world. I want everyone to live in a world where they are judged by their actions and granted the same grace as everyone else. And it infuriates me when I feel like this is not the case.

Now obviously this is complicated and messy. But it has been heavy on my mind for a while and I would very much appreciate advice on how to navigate the world of social justice given the labels that I carry with me, and how to assert myself to others if I feel like I am being judged for the people I resemble, not the actions I have committed. I want to do better, but I also want verification that my feelings and concerns are valid and not just brushed aside.

"Social rules for when you're meant to be included vs not Is there any way others have figured out to tell whether you're meant to be invited or included in a social situation? I tend to assume my presence is unwanted unless proven otherwise. Like I'm invited to do something or someone looks at me and says something in their conversation with the other people. 

My husband tells me that I should not hide away when my step kids visit and that they want to hang out with me. But I made myself available and after 1.5-2 hours they just continued to play a two player game and didn't even attempt to stop or ask if I wanted to do something with them. He says he doesn't want me to disappear but if you are going to leave me out of what you are doing and not even acknowledge you're doing that, then I am going to assume I should just disappear. 

I want clear, consistent rules for this type of situation because I struggle with it in many different contexts. I err on the side of assuming nobody wants me there which is probably not true in many cases but I assume it is then find evidence to support my belief because that's what brains do. I can't do this ad hoc, case by case approach because I worry that I am getting it wrong and people are annoyed with me and just being polite. But others do not routinely expect to offer reassurance like this and of course I understand that children can't be expected to do that. I don't expect that from the children. But if my husband means what he says then his actions have to match but they didn't match and now I'm just hurt and confused.

"I’m a self aware autistic narcissist and the main problem is not even my autism, it’s my narcissism Like sure I’m autistic, and it makes it harder to connect with people when ur autistic, but in my case the narcissism is the main problem. With thinking I’ve realized Its very hard for me to have a genuine connection, everything in my mind is superficial, and has to fit in some sort of deluded idea that I have. Everything was other people feels superficial in my mind. No genuine connections that much, with a sense of high importance that I have. However, this doesn’t involve my family though. With my family it’s not superficial and there’s a genuine care that I would have for them

Now I think this happened due to my childhood trauma from being autistic, and being misunderstood and treated differently due to it when I was a little kid. Overall very traumatic. So therefore it’s made me become a narcissist as a way to cope or some shit, and now I can’t genuinely connect and love like a normal person could. I’m constantly getting bored with people, and look for supply over and over again. This doesn’t apply to my family though. My trauma happened from people OUTSIDE my family, so that’s why it doesn’t apply to my family I think. It all makes sense now. So even though I am autistic, I believe that’s only a part of the problem. I don’t know bruh. I also have BPD. I remember when I was younger, before my trauma really sunk in my brain, I think I felt more genuine connections to people, and it wasn’t just about getting supply like how it is now. It explains my chronic emptiness also. All I know is, my childhood has fucked me up so badly and I’m just now starting to see it.

I really don't want to be alone; but at the same time I hear alot of girls complain about how annoying it is to be hit on all the time and it's always more important to not let my mental health issues adversely affect others. It doesn't help that I'm one ugly son of a whore.",1
"A few things I’ve noticed Me wanting to ask if me ranting about another autistic makes me sound autistic? But then being too afraid of the answer, so I stay quiet.

Me wanting to share about all the things I’ve done in my mind this week, but not in reality.

Me wanting to show emotion for a friend who just lost an in-law and has to take time to help their family deal, when I simply want to update them on crap at work that has zero bearing on their life. I do care, just can’t relate.

Me wanting to talk about the new Star Trek episode and debate it’s finer points, when they couldn’t care less and I know it. 

Me, realizing all of these things, vibing to a song I just discovered, six times in a row, still trying to figure out the meaning of the lyrics that is obviously open to interpretation and I know that, but want meaning anyway. 

Me finding a random performance of said song done drastically different than all the rest, and refusing to believe the band would have ever done that. Coming to terms with it, then saying I’ll never listen to that version ever again!

Me just wanting to wake up, go to work, have nothing different, come home, eat something I’ve eaten often, and go to bed. 

Me realizing all of this is allegedly “normal” yet has never once felt normal to me after 40+ years on this rock",1
"Do you lack empathy? People are saying that the lack of empathy at Asperger's is a myth. I am an Aspie, I want to help people and I do as much as I can because it is the right thing for me, but I dont feel empathy for them. For instance if something happens to a friend, I will try to help because I feel I have to, but I will not feel sad about them. Its like I cant emotionally care or feel sad about people because I lack some emotions and they are just replaced by my logic.",1
"Knowing that i will never be the person that i want really hurts and it's depressing I want to be the guy who is surrounded by people and respect, can laugh at jokes, has a social circle, is powerful, knows everything about what other people say in conversation.I wanted to write this message longer thanks to my english skills.  


I want to be powerful. I want control. But none of my dreams are achievable due to my aspergers and ADHD. It is really limiting and depressing and i've been laying down and rotting in house 2 years for now. Achieving dreams needs disicpline, hardwork and lonely-time. Lonely time is chosen in this situation, not all time. What about planning? ADHD ruins it. I want complete a task, my attention goes to another thing, and another so on so forth i fail to achieve the first step.   


It's like a hungry person always getting served the best food in the world but never have the ability to eat due to it not having a mouth. It is really depressing and i don't want to live like this forever.",1

"Why does everyone avoid me I feel so alone. I have always felt this way. I have never had friends. No one cares about me. No matter how many tries it has taken, everyone will always pretend like i dont even exist. I have been an outcast all my life with everyone calling me weird and too shy. I just got into high school and things feel the same again. No one is bullying me anymore, but i feel even more lonely now. At the start no one knew eachother, so i had a fresh start. I tried my everyhting to interact and be nice to everyone, despite my social amxiety. Everyone seemed nice to me back, but still no one took interest in talking to me ever again. Everyone else found friends for themselves except me. Why is it that i still dont fit in? Nowadays i feel like everyone is just trying their best to avoid me and ignore my existance. No one cares if im alone. I have been nothing but friendly and helpful towards them but i just cant seem to understamd why im still being the only one alone. I feel like i will always be the different one. Alone.",1
"Are there some things you just never learn no matter what? I don’t understand but for some reason no matter what there’s certain things I just don’t learn no matter what e.g. grammatical definitions, the names of actors, important cultural moments that are poignant to the collective I’m a part of etc…

Some things no matter how much I try to focus on them, seek to learn and remember the information it just doesn’t stick… Give it a few hours and I’ll struggle to remember this information once again as if I’m starting from fresh again. 

For other things I have no problem remembering… It’s like certain ‘types’ of data doesn’t compute… Numbers I remember very easily however some information input just doesn’t process.

"Can anyone else relate? Throughout my life, I've thought it was genuinely weird that people could be interested in things but not feel compelled to participate in them. For example, when I was a teen I was obsessed with heavy metal, and so were my friends. But most of them were happy to listen to the music and go to concerts. I wanted to play in a band. Not unusual, I know. But I distinctly remember at the time wondering how it is that someone could like something, but not get deeply involved in it.  Since then, the pattern has repeated over and over. It seems like I am incapable of just enjoying something for its own sake. I always feel compelled to **do** the thing. Now that I suspect that I have Aspergers (the official evaluation is next month), I'm wondering if this is more of an aspie trait. Can anyone else relate?",1

I just seem to come off as awkward, unable to judge the conversation, can’t read body language, unable to make eye contact. Sometimes someone will come attemp to talk to me and I just stand there in silence with no idea what to say. It’s becoming more prevalent with age (I’m 15. If I’m next to someone new, I choke up whenever trying to talk, let alone trying to move to someone/direct a conversation.

"Donating my body to Science after I'm done using it I'm currently 33, diagnosed ASD/ADHD at 29, and as I've gone deeper down the rabbit hole of autism research something disturbed me. The lack of research is disconcerting; while I would never cure my autism, I would like to better understand it for altruistic and my own selfish reasons.

Unfortunately, it seems the only way to study someone's brain is for that person to be dead (otherwise the procedure would ensure they were, sorry bad humor). I've never had any want to be buried when I pass so I always said cremate me and do whatever with it. However, the need to be dead and my lack of concern with my own body post-mortem seems to pose an opportunity. Is there any scientific community or researchers out there to contact about arranging documentation to study my body (or mind, but hey my body ain't half bad) in the pursuit of Autism research? Even if it isn't Autism related, I would be satisfied with them at least using my brain to better understand how the brain functions.

"Do you ever get in situations in where you have trouble speaking and/or interacting with some people who your friends or people you talk to interact with(especially if they’re friends with them)?

There’s one guy I talk to and he has a girlfriend. I can’t bring myself to talk to his girlfriend even if she’s already known me for long. Then there’s this guy with a skateboard whom we always shy out on each other but that he talk to coworkers who are used to me and I talk. Then there’s this young female coworker whom we’re used to talking to each other the most out of anyone and that she’s aware of autism cause she has family members who have it(and she’s bipolar), but with her mother also working the same job…I can’t get used to interacting with her friendly mother at all…

"This sub helped me to accept myself My life was a constant crisis and kept getting overwhelmed. I posted a question about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/10njv8q/do_you_live_in_perpetual_crisis/) and the people who seemed to have it under control told me it was because of 'acceptance'.

Accepting myself was hard, but I feel so much better now. Like I can finally just let go and live again. Even though acceptance is hard to explain (and maybe someone else can do it better), I want to try and maybe help some others:

It started with analyzing the symptoms and how/when they affect me. First it frustrated me, then I forced myself to cater my life to it. Even though unpleasant; I changed my routine so it now includes things I would normally not do (daily exercise, diet, sleep, socializing, self care, keeping busy, etc). 

Also I accept some things will never happen for me. A [latin proverb](https://ivakostadinova.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/hope-is-the-first-step-on-the-road-to-disappointment-latin-proverb/) says “Hope Is The First Step On The Road To Disappointment”. Wanting things that are out of reach is like torturing yourself. It's really hard to 'just let go', but it's a start to stop thinking about things that are out of reach (right now). 

The final thing that helped me was realizing that everything good comes with something bad. When the good outweighs the bad: it's good, stop thinking about it. 

Like I had to live with my parents for a while at 37 years old. They treated me like a child by being controlling, but they also gave me a home, fed me and washed my clothes. Being treated like a child has two sides to it and it sure beats being homeless. 

It was not fun to be there, but it was *good* and I am grateful for it. I apply this to everything now. Some things still suck, but accepting helps.",1

"Question about suppressing of stims Today I was at the dentist which I dislike because I can’t stim like I normally do. Not only that, but the lady kept asking me questions while poking my gums with a needle throughout the entire time!! In situations where I’m not supposed to move a lot, I find I start to become acutely aware that I’m not supposed to move. It only makes the situation worse, and as hard as I try to not move, I will eventually start to jolt a little. It’s almost like having hypnotic jerks before falling asleep, but this time I’m awake. 

She asked me if I was okay several times because I kept jolting slightly, and was overall very tense feeling.

Can autism traits and triggers change over time? So when I was younger I use to live listening to loud music. Now I just can't stand it. Makes me very agitated unless it's through my headphones.

"I'm considered quite smart, but I have a huge barrier absorbing types of information(like written), Got any tips? I do engineering work. I have strengths in with original problem solving, but not consistently fast at it.

\-Learning is very challenging depending on how it's presented to me. Spoken word can be very smooth, especially when using metaphors(which I use a lot of too). Telling me how to do something can be far more challenging than guiding me through the actions directly (like reading/telling a person how to drive vs, get in the car and start doing it).   
\-I also notice, things rarely stick with me unless they are uniquely interesting/critical, or if they are practiced over a decent period of time.   
\-visual puzzles are very fun, and I'm pretty quick to them; worded or math... not so much.    
\-I am able to grasp new/complex concepts rather quickly, again depending how they are presented to me, even ones in fields completely unpractised to me, I can understand terms/words, I've never heard before, just by using context.    
\-If given written content to learn something, like to use a simple phone app, i get very uncomfortable, I avoid it HARD, and will choose to not use the app at all or just bash my way through it until I figure it out... which can work, but I know I'm not getting the total picture on how to use the app.

"Why does it feel sad to love people? (Tw suicide) For a long time, I wasn’t sure I loved anyone but my dogs. Then I fell in love with a friend. I didn’t want to do anything about it, but having such a intense, almost obsessive feeling made me realize I did actually love other people too, like my family and a few friends.

I do not need very much from people, and get overwhelmed easily. I think I would not be able to bear the traditional intimacy of partners, I do not mean sex, just the entanglement of lives. I still love my friend, when I see them I feel happy and have energy all day, but I also feel something uncomfortable that is like sadness, it feels like my lungs are swollen. I feel this way also when I think about my dogs, who both are dead now. And when I think of my mom, who I don’t talk to much anymore. And even my dad, who I see often. 

When I fell in love with my friend, I felt creepy and insane. But I didn’t want to give up the feeling, because it made me also feel that the world was precious. Sometimes I do not talk to anyone for months. Then I do not have the swollen lung feeling, and the world is easy to pass through.

Life unfortunately gave me ASD. I'm now all alone, 24, and still struggle to make friends, get dates, and living like a normal, successful human being. It's not getting easier. There's only a few of you here that even beat the odds and have good social skills. I believe this is the key to a good life and that is my personal belief. I hope to hear from actual successes.

2. Practice on many thousands of random social circles

3. Gain close friends for feedback

"I left my friendgroup because they started to treat me differently I am really frustrated and I dont know what I should do. Sorry in advance if I make any grammar mistakes. English is not my native language.
For the context, I’m female and got diagnosed for aspergers one year ago. We were seven people in the friendgroup, I was the only female. After I got my diagnosis, everyone was supportive and I hoped that I finally had found real friends (I‘ve never had real friends because they always left me for the same reason: I was „wierd and sad all the time“). Because everyone in the group was extremely introverted, we only met for christmas and birthdays. But we played videogames every night. I like that because social events in person can stress me really fast, I tend to not go to spontaneus parties for this reason. Then, few months ago, another girl joined the group, and there the problems started to begin. She was very nice to the boys, but to me, she was… too nice. When she spoke to me, she was so calm, that she nearly whisperd. She asked me if she could tie my shoes and carry my bag for me. I tried to explain to her that I dont need her help and that I can do things by my own. But she never stopped asking me if she could help. Some of the boys started to ask me too if I need help and they made me feel like a five year old. I‘m an adult so this made me feel even more different from the others. When I asked her why she didnt ask any of the boys if they needed help she didnt have an answer. She also wanted us to meet up nearly every weekend and when I declined she accused me of hating her. Thats why I left the friendgroup. I dont know if she treated me differently because I have aspergers, and dont get me wrong sometimes I need help, but not with basic stuff like tiing shoes. I just had to get this off my chest and it still hurts me because I really liked that group. Maybe I‘m overreacting but they all made me feel lower then them. I tried to talk with some of the boys, one left the group with me because he was tired of this friendgroup aswell and the others just gave me hints that I should adjust myself.",1

This employee is talking over/interrupting customers, is monotone, and comes off rude. Calls are being escalated often and I need to find a way for them to hear what the customer hears when these calls go badly. 

I’ve attempted to coach this individual before soon after they were hired, but they became very defensive, even with a gentle, positive approach. They did get a little better temporarily following that coaching, though. 

But I’m hoping to hear different approaches or techniques from the community. 

Just on my own, I’ve come up with the following: 

•I plan on reviewing a bad call, but also reviewing a good call, providing I can find one. I’ll still review a decent call even if I can’t find one with a desired “sunshine-y” voice. I don’t want to overwhelm them with the negative. 

•Outlining what he IS doing well so he doesn’t feel like this is an attack and get defensive

•Finding multiple calls, both good and bad, and asking him to identify the strengths and weaknesses in the calls

•If he can’t find his own warm, friendly tone naturally, asking him to exaggerate what he thinks one sounds like and if it fits what we need, suggest he use that in practice. It may not sound authentic to him, but if it sounds better to the customer than how the calls currently sound, I’m okay with that. 

•When reviewing calls, asking them ahead of time to stop the call when they hear a targeted behavior like interrupting, monotone voice, etc. 

Any other suggestions? Or are any of these absolute no-no’s? 

I really want to emphasize here that I want this employee to succeed and grow, so I’m really open to anything that I can get HR to approve lol.

ETA:  While I was researching, I did see that call centers weren’t a good fit for these individuals, so I’m hoping we can be the exception here. This individual is young, out on their own, seems like they don’t have much of a social life, and was very upset about their last job not working out. They’re a very diligent worker and very by-the-book and I just want to make sure I do my due diligence and really know where they’re coming from and what their struggles are. That way, I can coach in a manner that truly reaches them and benefits them because obviously, the traditional ways aren’t working and I really want them to have a fair chance… and it’s not fair if I don’t take their challenges into consideration, so thanks in advance for all of the advice! ❤️",1
"How do I practice self-forgiveness? 2022 didn't plan out well and I can't help but resent myself. Last year confirmed for me at least that I most likely am on the spectrum - I can't grow out of my deficiencies and patterns in my life stay the same to this day.  I ended up falling out with a friend group, mostly because I was difficult, missed the chance to start dating, and allowed someone close to me to manipulate and take advantage of me.   
I've lost out on connections and golden opportunities, and even if I can make up for these mistakes I can't outrun the regret or trauma of being treated badly.

&#x200B;

How can I learn to forgive myself? I've been tearing myself up inside for too long and it's not getting easier. I've ended up in a spiral worse than at any other point in my life. I cannot let things go and fearful these past 12 months have knocked me down for good.",1
"Did anyone else ""pretend"" as a kid? When I was a little kid and far lower functioning I would do this thing that I called ""pretending"" where I would find something with a good texture (Like a sock or blanket) and just kind of squeeze it between my fingers, I'd close my eyes and use the pleasant texture to focus my thoughts and I would just contemplate, and daydream, and fantasize, but I had to keep feeling the texture or I would lose focus.

I was always doing it as a kid, this was obviously what made my parents know I was autistic because I constantly did it everywhere, I often did it with the rim of my shirt at school, and when kids asked what I was doing I'd respond with ""pretending""

This stim faded with age as I became more socially aware, but I still start doing it by muscle memory when I'm relaxed and start daydreaming.",1

"Anyone into programming? I've been programming for like 6 maybe 7 years now. I'm not amazing, I mean that's why I'm going to college for it I guess. I am self taught, but I always wanted to get better.

Why am I posting here? Excellent question! In probably the most stereotypical manner for aspies, I am posting to see if anyone else that enjoys programming would like to chat, and maybe work on projects together. I would love to have someone to bounce ideas off of and learn from, or just talk to someone who gets it.

Hope you all have a nice day!",1
"Advice please: Some aspies are really gifted in certain areas and I've finally found mine, but am now struggling with ¿envy? from others. I don't think I'm superior at all (I can list my struggles and flaws) but somehow I reflect the short-comings of others and they resent me for it... For nearly two decades I'd struggled with mental health and self-esteem, and now I've found flow in an area where things come easily/naturally to me. I can't express how grateful I am to have found my \*thing\* in life, and my family/friends/partner are really happy for me to see things (finally) working out.  
 I've been in a position where I wasn't as good as other people at something and learnt to graciously recognise they have a talent that I simply don't - its no one's fault.   
In this new field I have very quickly picked up a skill to a strong level (but lack knowledge). When asking for help, which I ask for in a clear, specific, grateful manner (and I ask others to check my phrasing too) people (NTs?) seem to interpret it as arrogant.   
How can it be arrogant if I'm asking for advice? I'm literally sharing an area of ignorance/inexperience/inadequacy and its somehow rubbed people up the wrong way. I realise the level of skill absolutely does not equate to the time spent learning it, which although is a lucky gift for me, seems to curse me as annoying or intimidating to others. Dude, I'm trying to get by just like everyone else, and now I have a chance. Life is hard enough.   


I'm trying to not be upset because I want solutions and to develop my craft further, but I can't help remember the way people treated me at school (15 years ago).   
I know it's an egoic reflection of others and not me, but when its a certain volume of people reacting this way, that gets difficult to hold on to. I try so carefully to think and phrase things as politely as possible, pre-empt misinterpretations, even specify what I'm \*not\* saying.   
I'm the common denominator here, so of course I automatically look inward at what I've done/said wrong, what/if something needs adjusting or improving, but I know (as do the people around me) that I have pure and simple intentions to just learn better. But inexplicably, something about me irks others. I've been told time and time again its envy, but it feels arrogant and bizarre that people would envy me.  


Any advice or perspectives that might help would be greatly appreciated.",1

"It is possible to for an aspie to be empathetic and understand sarcasm/facial expressions? I've never fit in with anyone. Have always been awkward and weird in school, teacher used to treat me different, people(even my classmates) baby-talked and were gentle with me because they thought there was something wrong with me.

I have a few of the signs--getting obsessed with one topic for a period of time, trouble making eye contact, need clear instruction. I'm not an emotional person, but I'm able to understand why somebody is angry or crying.

When I watch movies, I'm able to read the actor's facial expressions even when they're not talking. I can sense the atmosphere. I understand different tones of voice.

I know what to do, but I get too anxious and embarrassed to actually do it. Like, in school, the teacher would look around the room when discussing a topic, and stare at random students--like a que to give an opinion. She'd look at me a few times, and I KNEW she wanted me to talk, but I was too shy to talk in front of the class.

I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I assume I have either social anxiety or Avoidant Personality Disorder. I'm well able to understand other peoples' body langauge and speaking tone, so I don't know if I could be autistic.

I'm not a teenager, BTW. I'm an adult.",1
loud thoughts Have you ever had the sensation of your thoughts being so loud and preasant in your head that you feel like they are being telepathically broadcasted to everyone around you?,1
The way I wish managers would learn to work with me I wish they'd just come to me calmly and tell me what I did wrong and what I can do to correct it and also what I'm doing right. Getting only negative or only positive reinforcement isn't good. There needs to be a balance. I feel like a lot of NTs don't understand how to work this way with us since they mostly react on emotion. I'm sick of people who are unfit to be managers or run a business just being assholes cause they're in charge and are on a power trip.,1
I just got enrolled in a summer program at a college. Basically a friend of mine told me about this program he wants to attend at this collage made for people like us. Apparently it’s supposed to be very interesting and will last for a entire week! I’m looking forward too it personally & even have the option of enrolling at this place full-time. I’m actually kinda happy as I can finally be in an area with other people like me.,1
"Anyone else find it hard to find friends who are patient enough to understand you and your “struggles” with life and society. More and more I find that it’s hard making friends when on the ASD spectrum.

I feel like no matter how hard I try to work on myself and be better, people eventually ghost me or leave me entirely. No one ever reaches out, I’m always the one who has to put in the effort to make things work, and it’s fucking exhausting. 

I know I have my problems, everyone does, but I just don’t know what else to do.

I try to be as kind and understanding as I can be towards others, as I truly care about others and just like wanting to see myself happy, I want to see others happy too, as Ik the pain one may go through each day can be hard to bare.

At this point I am ready to give up on making friends with people in a society that isn’t designed to accommodate someone who is like me. 

It’s getting too exhausting and painful.",1
"I had a question for everyone here.. So, my sister was diagnosed with aspergers and I wanted to know how I can best help her. She's high functioning, if that matters here (I don't know much about the spectrum, sorry..). I just want to know so I can support her the best I can. I try to help with schoolwork and other things but I feel as if it doesn't reach her. Any advice would be greatly appriciated!",1
"Could use some support. I am struggling and am scared I am diagnosed ADHD and sensory processing disorder, and suspected ASD (my therapist believes I am autistic). I am also a single mom and am currently the only working parent (my ex is unemployed) providing for our child. 

I shifted from remote to in person work last year as a way to earn more money, and it has been hands down one of the most stressful years of my life. The main issue I faced, was a coworker whom was hired to be on my team ended up having a lot of drug issues and harassed me inside and outside of work for almost 8 months. Not to mention she was frequently absent due to her drug use and her entire workload fell onto my shoulders completely. She was eventually brought a weapon into the office so she was fired, but since then, her workload became my permanent responsibility. So I have been doing the work of two people for an entire year. Not to mention I work in advertising, so the clients at this company have been borderline abusive, so we have had a lot of meetings with HR about this as well. Like I said, it’s been a shit show.

I have been burned out for so long, that I am starting to get frightened by myself. I feel insane. I surpassed all the late stage burnout symptoms in December, now I am left with just apathy, pain, anger and strong, constant emotional outbursts. This has also manifested into some physical issues that my work has not been very accommodating towards at all, so I am dealing with all of that while trying to fly under the radar while struggling tremendously. Im at the point where I would honestly rather stop living than continue coming into this job every day and as a mother, that frightens me. 

I literally am at my wits end. I don’t know where to go from here. I can’t take any time off work, because nobody else is able to fill in for me. I also don’t have enough PTO accrued this year to be able to take any time off. I have received a doctors note to work from home more due to physical issues I am having, but my boss was not happy about it and so I caved and have been coming in every day despite being in pain.

I know I am not great at advocating for myself, but I was raised by an autistic father who taught me to hide my real self as much as possible otherwise I will be unemployed and homeless. 38 years of believing that is hard to erase. In the meantime, logistically, what are my options? I cannot physically continue on this way, and I am looking for other jobs but that takes time.

Anyone have any ideas of how I could get some time off without losing my job and my son losing his insurance? I am moving back in with my family in May which will help, but I don’t think I can force myself through this current situation for another two months without something scary potentially happening as a result of my mental state.",1
"questions about hobbies/obsessions. Hi. I have a few questions, as the title says. I'm not on the spectrum (diagnosed anyways) and I just wanted to talk about my weirdness, because I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about it.
 The first thing I remember having an obsession with was SpongeBob SquarePants. Growing up in the early 2000s, it probably wasn't uncommon. The second time was when the movie Frozen came out. I was addicted. I wanted to know everything about it. I spent hours learning the songs in multiple different languages, watching behind the scenes, and even getting interested in art and animation because of it. Others include Fallout 3, Minecraft, cranes (the vehicle) painting, sculpture, and The Long Dark.

The main reason why I'm asking about the possibility of being on the spectrum is because I'm not always having moments like this. Right now (and for the previous few years on and off) it's writing and the Sims.

Any thoughts?

TLDR: is my tendency to get obsessed with certain activities/things a symptom of ASD?",1
"I really want the opinions of Aspies and other folks who like participating in this subreddit on this? Okay so people say that aspies and low supports needs autistic people are often “talented people who just have a little bit of trouble understanding people sometimes”. If that’s true, then why does it seem like most if not all of us want to unalive ourselves to some degree. I’m just saying, pretty much every aspie and low supports needs autistic person I’ve met battled sewerslidal thoughts, at least to some degree at some point. That makes it hard for me to believe that our only problem is “having a little bit of trouble with understanding people sometimes”. I don’t think having minor trouble understanding people here and there would make someone want to die. So there’s got to be more to it than that. Anyone else see where I’m going with this?",1
"Going to a social even where you embarrassed yourself in a serious way, and I already feel drained To explain it short: my social skills are -145. Very often I say stuff that comes across wrong and then I can't explain, because the emotions throw me off.

Last time, I fucked up greatly. We were talking about censorship and I quoted a paragraph from an older book. Not going into this, but it includes a term in my language, which was used to describe black people. Not like the N-word, but rather like the Spanish way of saying ""black"". Welp. Turns out, in our culture, this term has now risen from an ""old-fashioned uncomfortable"" term to... well, being the N-word. Basically.

I didn't know that. Of course I didn't. I knew it was uncomfortable so I even put air quotes. But still everyone went silent and the only black person at the table (because that's my luck) simply said that white people aren't even ""allowed"" to say it. Not even if quoting a text.

I never called anyone that term. I never do. I was just trying to use an example. And now everyone thinks I'm a racist. And I couldn't even apologize because she was quickly out the door when it ended.

"Is It normal that when you are aware of your differences with most people (example: bad socialitation, weird actitude...) You start to consider others as inferior and you start getting a high ego basicly maybe as a way of coping with the differencies i experience in relation to other people i have developed a sense of my emotions and thoughts forming a ""safe space"". like the combination of all my interests and points of view is something that form my personality and this leads me to maybe hate people that are less similar to me. since always i have developed friendships based on similar interests and how similar the person is to me (as a kid i wanted to clone myself so i could be my own best friend). so basicly when i see people consider me as weird mainly in the social aspect i think to myself that those things form who i am, and it doesnt matter if its good or bad because it's mine.

it is really difficult to explain and i probably sounded narcissistic but in a summary it is thinking about all the things that form your identity/personality as superior (not neccesarily believing you are better than other people but simply having a lot of ego)

this has to do with the fact i know my mind cant be really shared as a pack. because of this i have always wanted a deep psycho analysis to have someone know every details of my mind or i wish conciense could be storaged in a digital unit.",1
"This is just a vent This is just a vent because I don’t really have anyone to talk to. My wife doesn’t understand.

I am just frustrated that our entire society revolves around how social you are. If you aren’t talkative and social I feel like you are perceived as inferior or defective and you suffer in society. For example I love BJJ, however, I am always struggling to find partners to work with and people to roll with because I’m not sociable so I am not integrated with the class. As a result I end up getting stuck with partners who are brand new and don’t know anything so my ability to train is hampered. I also struggle to find people to roll with at the end of class because everyone has cliches and I don’t fit in them. 

This applies to my career as well. I’m not a “popular” therapist or desired therapist amongst patients at work because I am not a small talker and don’t enjoy chit chat. Again just venting as I’m frustrated with my life and current circumstances. I feel like I’m metaphorically stuck in high school at the lunch table alone. I don’t want friends or to socialize but I also don’t want my life experiences to be hampered due to my aversion to be a socialite.",1

"In the spirit (ba-dum-tish!) of a recent thread, does anyone else feel “fixed” on clonazepam? I didn’t reply to [this recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/11iis65/does_anyone_else_feel_like_ur_normal_under_the/) because I related to it so much I feared I’d find it triggering. The Demiurge made the thing that gives me one of the strongest senses that life is worth living, extremely unhealthy. Good job. Alcohol scares me very much. I hate to love it.

Do any other folks on the spectrum find the same holds true for clonazepam, almost as strongly? I’m well aware, both professionally and personally, that people who like alcohol a bit too much for their own good, seem to overlap strongly with people who like benzos a bit too much for their own good. But there’s something special, specifically, about clonazepam. I find it just much more motivating and conducive to a deep sense of wellbeing and social aplomb, in a way that matches alcohol (minus the excessive sedation and body load!) in a way that other benzos don’t.

It goes without saying, unless you’ve surrendered to nihilism in all its forms, that both alcohol and benzos are traps that are hard to escape, take a huge toll on QOL, and are to be avoided if at all possible. But boy oh boy if they (especially clonazepam) make life and society feel a whole lot more tolerable.",1
"Non-verbal vs. verbal communication - preference? As I age, I find myself becoming more at peace when I can communicate without words, especially when it has to do with my love language. I honestly just ask my S.O. if we can just look at each other without talking, and we smile, cry, and laugh together without much more than maybe breaking the silence with the odd ""I love you"". As an aspie I feel my inner self at peace when I can feel at home talking without actually talking with another person. Words are so... Definitive. So... Pointy, edged, and narrow. While on the other hand, non-verbal communication is so comforting to me, its like I can take off the shell, and the mask I have to wear and be innocent, feel pure, just like floating on a cloud as the wind brushes against my face. Language to me can be so incredibly tiring. Can you relate to any of this?

"People are starting to accuse me of being ""on the spectrum"" I am currently 16M and am in high school. I have mild Asperger's, and my parents and teachers know. 

However, I do not want my peers to find out. I think I would be less popular, and that people would look down on my/feel bad for me if they knew. It is a harsh truth, but I think people on the spectrum are lowkey seen as inferior and felt bad for, I know I tend to dislike neurodivergent people (I don't dislike them FOR being neurodivergent, but the behaviors they exhibit as a result of this annoy me).

I also feel like people knowing I have Asperger's would hurt my chances of getting a gf.

"I think one of the things that means the most to me is when someone I like sits next to me on purpose It hardly ever happens, and this is not important. I am just trying to preserve this feeling. I find groups so hard to be around, that in class and meetings, I will usually find the person I like the most, and sit in a place near their vicinity, but not obviously next to them, because I am worried they will be annoyed. This gives me a feeling of safety, like someone is acting as a filter between me and the unfiltered energy generated by a large mass of humanity haha. 

A few days ago, I had to go to a giant meeting for my job. I sat kind of in a corner away from the main group, which was nice because no one was behind or next to me. One of the people I care most about in world came over and sat in the seat immediately in front of me. I do not think it was on purpose, but he turned around and talked to me a few times. I kept expecting him to get up and go sit with someone else, but he stayed there for the rest of the meeting. 

The feeling reminds me of when my dogs used to wake up and get out of their beds, just so that they could jump onto the couch and sleep next to me. I know it is not actually anything, but I think this is one of the most precious solaces I know, when someone I like sits near me, possibly on purpose.",1

"Obsession over bad word I gained an obsession with a horrible word recently, I cannot stop using it in my head to refer to myself and to others. Sometimes it is meant to insult myself, sometimes it is not related to context at all. I have enough self control to know never to say it in person or online, but it is unpleasant because the word is a slur.

I'm a man of 37yo, aspie with ADHD. I'm working in IT and got a new job that I really enjoy for a few months now.

During  last session with my therapist, I mentioned that I'm quite struggling  to focus during meetings, specially when working from home. He replied,  quite informally that Lion's mane could help me, he didn't say more  about it.

I read quite a lot of  testimonies about it here and on r/Nootropics,  I have to say I'm quite scared now. Every  online shop never mention side effects but I've read about, fog,  headaches and people feeling dumber after taken some.

Should  I still try it? I can't ""afford"" being ""dumb"" with my new job, what is  your opinion? Is there better alternative to keep focus? I'm already  taking Zafran and Gaba, could it interfere with Lion's mane?

They feel I have spent money foolishly because I have been trying to invest in real estate. The tax deeds and liens are going slow but am not losing money. Tonight they asked my brother about how I can cut my expenses and he innocent suggest changing hair dresser. Then I think my brother is being an asshole the hair dresser is not the cheapest but that yearly expense is not the problem.

"Feeling unlovable. It's triggering suicidal thoughts TLDR; I feel unlovable due to past traumas and nothing I do seems to work (and I've done a lot). I'm thinking of ending things.

Hello, I am a 24 y/o M, diagnosed last year.  I'll try my best to explain my situation but it might get a little convoluted.

I always felt different to everyone else (I figure that's somewhat the norm here). I was always considered ""gifted"" intellectually .  I am also extremely empathetic and sensitive, which I personally would prefer to not be: It's hard to cry for watching a sunset when you are a male, specially in the Latin american society where I live which is more conservative.

Since I was a kid I had social issues because I come from a very dysfunctional family, which gave me a very deep abandonment wound, so I didn't get the support I needed to understand social norms and basically had to learn everything the hard (and very traumatic) way. My father was present but unable to provide and work and give a masculine figure, and my mother always made me feel like an obligation to her, and conditioned her love to my results in life. This made me very insecure and unable to see worth in myself and my accomplishments, which is something I still struggle with today.

So I was also raised in a high-society school and college when I didn't really have any money given the financial hardships of my family, which further broadened the feeling of never belonging. Throughout all my life I've never felt I have belonged anywhere, in any social groups. What's crazy is that other people don't think that, they think I have friends and I am a normal person, I am just too good in masking my suffering.

Regarding romantic relationships I only had one  with which I lasted two months. All my life my main goal was to replace that love my family never gave me with a couple and I have never been able to do it. I usually give too much too son, because of my abandonment wound, and also my aspie side makes me act always in an ""all or nothing"" mindset, meaning that if I receive a setback I usually leave, because I think the other person doesn't want me anymore, or just because of my hyper sensitivity it hurts so bad that I can't stand being alive.

I have done everything to get a partner:

* I tried so hard to love myself (and succeeded to a degree). Did my best to discover my identity
* Learned about my past trauma, went to therapy for a year (where I got my Aspie diagnosis) and worked very hard to overcome it
* Started lifting and got a reasonable good physique
* Learned social skills (heck, I even paid 3000 USD for a personalized social coach)
* Learned about women (had my red pill phase which I have now overcome)
* Bought new clothes,  polished my social media accounts, made female friends who I constantly ask about how to treat a woman

This ""improvements"" made more girls attracted to me (and also this  girls are more physically attractive) but everything stays the same at the end of the day.

To be honest, I would make such a good partner from a logic standpoint. I am a good person, I make very good money from a remote position in a US company as a software engineer living in Latin America. It hurts me everyday deep in my heart to see how everything I do seems to be in vain.  At least three times I have dated girls, which dumped me and went back with their exes less than a month later. Thing is I am so hurt that I keep attracting hurt people who either manipulate me or are not ready for relationships.

I also thing my character seems to ward off girls since sometimes I can't stand things that they do. For example I had a date yesterday with a very high value girl, and she arrived almost 40 minutes late. I left and let her know I was angry, but thing is culture here kinda allows a degree of late arrival to meetings, it's just that I don't do that and let her know beforehand I wanted her to be on time. But other people can stand that and end up in relationships. I think I should chase them more sometimes, but it's also unfair to receive these kind of treatments as a man since they are signs of disrespect, and I don't think that's an asperger thing only. Perhaps I should just accept them and lower my worth.

I see people manipulating girls and getting them hooked, and honestly sometimes I wish I could do that but I think I am way too good with girls given my empathetic side, I have very smart friends who are cold and calculating, I am a very weird example of someone who is sensitive and calculating.

I have been alone all my life, I felt left behind by mi family, my friends, and many many potential partners. I have given up the chance to be happy with my current self,  because every setback deepens the trauma and the feeling that something is wrong within me that makes me unlovable.

After failing countless times, all of which have hurt so so bad, I realized I am trying to get the love my mother didn't give me from a partner.  My last attempt is to try to get my parents to work out our situation. I am not sure if it's gonna work. A month ago a girl I was hoping to get into a relationship with cut with me and I have cried every day since, I feel like my life is a loop where I feel good when a potential partner appears which usually lasts a month and then I feel terrible after it eventually ends for four or more months. This is no way to live.

I am thinking of leaving the country taking advantage of my remote work, and start over a new life. I know people will suggest I should try to fight and fix my problems, but I have tried all my life and failed. Everyday I see signs that bring back traumatic memories and make me cry for hours.

I want to ""die"", metaphorically, meaning i want to forget everything that happened here forcefully and begin fresh trying to forget my traumas. I will try this until I am 30. If it doesn't work, I am trying to come to terms that I should end my life. I would never have kids with these depressive episodes, they don't deserve that.  I have had phases where I considered suicide throughout my life, but I don't know, this time it feels different, I just feel I am close to exhausting all the options I had.

Perhaps a good way to visualize the sadness I feel is listening a song I made for the last ""almost relationship"" (how I hate that combination of words) I had:

"Has anyone else noticed this pattern among the men and women members of the show, series, Love On The Spectrum? This is a pattern that i've noticed about that series, and i believe other people observe it too, it seems that the typical female, woman member of the show, series, has dated plenty or had plenty of boyfriends before, or has had at least 1 long term boyfriend in her life.

But the typical, not all, but majority of the male members of the show, have never had a girlfriend before, never dated, or have just dated very little in their life, maybe a short-term relationship or something. 

It does feel and look like a cruel difference, but at the same time, i figure it should not be a shock or a surprise as to why its like that.

I don't like it but its just part of nature, the world, reality, being cruel at times in many areas of life.",1
"Could how parents raise a child with autism affect how well they function? I know there’s a spectrum and everything, but I was wondering if some of the more problematic effects of autism could be magnified by parents who see autism as more of a problem than a unique difference raise their child.

I’ve heard some of the stories of “autism moms” being awful in how they raise them, and it sounds like their children are often the ones with worse symptoms.

My parents didn’t even know I had Aspergers and raise me normally and were overall patient, and I turned out pretty smart and capable of sustaining myself unless very stressed out.

Could poor raising have drastic effects on the symptoms of autism that last to adulthood?",1

"What counts as ""bottoms""? I asked a question to one of my support workers lastweek, about what im allowed to wear in my own home when support staff are with me in my home. It gets very hot in the summer now, and I do not do well with heat. So to cope I wear as little clothing as I can to stay cool. 

I asked my support worker what they were comfy with me wearing (they basically said as long as I am wearing underwear it dosnt bother them).

But today I got a letter that reads:

""Please can we ask that when a support worker arrives, you need to have on a top and bottoms on - that covers your genital area adequatley. This is to protect the welfare of both Support staff and you. If you are not correctly attired, we would be unable to support you that day.""

What counts as ""bottoms"" though? Its about as clear as mud to me. Underwear? Technically covers my genital area. Just trousers/jeans? 

And ""protect the welfare of support staff"" what does that even mean!? What do they think I do when support are with me! 

A few times when support staff have been in my home, I have been wearing nothing but a top and underwear. Never heard anything negative from anyone about it, staff never told me to put anything else on. Ive been topless in shorts with them in my house before, again no issues from anyone about it. A couple times I have even been wearing nothing BUT underwear when it was 35c inside my house! no one said a thing about it negative or otherwise. 

Im waiting to hear back from them about the letter, cos I dont understand it much. And im not overy keen on what they are insinuating with the whole ""welfare"" statement either. 

What do you think it all means? Im very confused about it and, a bit annoyed really. Its MY house that THEY come into.....and no member of staff has ever said anything negative to me about it. Never told me to go put something else on or told me off for it either. So like................wha",1
"Concept maps, graph theory, and learning styles A big breakthrough moment for me was realizing that I learned things differnetly. My mother called it ""learning the hard way"" and initially that's how I saw it, until I realized it was more nuanced than that, in that I needed to understand something from base principles for it to make any sense, and that I sucked at learning just from memory. 

Fast-forward many years and I'm still fascinated by the hows and whys of this, and coming across this subreddit brought a load of new questions that were salient to me that relate to this issue.

Today I was reading up on graph theory which lead to learning about ""concept maps"". This stuck a chord with me in relation to how I like to map out information in my learning methods, and so I wondered whether this would be particularly useful to those on ASD spectrum. Sure enough there is a study on it. For anyone interested:

I don't really want to get diagnosed though, I've heard it's pretty difficult especially if you're somewhat older.

"I was offered a major promotion at work, but I feel I will never reach hapiness, no matter how much effort I put into my life At age 32 I finally found a workplace that I didn't completely hated.

Not that I don't deserve it working so hard, but I thought it would take at least two more years before being considered and maybe not even then due to me being autistic.

But here I am, I will be in charge for 150 people. I was very excited and proud. I am somewhat nervous, but I want to take this chance.

Few hours later though, dark thoughts creeped back in. I was thinking how much effort and positivity I put into all my life and yet can't find one woman that would want to spend time with me. I went on another first date just 4 days before all that, again rejected.

"Anyone relate to this work pattern? When I look back at my life, I realize I never held a job longer than two years. 

It hit me recently that I tend to follow this particular unique pattern and am really curious if any of you can relate. Here it goes:

I jump in with both feet and really enjoy learning the ins and outs of a new job. This phase is by far my favorite. I tend to go above and beyond and love the learning curve. It’s like solving an exciting puzzle. I am entirely focused on it and soak it up. 

At this stage, socially I enjoy getting to know people and it’s like a honeymoon stage. 

At around the 8 month mark, once I get all the logistics down and the learning phase ends, things seem to take a drastic turn. I start to struggle with boredom and resulting mental anguish. I also start to notice petty office politics more and more, and they start to cause me immense stress and burnout. 

At this stage, I try to be friendly with everyone, make excuses for their behavior, try even harder to please and do nice gestures to try to protect myself from the stresses of office politics and often arbitrary cattiness. At this point I still have faith in people and internalize blame more and more. 

About a year into my job, I am starting to feel extremely bitter and disillusioned. The many arbitrary, nonsensical rules that are inefficient (I generally speak up about these respectfully and try to change them systematically, most often with small to no success) are completely wearing me down. 

Having observed patterns of dynamics for a while at this point, I soak up everyone‘s feelings and pick up on the smallest dishonesties and dynamics and can predict people’s behaviors to the T. Everyone else seems to be blind to this and it’s painful to see them walk around manipulated and buying into dynamics without seeing the writing on the wall. 

It also becomes a lonely and harrowing experience, (I don’t know how else to explain it) but picking up lying and overall dynamics and predicting things accurately no one else seems to is lonely and intense. It’s almost like I have X Ray vision for the ugly hidden motives and don’t want to - like seeing the cancers in everyone that walks by and it tainting everything and not being able to get it out of my mind. 

It’s hard to explain, because I can be oblivious to certain things more than the average person yet can pick up on dishonesty and scheming and predict certain outcomes way more than the average person. 

By a year and a half, I am utterly exhausted and burned out by it all. The lack of learning new things is demoralizing and it also leaves way too much room for my attention to absorb the above. It’s almost like focusing on new intellectual challenges (besides them being immensely rewarding) also protects me from having bandwidth to absorb the politics bs.

By the end of two years I am a shell of myself. Utterly physically and emotionally exhausted. Feels like my “skin” is raw and dealing with office politics is acid poured over it. I just want to run away and be a hermit, be at home in a cocoon reading and gardening and getting away from all the corrupt BS. It’s like other people let it all roll off their back with a thick skin but it destroys me.

I have generally been successful in grad school and praised at my jobs (though also picked on and bullied by some), but I can’t seem to avoid the above. 

I have been home for almost a year since my last job (on disability for other health issues) and I am just slowly recovering from the profound burn out it caused me. 

Can anyone relate? Any thoughts and general feedback? Any tips or coping tools you might be able to share?

Thank you so much for listening and am excited to hear from you!",1
"Making friends for me is simple enough and doable, but maintaining friendships is practically impossible I keep getting bombarded with social media posts about the importance of making friends, so that's what brings me here. 

First of all, I've already learned how to make good first impressions, build rapport, get the other person to talk about themselves and find common interests. Sure, I don't have Austin Powers levels of charm, but I can make friends about as well as the next guy. 

But I can't keep friends for very long. Which in turn makes me stop wanting to make friends in the first place, because I know that I'm probably going to end up getting overworked by the friendship and have to end it. I get so tired out from the energy that goes into friendships that it feels like a second job. Sometimes, it feels like a third job, because dealing with my comorbidities feels like I'm managing a big and hectic project in my mind. 

How do you autistics here manage to maintain friendships? Is there any way to decrease the mental load? Anything at all that you share can be a huge source of help. Shout out to all the other autistics on here who are dealing with the same thing",1
"What is your opinion on prenatal screening for autism? I see a lot of discussion and debate happening regarding neurotypicals but very little to nothing about the near future of prenatal testing and the fact a routine prenatal ultrasound can identify early signs of autism.

I feel like this really does not get enough attention and is much closer to reality than many think. A future without autism could be a feasible reality if prenatal testing is done for autism.

In such a reality babies with signs of autism could technically be aborted after a positive test result. At the same time this could also be used to provide better more specific care.

What do you think about this?

"Dating Troubles(Advice needed) Hi everyone I'm new to the community, but I've been a long time lurker. I decided to make a reddit account today and make this post, so sorry if my post isn't formatted the best and is long.

**For some context:** I'm a female in my 20s, and I have aspergers and anxiety disorder. I have never dated before, but I've found myself getting more attention recently after improving myself a lot, ie: weight loss, and taking care of myself.

I've been trying to get into dating for around the last year. I've tried dating apps, but I find myself getting very anxious. I'm more of the loner type. I've only talked with around 5 guys and the pattern is the same. we chat for a few minutes, he wants to take me out and I don't feel comfortable enough to do it. Everything just seems to happen too quickly, when I need more time to get to know and be comfortable with someone. But me wanting to build up a relationship is treated like an inconvenience. I also start to realize that I'm not picking up on a lot of the social cues, when I look back it's so obvious, but in the moment I can't really see it. For example: the cashier at a local sandwich shop was obviously flirting with me, but I didn't really notice. I gave him my number, cause I genuinely thought that it would go to the owner for a job prospect. I didn't expect him to text me later on that night asking for a date.  Another huge concern is the amount of boys that are picking up on the Andrew Tate/manosphere ways of thinking, that make navigating a relationship for me even harder. It may seem like I'm overprotective of myself, but I know from the past that I can get taken advantage of very easily by others if I'm not careful. 

If I had to compare my dating life to something, I would say I'm that one girl in a dating sim that never seems to emotionally connect with the player, unless you interact with me a lot and then it clicks for me one day. But by that point most players, would have tried their hands at another girl.

I know I'm young, but I'm beginning to worry that I might not be built to have a ""normal"" relationship with someone. I would love more than anything to find a lifelong partner, but the ways things are going I'm not really sure.

I hope I was able to explain what I mean. **Is there any advice that anyone can give me to help navigating dating with aspergers a bit easier. And is there anyone else that feels the way I do?** Sometimes I do feel life I'm the only one that does. Thank you for any advice.",1

"Good life hacks for telling the difference between committing to an explicit set of tasks, versus committing to a social role, involving a complex set of explicit and unspoken obligations? As fellow people who naturally struggle at reading people, reading the room, and reading the air, I’m sure this is a life pain to which many of you relate. I can’t count the number of times it’s happened to me. A few times, the toll on my sense of wellbeing and self-worth was so unexpectedly great that I was near suicidal (getting into medicine as a career being by far the biggest and worst)

Generally it goes like this. I’ll answer a call-out for people interested in doing task X. I’ll ask a lot of probing questions about what exact steps task X involves, and what contributions toward this task are asked or expected of me. Liking these explicit terms and on paper bringing a lot to the table, I commit. Often enthusiastically, and to great first impressions.

Things go well for a short time. But then, out of seemingly nowhere, my coworkers are angry at me. Sometimes they don’t want to tell me why, or don’t think they should have to. So I approach my supervisor or immediate *senpai* in private, in the spirit of clearing up misunderstandings and setting things right. But how I describe my *modus operandi* and way of conceptualizing the duties of the work makes him/her *more* appalled, concerned, and often righteously indignant with me, rather than understanding. At worst, (s)he’s inspired to put me in my place, and tell me to FIFO.

I’m unpleasantly surprised and offput, since in my mind I’ve so far committed to and done exactly what was asked of me, no more no less. But apparently this wasn’t enough. Not *nearly* enough. The organizers, funders, and supervisors of Task X were counting on me (and all new recruits) to pick up on the fact that their explicit expectations were merely indicators of much deeper temperamental and behavioral patterns they couldn’t explicitly ask about or screen for. And, along the same lines, a whole lot expected of me (and all new recruits) was unspoken and unwritten, and not easy to anticipate or put into explicitly binding language. And the appalled reaction I’m getting, is their realization that someone passed through their filter without actually getting it or accepting it at all. At worst, I’ll find myself regarded and treated as a piece of riffraff who snuck into the party uninvited, or gamed their system for my own selfish benefit. I find this kind of reaction not only shocking but hurtful too — it was not my intention to exploit or to take on something I wasn’t qualified for. *If someone had had it in them to spell out exactly what was expected of me*, I would’ve gladly been on my way and been no trouble to anyone.

"When are we going to start having collective unity? How come we are routinely excluded, ridiculed, and targeted by neurotypical scum that sees us as walking jokes to poke fun at? Every single user on this subreddit gets bullied, excluded, heckled, and otherwise treated different and treated as subhuman.


How many of us have neurodivergent friends? I have a couple and when I met them we instantly connected in ways that I never connected with NTs. 


We connected in seconds in ways I haven't done with an NT in years.


I know the ""us vs them"" mentally is frowned upon, and I do not urge some kinda conflict between us and them. But come on, every other group of people on this planet got the idea to form a collective unity. Meanwhile, the Martin Luther Kings and Ghandis of the aspie community push us to try to get accepted by the NTs and with a little more trying love will pave the way.


Do I believe with a little more love all our troubles will end? I don't believe it. I do believe that aspies should focus on forming clubs for themselves to advocate for ourselves. Something like 70% of us go most our life unemployed. Neurotypicals routinely use nepotism to give each other decent jobs, why don't we do the same? 


The dating world is hell for us but it doesn't have to be if we had a system in place for aspies to meet other aspies.


Almost all of us get bullied in school to the point we grow up with severe psychological trauma, and those who run the schools don't want to waste resources on the 1 in 50 kids who are different. Worse, teachers usually pair us with the most disruptive students so they harass us and leave the rest of the class alone, using us like a bait dog in a dog fighting club. 


When are we going to control our own schools? This whole ""community"" thing results in ""community"" coming together against us it seems. It's time for the aspie community to be separate in the areas where it's appropriate.


For your greatest aim to be getting accepted by the NTs is to say you'll only have meaning in life if people who hate us will give us a meaning in life. 


It's high time we start having stronger collective identity. Because the alternative is, we continue getting murdered, raped, abused, and pushed into suicide. 


The way people of some racial groups accuse you of being against them if you vote the wrong way, we need to normalize a narrative against NTs of the like ""if you don't support us having separate institutions then you must truly hate all the neurodivergent."" 


Every other group of people that was treated different, for being different, got it into their head they are different and should associate different. When will we?

The neurotypicals already identify us as different enough they feel justified in separating us from them. They're right. We are instantly identifiable as different and should associate with ourselves more close. No more seeking acceptance of them as the highest goal. They don't wanna accept us, get it through your head!",1

I thought things were going well. I was talking to someone in my family and we started talking about our days and what we wanted to do tomorrow. Then at one point I forgot to listen to the other person and started talking A LOT. Then it got to be so much that I interrupted them and they got visibly annoyed. “Okay I don’t care. STOP. LISTEN to what I’m saying.”

It felt like I got punched in the gut with a wave of shame. It was so bad. I apologized, excused myself, and cried in the restroom for half an hour afterwards. I felt like a total fool. I humiliated myself, interrupted someone, and they probably think I’m either a dumbass or rude. 

I got too excited and didn’t want to pause the conversation and forgot to take turns talking.

"I know masturbation is healthy but I dont want or like to do it. My therapist was shocked that i dont do it and i hate sex and relationships due to being bullied in school, i dont feel anything from masturbation as a woman, only boredom and I hate my self for that &#x200B;

it seems everyone else on here is hypersexual and stims from it, i even read about people mastrubating on public places or talking about it with their parents, each time my dad brought the topic up i screamed, disgusting. And that comes from a person who changes the diapers of my ill mother which has cancer and currently cant walk. Ive been hated by boys most of my life past 4th grade, feeling unwanted and being eww-ed at and being told i am disgusting, eventually my hygiene suffered so much and i started to smell and i never had problems washing ever in my life or washing my teeth, I was so depressed that i found it hard to move and being silent and suffering silently after reporting the abuse so much made me self harm. I struggle with everyone else on here describing in huge detail what they do with their organ or how it feels when i barely have any attraction to anyone and hate being touched. Guys made me feel small and weak or rejected and ignored me so why should i be attracted to anyone if they only like hoey mean sassy girls. I cant imagine having sex due to my severe hatred for physical touch but honestly hearing how it is a stress relief and everyone else feels pleasure while i am in constant pain, living in the past and trying not to oof my self makes me unhappy, as well as the fact that the most toxic and nasty people usually are in relationships. I hate how parents talk about it with their kids as if its something normal, I would probably run to another country than ever talk about sex, erotica brings me joy to read but what i like hypothetically/theoretically doesnt exist irl,

I do find anime guys attractive but that might be cause they wouldn't abuse and reject me, technically a lot of guys wouldnt either but i wouldnt find them attractive. I find most guys cringy and most guys want one thing, sex. Ive been called abnormal, crazy and many other words for simply denying sex or saying i look for a relationship. Even if the guy is normal he demands a lot of hugs and I hate how people see me as innocent sheltered virgin because i cant find a boyfriend. I dont understand relationships or how they start. But I was told I will die alone a lot which also makes me biased, i see it as a weird social milestone just like sex but i dont understand why is it important. I dont know how well I will do in a relationship since every girl and guy i know has had a few exes, some of which are druggies. I had my first kiss at a ""normal age"" but I get my driver's license at a much older age than appropriate cause i have to, the whole concept of virginity is weird to me because some guys sexualize me and want ""a pure woman"" even though they had 20 partners and probably have stds, just lieke the first guy to kiss me and give me herpes, not worth it cause he left me for dead and had a few girlfriends which made me never talk to him cause he did drugs and was creepy and annoying to me, whether i like someone or breathe i was made fun of so i dont know what type of guy would want me, a lot of people find me both annoying and boring and I am sometimes mute due to years of abuse and spend a lot of time alone. And sex is about communicatio nand boundaries, the other guys dont want an inexperienced woman that doesnt know what she wants and think i am a big red flag since where i live people date at 12-13 and i am about to end college with no experience at all which means I am abnormal and defective...when I see people in relationships i cant deduce what they have that i dont but they surely arent nice or smart, thats for sure.

Tinder/badoo is horribl but guys irl are just a bit less vulgar versions of what the guys there are. I know what I like but i just dont see it in my country and idk if i will want someone outside of my country, most guys randomly ask me about blowjobs, how many exes I had or talk to me for hours about each one of their exes on chat or on date and force me to listen, or tell me I am xrazy for not wanting sex or ask me if i ever had sex and when i say what kind of question is that they passive agressively say maybe not. I clearly stated in my bio that i dont look for sex and yet they clearly dont read or care, why is it so common guys to ask about sex so casually or talk about their ex, am I supposed to be nice with them and symparthize? Kind of an overreaction to insult a random girl cause she doesnt wan tto do it with you (I live in eastern europe, so) I feel really ashamed for my struggling social life and lack of romantic one, i think guys are creepy and out of all of the dates i went out with only 2 guys made me feel normal and didnt insult me or talk about their exes or sex or ask me if i like them after one hour convo.

 I know sex double standarts exist but you cant have 10 ex partners and expect a virgin girl, thats unrealistic, i am not abstinent or religious but i sometiems say i am because it is better than explaining asexual which makes people look at me as if I have 3 heads since lgbtq is really taboo where i live and i was called trans lesbian simply for not showing off my bra and being sassy mean type of girl, which most girls are, and i kinda stick out. If i am girly girl i just get sexual comments from older men but men my age clearly dont want me and i dont want them back because it is frustrating and scary to talk to the hostile and clearly ""rational"" male gender, i pretend to laugh at their jokes like a normal fake girl but i cant care. I never thought i had a type but it seems i like the same type of man in anime/korean manhwa and books and do have a strong preference, despite being 21 most guys are just boys who only want sex,nothing serious and are extremely immature and clearly arent ND which is horrible, i wont say marry me thats too early and a big commitment, and i know sex is big part of people's lives which scares me, the whole dead bedrooms and having sex on honeymoon and getting pregnant and giving birth is horrible and yucky to me, i honestly cant sympathize and hate that i must go through this so i can be ""a normal woman"" I know sex should be pleasureable but if it is anything like my masturbation, not feeling anything or boring i honestly would prefer to play games in my phone, i know sex makes you moan and all but porn makes me fall asleep, its like a weird moaning movie, id rather watch fantasy or comedy, and i do read a lot of erotica, idk why but most people portray sex as something horrible and i am biased due to my bullying and sensory issues, but in books and anime it is something intimate and beautiful, even though that sounds cringy i dont know how some people do it daily, id rather cut off my genitalia and die than have sex every day with a man, I struggle to imagine living with a man in general.

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. I thought og buying sex toys but living wiht my ill barely moving mother isnt really getting me into the mood, i do have sexy panties and clothes like latex and leather but they just help me not die and feel confident and not like the trash tumor my male classmates treated me as, i like the anime/book men that i like because i can be honest and feel like a woman when i watch them/read about them, with real men they are either creepy, immature, pervy (first pick up line in chat is - do you touch your self) also had a 50 year old man roam around my high school and asked me that at the age of 14 also where i live, so i stopped using the bus, and generally unpleasant to be around and those that are ""normal and social and attractive"" would never want an annoying boring weird girl like me, the constant jokes that i watch hentai and am kinky hurt me since in reality i look for security and pleasure since i have chronic pains and cry a lot but the other girls arent obsessed with sex becasue they already get it and have boyfriends so them liking anime/korean manga/erotic books and them trying it with their husbands deeply disturbs me but if i say that I am ""trying to control two consenting adults's behavior"" my emotions were never important and i spent most of my life being shouted at for ever having an opinion or expressing my emotions which left me mute, i still however think i am allowed to have an opinion and be my self and learn to be assertive. Ive been pushed and hit and had my things ruined and the teachers didnt care and sometimes it became worse, i never had a life where i felt safe and since it wasnt physical no one cared, so yeah I am allowed to take space ,and breathe oxygen especially since i dont hit or hurt or scream at anyone, but since this is the internet anyone can tell everyone else the most horrible things and feel like a winner, i dont think it is psychologically normal to read things not meant for you, but for horny single audience and try it wiht your partner, go try porn and masturbate together why dont you?

I strongly believe that there is no such thing as objective social skills. Aspies and NTs communicate differently and there is nothing inherently right or wrong about both.

"I just had my first ""fight"" with my girlfriend and it felt really terrible [rant] We've been together for 1,5 years now and this was the first time it happened. I use the word fight loosely as it was mostly just her being mad and berating me for several minutes straight while I sat there trying to understand what she was trying to tell me

We were having a movie night at her house and I was 5 minutes late to it as I was finishing up a board game session I was having with the boys (I double booked but managed anyway). Just a few minutes after our set time I texted her apologizing saying I was going to be a bit late as I was finishing up something. I didn't think much of it because both of us tend to be a little late to our meet ups every now and them. She texted me back saying she was sleepy and I again texted her apologizing and saying I would be there as fast as I can. She texted me again and we then texted a bit back and forth and she seemed like she didn't want to meet anyway that night and I became very unsure, she was being very vague and weird and I waited a while before going to her house because I honestly didn't know if she wanted me to come over or if she had changed her mind, and she didn't tell me. But after some back and forth I got an answer from her and she told me to come over.

When I came over she started berating me and especially hammering down the fact about how rude it is to be late to things etc. I said I was just 5 minutes late, but she said I was 20 minutes late, which was true, but that was because I thought she canceled our night so I wasn't sure. When I tried to explain this or ask questions to make sense of what she was saying and to make sure I understood her, she got even more mad and said things like ""You just don't understand, do you?"" and things like that, like she was belittling me. And I didn't know what to really do or make of the situation, I never fight or argue with people, I believe every problem can be solved peacefully, but she was having none of it. So I just kind of sat there and took it until she finished, not engaging in it at all, not even saying sorry or apologizing. It made me feel very vulnerable and embarrassed.

She said she wasn't mad at me, just mad, so mad she forgot the story she wanted to tell me. So I helped her jog her memory, and she told me about the story she wanted to tell and we had a normal conversation, even though she was still acting very moody. Then we we watched a movie, cuddled, flirted and had a nice normal chat before I went home a few hours later. She apologized to me for being mad and misunderstanding me and after I left she also texted me and apologizing for getting mad and misunderstanding. And I just told her it's okay and that I'm not mad or anything, even though I felt a bit hurt from the way she belittled me, but I don't know what else to really say.

Is this... normal? This is the first real relationship I've been in so it's quite new to me. She doesn't have autism, but I do and she knew that from when we first met. If this happens again should I just let her get it out? If I'm not mistaken I thing these things are emotional rather than a logical, so trying to be logical doesn't work",1
"I don’t want to be in a foreign country for almost 3 weeks. My husband wants to go visit his family in his home country for 18 days and I am terrified. Even being away from my home and routine for 5 days makes me feel horrible and anxious. I don’t want to. I tell my husband please can I only go for 1/2 of the time, and he won’t accept it. He gets extremely mad and tells me that I am being a bad wife basically. I try to tell him that I am not mentally like a ‘normal’ person, I want to be but I am not. He even gets mad at me mentioning that I am worried I will have no where to retreat and be alone while we are there with his family. 
I feel so misunderstood and unsupported by him all of the time. It makes me just not want to go at all. At this point I can tell he is not going to be an emotional support for me while we are there, so WHY would I put myself in that position???
Everytime he starts to ask me about the flights I voice my concerns and he gets mad and tells me I am preventing him from buying the tickets to visit his family. 
He wants me to just go along with it and act like everything is going to be great. I know that I’m going to have a ton of struggles because we went for 10 days in the past and it felt almost like torture to me. 
Coming back home I felt more drained from being in that foreign country than if I just worked my job like usual. Aren’t vacations supposed to refresh you? 
I have no one in my family or friends to talk to about it because they don’t understand how I could possibly be feeling any kind of fear or anxiety about going to a foreign country for this long. I feel so alone. 
Do any of you have advice for me. I need help. I don’t know what to do. 
I feel these are my options:

A. Act like it’s going to be fine and go for the entire trip with my husband and deal with whatever happens when it happens. 

B. Be firm and tell him I am only going for 1/2 the time (even this will be stressful but about 50% less stressful than the 18 days). 

C. Tell him I am not going at all. This will cause his family and him to be extremely upset but he is unsupportive whenever I mention the 1/2 duration idea. 

Thank you if you read this. My husband and I already have a lot and I mean A LOT of issues. Our marriage is not exactly on solid ground. I’m not only uncomfortable about the routine and environment change but I’m uncomfortable about having to be around his family who I feel is going to be judging me and treating me strangely.",1

"I need help understanding my feelings 37M High support Autism/Aspergers

I got diagnosed in 2011, my parents organised the diagnoses for me. Got a job shortly after, which I held for 8 years, got made redundant, got a new job 2 weeks later, have been at new job for 5 years.

I am perfectly happy in this job, I was not looking for another one, due to the fact that I hate change, and need essentially a same shit different day mentality/sense of routine to keep me focused, committed and calm.

I can't stress this enough I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB AT ALL!!!!

My mom surprises me out of nowhere, saying she has found the perfect job for me, potentially a lot more money (in reality probably not after taxes lets face it) it's in the public sector, which being that I am Australian, somehow means I can never be fired (don't know/understand how that works) and could potentially be a better environment for me. Plus it is in a field I am very familiar with and, not to brag, I am probably over qualified for.

However, I would be giving up every thing that I have built over the last 5 years to start all over again.

They include,

I have no helicopter monitoring, I can disappear for ages and no one comes looking for me.

I do all my tasks efficiently, well and properly.

I can wear whatever I want.

I leave on time, everyday and come in late and no one says shit.

I am fully autonomous, even in my team environment.

Even though there is no career progression i don't care about that.

It took ages, but my team, and the company understood my autism/asperger diagnoses and daily requirements, they respect it and leave me alone.

I just feel at the moment, like I am going to get this new position but to leave all the good I have at the moment and what I have built to essentially start all over again, is stressing me out. 

Especially when the decision wasn't mine to begin with, my mom suggested this to me, as something that is too good to not go for, an offer I can't refuse/give up, and I am the one that essentially has to pull the trigger on something that I NEVER WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!",1

"Is there any reason in particular why society hates certain traits that are exact symptoms of aspergers, while bpd, ocd and others can corelate to asperger it seems society hates certain traits in people in both men and women, I find dating to be horrible as a woman so I want to talk on a global scale since probably 9/10 of people here will be american but i want to talk about places like korea/japan where people with asperger are heavily hated, eastern europe which shames mental health and lgbtq and seems it as defective (where i am from) So like in my experience all of my life as a little girl (im sorry if this post should be on aspergirls instead but i wanted both male and female perspective) ive been told certain things - to not be part of the ""the crazy"" as we call them, usually people seem to refer to schizophrenia and other illnesses they are afraid of and dont understand but autist is actually a big heavy insult where i live. So is the mentally slow word starting with R which scares americans so much .I dont budge an eye since i hear it and other insults daily, not really aimed at me even though ive been told to die here and there. So basically there are certain milestones which everyone gets at certain age, like first kiss, first boyfriend, tattoos/piercings, driver's license which everyone gets at 18, I get it now at 21 since my father is dead and no one can drive my mum to the hospital, i also hate guys since no one on purpose from my class drove me to home so i had to freeze on bus stops and wait for a bus for at least 40 hours, since I am ""disgusting""

 and apperently being near me and breathing near me is a nuisance and I am horrible. I've been abused quite a lot in school which made me give up on education especially since i didnt get good grades in high school. I wasnt allowed to cry or be angry even when abused because that would fuel the abuse so i became mute but that made me even more depressed ot the point of self harm. I know the school shooter is popular trope in america but where i live it doesnt exist. I just knew one thing - Those ugly stinky forever alone men (I didnt know what asperger was or that it could exist in women when i was a child) that constantly watch anime and play video games...dont be one of them, dont befriend them, same with bullied people but idk why, i was the most bullied out of my both classes and kill me, shoot me, burn me , pay me money - i cant tell you why. First I was too girly and sissy in middle school and annoying and then in high school i was too quiet, weird, boring and anxious and the abuse grew since i was quiet but if i reacted or responded it wasnt better, and it was more verbal and social which ruined me mentally since middle school was more someone ruining my stuff. I hate being alone now and sitting alone since i am afraid i will be abused if i am 0.1 seconds alone.

...and i love my alone time. Lack of verbal conversatiosn and friends and constant criticism made me isolate my self and people....probably saw me as unferiendly. However i did the same to other groups and wasnt bullied. I clearly am not the problem but i do behaviors that i am not aware of that attract abuse. I was hit quite a lot by balls during pe and once in the girlschanging room so now i hate anything sports related, especially guys since it is guys that abused me. Why is bad hyigene/anime/video games so deeply related to asperger? Why is being alone and friendless being seen as miserable, i was never miserable being aloen, i was being miserable when someone shouted at me and touched me or hit me or humiliated me so the whole class laughed at me...i was also isolated and gossiped about so finding friends is hard, I do try to be friendly but since even my own mum gossiped on me i struggle to trust anyone since especially in school any info people had about me they used it against me, they were never curious, they just loved to make me cry and were cruel which is why i hate relationships and sex now. It seems many guys are lonely but no one talks about lonely girls since girls cant be lonely by default. No one sympathizes with girls problems since ""they can get sex"" easily but it doesnt mean we are happy. Ive been threateend on tinder and badoo by guys asking me where i live since i said that i am a virgin and dont want sex, and most guys have had sex in their teens and concider me abnormal. Ive been told i am disgusting by guys and eww-ed at and was seen as undesireablr and no one wanting to sit with me, talk to me

 be on a school trip with me which made me hate anything feminine and my self but the masculine didnt save me either, i was called trans, lesbian, shouted at when i smiled and it is still a wonder why i avoid eye contact and am mute. I never washed every day but my hyigene suffered as a result of the abuse and as you can guess everything is my fault and i am disgusting even whe ni wash with 3 shampoos and wear a perfume. Anything i did or liked was villanized while even loser guys who liked anime and video games prefered the mean girls, if i ever isulted back its like in their mind they confirm their bias that I am a horrible person that must die and was apperently ""a pick me"" for not being sassy mean girl that likes make up, i am much mroe girly now but it doesnt mean i get along or understand girls better and i dont want it to seem like the bullying won and made me ""normal"" aka not tomboy. I dont want ot be submissive wife type but i hate the loud mean girls so i am trying to find my own voice which was taken away from me, i found it hard to breathe in school and couldnt concentrate on my studies unlike i nmiddle school where the abuse was more different and i could awkwardly laugh even when hit, but in high school i started caring too much, couldnt stop, cried a lot due to hormonal disbalance and couldnt leave my house in fear of being bullied, i struggle to ""ignore "" words or actions

 once said and if i do they usually escalate even if i report them, i was somehow seen as a spineless toy to toy around with even when i was sviicdial and self harmed but if i did something drastic i wouldnt have had support and would have been kicked out and have had problems, so i cojstantly said in cold tone, i dont care/go away because i couldnt care less and everything inside my body burnt and hurt and i couldnt eat, sleep or breathe, my face was yellow. They ruined my life and werent even punished and the damned conceler told me and my parents that i should move on, i dont know if ishould have talked to the principial since the guys that bullied me didnt see me as a human, let alone a woman since i wasnt mean and had friends. It seems iti okay to be quiet if you have friends, there was this guy paet of the video game gang that never talked but no one bullied him, but since i am alone somehow my behavior ""sticks out"" and it is unaccapatable. Ironically when i tried to talk I was ignored or told to shut up, most of the time and my bullies constantly tried to ruin my day in small ways, even on our prom and last day with our teacher the guys foguht to not sit near me or be near me which made me cry, because it is psychologically abnormal at the old age of 18 to fight to not be near a girl, guys do that at 8-9 age cause girls have ""cooties"" but the age where everone has lovers and likes each other, being disliked platonically and romantically and people not wanting anytihng to do with you and having this weird opinion that you are disgusting without any evidence...that hurts. Ive never smelled or went to school badly looking to deserve such a bad nickname, which i had even in middle school but it made me stop washing my teeth to the point whee i had many cavities and smelled a lot. Idk if these boys are sissy but having big muscles and abusing little girls with anorexia doesnt make you manly, i clearly couldnt hit back physically with a ball let alone verbally with words so fighting a girl as a gang of guys is bizzare, guys show strength and status by fighting each other.

...fighting a girl indirectly is ....kinda weak. I dont like guys and see relationships and sex as negative because of them, and yet I am the ""loser"" for being a virgin and not having dating experience and being seen as a red flag despite being a woman cause society says so. Guys only talk about blowjobs and how many exes they had or they ask me how many exes i had, i went to many dates but about 2 guys only treated me good and listened to me in convo, idk how or why is it normal, one guy even told me he looks for replacement for his ex and not a real gf, but 9/10 guys just want sex, friends with benefits, one night stands and call me crazy since how can i dare to deny them.  I dont feel safe with guys since the topic of sex always comes on and the lgbtq is heavily stigmatized so using the word asexual or saying i have asperger is off the table, since i will be part of the crazy. I also hope i wouldnt be registered somewhere since if you have mental illness similar to shciozoprenia you cant drive a car, adopt a child, etc and jobs dont really accept you. Similar ot how i dont say i have a mother wiht cancer that cant walk or else i wont be hired, so people saying - i am glad i am not in OP's country make me livid.  I know hygiene is basic and normal but i am tired of ever sharing my abuse be seen as whining while others whine about lack of wifi/fake nails/homework.

No one cares and i wont share but if i never share anything about my self i am seen as suspicious and people treat me badly. Ive read a lot of self help books and a lot or articles on how to better my social skills but it seems it is not me who has bad social skills, you cant be offended that i dont look you in the eye for 0.3 seconds and call me rude. And this whole ""you're weird thing"" I wish people told me what makes me so much weird so i can erase it since it creates problems in my relationships and makes people wary of me, all i know is that i smile and am polite and should be more assertive since it somehow translates to - come abuse me, i am defensless !- idk why, so i am also cold amd emotionless and it seems to do the job of ""assertiveness"" or whatever, quite well. I used to be big on empathy but if i find it hard to sympathize with anyone right now and life is a bit easier this way. I also struggle when i read posts from guys on here and i have one good friend from new york whose brother has some form of autism and she was very offended that i told her that he is usleess since he cant work...well she mentioned that all women should burn in hell because they dont want to suck him, so there is that. I also know a guy wiht severe autism which hits his parents and siblings and screams and pisses him self and as 8 year old i couldnt explain what was wrong with him so i hated him...the other boys dont hit me, so why does he? I made a post about the guy a long time ago and peoople just hated me in the comments and wished me i have children with autism. I didnt know what autism was but i ust knew that he had it and it must relate to physical abuse, i didnt even know someon with autism could talk, how can i not hate him? I read a lot and it seems there are many similiarites among girls with asperger and me, but it seems guys with autism dont really act like the guy that i know that beats other people up which is helpful information. I know america has these awareness weeks/days but where i live such things are strictly taboo and not talked about, we barely talk about periods and sex, let alone mental health and lgbtq. 

&#x200B;

It seems every group that is hated, furries, 4chan/redditors, anime fanatics/weebs tthe type that have bodypillows, video game maniacs that dont leave chair and have virtual waifus, fujoshis - they all seem to connect back to asperger and i want to ask - why do people hate them so much, not everyone can be ""cool"" and change their girlfriend/boyfriend every year, not everyone can have abs/big breasts and always say the right thing and not be neurotic, so why hate and entire group of people and their traits and villanize them as if they have cancer. Everything ive been told from a young age not to be, anime fan, video game fan, forever alone perso nthat doenst wash - ibecame, and those people are the most hated, as far as I know even p3dos that are chased dont get so much bad rep or at least arent talked about as the local weird person in everyone's group that no one likes and excluded and makes fun of because apperently roasting someone especially in school is an important skill and so is conformism to the point where you are never your self and being loud and mean and somehow having friends and not losing them, its a mystety to me why i have friends and lose them, usualy they change cities or schools but sometimes they leave me and i dont know why, its ""clear"" but if i ask i am just stared at, so i avoid verbal conversations which makes me even more weird and ""anti social"" (asocial) in people's eyes, but when I try to speak I am told to shut up, when I smile i am screamed at why do i smile but if i dont i get called depressed and other words. While hygieen is important it seems people dont hate so much anime as they hate the people, ive had anime guy fans in my class and no one bullied them is it because they smoked like many other people or is it social skills or something else that i miss? I like how people feel judged by you or just simply dislike you and excuse their physical and verbal abuse by pushing you and telling you to die and thart you are weird but you cant even scream and protest and you must endure years of abuse since they get a kick by kicking people out and reporting doesnt work and you deserve to get education as much as everyone else but apperently arent allowed to exist, because a gorup of people think you are lame, annoying, boring and weird which means you should go. Its kinda weird because cheating or not they got better grades than me and i was a nerd...so why hate me for studying, i mean you got what you want right? You also party and have friends so why hate on me for not having what you have? Its like i wasnt even seen as a human let alone a woman, and there is only one way to be a woman - heterosexual, feminine, mean, sassy. I was just not that therefore i dont deserve respect, many think i am weird but some just avoid me which is why bullying is so bizzare, some stopped bullying me but it didnt feel like  a win it felt more like pity which i hate",1

"I’ve lost my ability to mask and I’m trying to get it back! As a young kid and teenager my way of masking was to barely speak and go with the flow to not draw attention to myself. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it failed. 

As a 31 year old I’ve lost this ability. I can’t always go with the flow. I can’t be timid and meek to get by, adults expect other adults to talk and interact in more complex ways with them. Short “yes” and “no”s don’t satisfy people anymore.

Now it’s like I CAN’T mask worth a shit anymore. I don’t know what to say, where to stand, how to make proper eye contact without making things weird, or how to hold a conversation that doesn’t immediately end.

Idk how to get this ability back. I never really honed it all too well to begin with, but it’s especially hard to get away with odd social behaviors as an adult!",1

"Are there any well-summarized and actionable books specifically for individuals with ""high-functioning"" autism? I consider myself a very long-term focused and patient person but even someone like me is feeling defeated. I just want a book that goes like ""how to succeed in life with specifically high-functioning autism"". With thorough career, business, social, communication, dating, community etc. advice.

I've developed a mask desperately through my childhood and I'm 25 now. It takes interacting with me in an uncontrolled setting for 5-10 minutes to tell that ""something"" is ""off"". In a controlled setting, I can hide it for days to weeks, or minimize it over months. I always end up ""unmasked"" eventually.

Therapy has been a crap shoot. If anything, therapy is the prime environment for masking. It's a one-on-one controlled setting. It couldn't be easier besides some anxiety or over eagerness to share. Also, every resource I look into is for someone with full-blown autism or for people who are neurotypical.

I need a new system. Something I can adopt to adapt to my circumstances. When I read a book or look for advice and it tells me to ""just be social"" or ""get therapy"" I don't even feel annoyed anymore. I just laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Living with this as an adult is honestly like a fever dream.

I can force myself to cope with eventually living alone, working remotely and making just barely six figures, and then dying alone. It won't be easy but that's a very REAL possibly and if I have no choice, I'll ruthlessly accept it and take it one challenge at a time.

BUT, I want MORE for myself. I want to advance in my career and salary, I want to make those moves, I want to have a healthy support system in the long-run and as I reach old age, I want to challenge myself by addressing what IS within my control to live a very long and healthy life.

I need to get this figured out ASAP. Even if I'm fucking crawling on the floor and everyone else is walking. I will fucking crawl my way to where I want in life. But I need to learn the best way to crawl.",1

"Hate Sudden Schedules I don't know why I hate it so much but I just can't stand something being scheduled or asked to be scheduled with almost no notice. Like when it comes to friends, if a friend asks if I want to hang out with them that day or the next day, I will almost always say no or if I am forced into it I will be in an annoyed mood the entire time but if we planned on hanging out a few days later then I am completely fine with it. Same applies to work, like if I am asked to come in the next day for overtime or I am called that day to work a shift I don't work then I always say no but if extra shifts were scheduled I would be fine with it.

I do hate feeling like this because it makes my friendships and other daily occurrences awkward. Like if something takes the whole day up that is what I get annoyed about but if I was suddenly asked if I wanted to go out just for lunch or something that takes like 1-2 hours then I am completely fine with it.

"(Usually) Poor recollection. At age 30, I still can't discern what is happening with my memory. Officially diagnosed with ASD only two years ago, so still learning about how I work.I work in the design field, and love to work alone, but in order to expand my prospects and onboard clients, the people in the position I'm looking to move towards are great talkers. I did a music degree so I can perform publicly, my issue is I forget what I know. It doesn't matter how many podcasts or interviews I listen to on design, architecture, history, manufacturing processes etc  and read and re-read the books, the moment I try to explain anything, my mind goes to mush.Same if explaining the plot to a movie - even one I only just saw.I'm 99% sure I don't have a brain injury (not that I can prove anything either way) I think its just a quirk of how my brain works.

Example:

My partner of two years (40s) has a complex job role, and we both usually work from home (and we love to work in the same room together). I couldn't count the hours of talking about his job, the intricacies, and all the business calls that have happened in my presence (and I ask a lot to understand), but if you asked, I couldn't give you more than a sentence on what he does. He got his PhD >15 years ago, and from several IQ tests I did in my younger years scored around the mid 130s. We talk and think very much alike. But because of my poor recall, I think people who don't know me won't understand what I'm trying to say (or give me a chance).

I'm concerned that my credibility will look weak. I look around and its like people have an incredible script, going on sometimes for hours on a topic. My entire life revolves around design, almost all my thinking and 'spare' times goes to it, but I can't talk about it.

A big week-long design convention is coming up one week from now, and there are a few people I would really like to work with/for and I'm concerned I'll look like an idiot when talking to them despite my capabilities (I can hardly flap my work in their face, so talking about it is usually how people ""network"" - another mysterious social dance I don't know the steps to).

"Feeling Life is Pointless because of AI Idk if this belongs here but I have to vent.

I’ve never been able to communicate or understand people due to my Aspergers/ASD, but I’ve always felt that at least the arts can allow me to understand others at least in some way.

But now the rise of AI in creative fields makes me want to give up. For all the supposed benefits it has for ‘streamlining’ and ‘democratizing’ art, all it seems to me to be doing is ridding art of that pesky human element. Especially in our current, worthless capitalist hellhole of a world, where everything looses its human value to the whims of economic inputs and outputs, I have no doubt that very soon the majority of commercially available art will be dominated by non-human entities. And soon we’ll reach a point when, even if an individual person creates a beautiful piece or invents a new style, that style will simply be replicated almost instantaneously and dilute whatever feelings one my have for the thing beyond a algorithmic dopamine tick.

The world (or at least the United States) is already so difficult to survive in economically that pursuing art is already a stupid risk few can entertain, let alone actually pursue. Now there’s even less chance a person can survive making art because a machine will produce infinitely more ‘content’ (a word I despise with every fiber of my fucking being) in any style imaginable. I don’t even doubt that, in a generation or two, art as a thing humans pursue for pleasure will be seen as old fashioned, at least in traditional/non-digital forms; the idea that people will continue using traditional ways feels naïve to me, considering humans almost always default to the path of least resistance. Painting, for example, will be a thing a person considers doing for 5 minutes. They’ll download an app, generate something that’d make Van Gogh jealous, and then get bored. 

And now I feel so lost and alone. It feels like my one real window into people’s souls has been stolen from me. Art is communicative and interpersonal, or at least it was until now. Now I’ll always look art with a little suspicion. Whatever emotional or intellectual connection I may make form with the artist will never feel as strong now. I hate this.

I don’t care if it sounds hyperbolic. Life feels truly worthless to me now. What even is the goddamn point.",1

The problem is that this affects socializing, because people see this girl with headphones on and think it’s impolite or that I’m listening to music while talking, but I’m not.

I am struggling with my unique interest. Can anyone relate or offer me advice. So I have a rly hard w my unique interest. They change so much and so often.

Does anyone have any experience with this and does anyone have any advice as to what I should do. I really wish I could be one of those aspies that just super interested in one thing and that was it. I feel like things would be simpler for me. I just want to know how I can over come this because it’s honestly very debilitating.,1

"A couple executive functioning questions to help my husband… Hi! My husband has Aspergers. He is an amazing person! His mood (also has bipolar) and ability to handle life is heavily affected by how much sleep he gets. He really struggles to take his meds and go to bed at a healthy, consistent time. He is normally twitch streaming but can definitely (and I think this is what he means to do) just do it/play computer game for an hour rather than two or more. Sometimes, he’s stopped and is doing other things. He has an alarm that goes off but will often turn it off without getting up to take his meds.
He also doesn’t take care of other things in a timely manner which often ends up causing us problems (like bills) or he’ll then feel like he has to do them (like dishes) before bed which puts him to bed too late even though he could have done it earlier.
Any tips? Thanks 🙏

Date ordered: November 3, 2022

Date completed: February 2, 2023

On February 2, 2023, the Registrant appeared before a panel of the Inquiries, Complaints and Reports Committee (the Panel) to be cautioned with respect to their compliance with the Standards of Practice for Dual Registration, Consent, Record Keeping, Advertising, and Communicating a Diagnosis.

The Panel reminded the Registrant that it is their responsibility to ensure that the patient understands the professional status of the service provider and clarifies the professional capacity they are acting in when providing services. The Panel informed the Registrant that they are required to clearly distinguish and identify their professional status in their patient records, in addition to documenting that a consent discussion took place.

The Panel reiterated to the Registrant that the College’s Standard of Practice for Communicating a Diagnosis requires that a registrant performs the act within the context of a naturopath–patient relationship and that they review the diagnosis with the patient.

The Panel expressed its concern with the Registrant’s online presence, specifically noting that it may have lacked transparency and have been confusing to some members of the public who are not familiar with professional designations and qualifications. The Panel impressed upon the Registrant that all advertising is to be comprehensible to its intended audience.",1

"Culture shock and autism What are your experiences of living abroad or traveling and going through the frustration stage of culture shock? I don't only mean in cultures that are very different to your own (as culture shock can happen in another culture and be more subtle.)

I find that after the honeymoon phase of culture shock, I get pretty annoyed and frustrated by little differences and I stay annoyed- rather, the things I love about the culture that are different and the things that are annoying exist at the same time, in every moment. But, if I focus on my annoyance, it doesn't help. Also, people from that culture don't notice the thing, can't empathise, or get defensive, of course :)

"Feel like giving up work - please help 
I have a fairly successful career and objectively am doing well, but it is not without its struggles. I have listed these below for ease, and if any readers relate or can offer guidance on how to overcome it would be much appreciated: 

1. I find myself consistently in situations that are out of my comfort zone such as public speaking, which I have to prepare for and know every single detail about on the subject matter beforehand in order to confidently be able to deliver. This, combined with the act of doing it, is exhausting both mentally and physically. I’m not typically somebody who rocks as a stim but I found myself recently doing this before a public speaking event. I suspect the more experienced I become the less taxing this would be. My main reason for the anxiety is not knowing how to phrase a sentence or position a message which I think is due to autism. 
2. Relationship issues: I haven’t had major issues with this is the past but over the last 12 months have been managed by someone who evidently does’t like me and misunderstands me/my character. I don’t know whether they feel threatened by my (perceived) confidence or actually think I’m rubbish. Some further context, my boss’ boss thinks highly of me and values my difference in thinking and boss knows that. I know I’m good at my job but not being able to get answers to questions in a timely manner from boss really affects how effective I can be. This has knocked my confidence as I have also gone a long period without any positive reinforcement. I tried to give feedback in a constructive way and it went really badly. 
Considering a study found that having a bad manager is on par with having a bad marriage, even for NTs, this experience has been really difficult to handle. That being said, I’ve caused minimal collateral damage from the internal rage considering how bad I feel; except 
3. Said boss has done as much as possible to tarnish my name through either direct comments or the use of semantics, which can be very impactful (probably more so than comments imo).  Some colleagues probably already think I’m a bit odd as I don’t follow the crowd and occasionally offer a differing viewpoint to the status quo. I check myself when doing so however due to my cognitive differences, I still don’t always get it right. 

I have requested a new boss under the veil of a different project I’ll be working on, without fully stating my reasons for the request. I have allude to some of the issues I’ve been having but a watered down, palatable version cognisant of my stronger ND emotions. 

The issues I’m facing have made me feel burned out and impacted my self-esteem, and I’m reassessing whether I’m cut out for the life of leadership, even though others have seen this potential in me. If anyone can relate or able to advise how they overcame similar situations it would be much appreciated 🫶🏻

Posting in here as I know my fellow NDs will understand and be able to advise according to our neurology and cognitive differences. I have NTs that would try to help but I don’t think their advice would help in this situation.",1

Has a parent, relative or peer ever made you feel inadequate or undesirable due to a lack of professional or academic achievement on your part?

Those with ASD, well everything is harder: academics, social skills and career skills. Nobody wants the deck stacked against them but sadly this is the case for many with ASD.

Have you ever been made to feel dirty/unimportant based on your lack of acheivment and ability? The sort of situation where a parent/ peer doesn’t hate what you do, more just sort of hates the totality of you? Do you think it’s right to have love/ acceptance conditioned on talent and success?

"From a comfortable introvert to the extroverted and socially anxious aspies out there. Just want to send you some love.

If I have any skills or attributes, navigating social mazes and solving social riddles are not amongst them. Fluid communication is neither predictable nor intuitive. Naturally, this has placed tremendous restrictions on my ability to develop and maintain friendships, as well as attaining social cachet. 

However, as socialising and status are not a priorities of mine, the above is not an issue for me. I am perfectly content in my own company, I very seldom, if ever, feel lonely, and I am completely at ease talking to strangers and acquaintances as and when it is necessary. My neurological wiring and their effects on my social ability is not something which causes anxiety. 

I am incredibly lucky that I am a comfortable introvert. I am also incredibly lucky that I am unaffected by engaging with others when necessary while also having the confidence to disengage at my own whims without any sense of guilt or shame. 

I cannot even imagine how difficult I would find life if I longed for what would be considerable endeavour, let alone being of a nervous disposition in the first place. 

My motivation for this post is unclear to myself really. While I can definitely emphasise with finding social interaction to be an irrational and frustrating conundrum, I cannot pretend that I am all too troubled by same. Beyond a throwaway comment along the lines of *""have you looked into Stoicism/Buddhism/Absurdism?""* I am not especially inclined or qualified to give any meaningful advise either.

If every aspie went on strike and chose to only share his or her inventions and discoveries among a community of other neurodivergents, the world would eventually eat its own.

"When is it considered meddling? Hoping to get some insight. 

A little about me. I have a BA in psychology, focused in child and social psychology. I did an internship with children on the spectrum way back in the day. and my nephew is autistic. 

I just started leading a girl scout troop and one of my girls is clearly on the spectrum. Her parents had her join the troop in effort to help her make friends since she doesn’t really have any. At the same time I don’t think they have any clue that she is on the spectrum. 

Do I mention it? Or just give her the space she needs to participate to the fullest of her ability? She is no trouble at all for the troop, and I am perfectly capable of integrating her.

"Is there any out for a short asian guy with asperger? 


Hi. I'm a 5'7 21M asian dude who has been clinically diagnosed as having asperger syndrome. It's not like I'm totally autistic. I'm high functional, but my social ability is still bad enough that I have with some social interactions and maintaining friendships (basically, in every school or classroom, they'll be *that guy.* I'm *that guy*). You can forget my women skills because I am way below the level of even considering that stage. I found that others think I'm a very boring person, that I always seem so dull and uninterested all the time even though I never felt that way.

When I was younger, I was quite tall since I have an early growth spurt. Although I was socially awkward, some girls find me 'cute' and acted so, so I may attribute that to my height at that time. Since then, I've rarely grown and all my friends ended up being all taller than me. 

In getting attention from girls, because I'm socially awkward, I felt that at least if I was tall I at least could use that factor to compensate. Now that I'm short, I found most short men compensate by being social and charismatic, but that is not possible for me, or at least insanely difficult because I never managed to make a full breakthrough before. Yes, there was a period when I lost a decent chunk of weight and became more confident and made more friends, but that friendship never lasts for some reason and in the end, I ended up becoming invisible again anyway.",1

I've moved to a less crowded space in the building, disabled all the lights, and acquired noise-canceling headphones. Managed to get around IT blocking extra software so I found means to pass the time. People don't try and small talk with me as much in comparison to a year ago.

Yet it's the second week of that and I feel like my soul is being drained. I feel like an animal in an open field during the hunting season. The headphones and music are sometimes not enough and I don't want to crank the volume not to hurt my ears. The other light sources and motions in the corners of my sight. I have means of passing the time but I'd get in trouble if someone found out.

No changing jobs for me any time soon either sadly. It's hard to find a good job for visually impaired people and I do like what I am doing - I just hate the baggage that comes with working on-site. 

Do you peeps maybe have any tips on how to deal with this? Make the office days more bearable?",1
"I had to explain to someone why people with Asperger’s dislike pointless small talk (in my experience anyway) I dislike small talk, due to it feeling unnecessary, I don’t need to be talking constantly over things that aren’t productive all the time, and it seems like if I don’t I’m “anti social” or whatever people say behind me at school

So I described it like this.

Picture you went to a town, not for a particular reason, but you did, and everyone there rapidly pats their heads as they walk, this doesn’t serve any purpose, but people do it, and you are outcasted if you don’t

You don’t see the point of this, and it just gets aggravating that you have to keep patting your head for no actual purpose. But to blend in you have to do it. Otherwise you’re alienated.

Hope this made some sense",1
"Does anyone else hate conflict even when it comes to stuff in shows, movies, etc? I don't know if this is necessarily an autism thing, but I'm posting it here because I do feel like for me part of it comes from a sensitive nervous system (from autism) so thought others might relate

A lot of the time I feel uncomfortable and stressed just from conflict or things turning bad even in shows and movies. Or even just when things get more complicated in shows.

Like for example, with Breaking Bad... Obviously the first season isn't sunshine and rainbows, and there are plenty of problems. But it's like as the seasons go on and things get more and more tangled, and the show introduces more conflicts than just the main one, it stresses some part of my brain out. Chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer, cooking meth in an RV (plus the couple of deaths in season 1)? Yeah, not exactly a positive show, but, ya know. It still has less of a negative vibe than the later seasons, there's humor sometimes. Then as the seasons go on and more people start dying, there starts being more conflict in Walt's family, the whole thing with Tuco and then Gus where Walt and Jesse's lives are in danger a lot of the time... The show's still great, don't get me wrong, but it stresses me out in a way.

 My brain's blanking on other specific examples, but it's always been like this for me with shows. You know when a show goes half a season, a season or 2 of being calmer or at least kind of just a consistent basic storyline, and then they've got to introduce conflict and things to switch it up? Like shows where people start dying, things like that. I get that it would be boring if there was no conflict and nothing changed obviously, but it's like it sets off the overly sensitive part of my brain and makes me want things to just stay calmer and more consistent. It's also why a lot of the time I just avoid action-y shows or movies, even if they sound interesting.

"My husband feels alone being married to me My husband of six years randomly turned to me and said it's lonely being married to an autistic person. He was sad because his family lives far away and he was missing them. I didn't know he wanted comfort. Whenever I feel bad I want people to leave me alone so I do the same for people. It turns out to be the wrong thing a lot. My ex boyfriend called me cold and my friends called me distant. This is mostly because I don't show emotions much and I don't hug. I might be asexual, I don't like physical touch from people I'm not intimate with, and am not good at knowing what to say to make people feel better, especially if I have to lie to do it. I calmly suggested that maybe my husband needs someone who's not autistic but that makes him even sadder. How do I, at 30, learn to be supportive? Everyone in my family is stoic and we were punished for not being that way. I feel like I have to lie and be disingenuous to seem caring...",1
"How do I tell if my friends are ignoring me? Possibly trying to phase me out? I have gone through this so many times before you would think I would have it down, but I don’t. I have come to the realization that my friends, my 2 closest friends, don’t respond a lot of the time when I text them. A lot of the times my messages where I send memes or talk about my special interests or anything like that go ignored. It didn’t used to be like this. We used to all talk. I have known one of these friends since high school. None of us are married and we all planned on moving in together but now I just don’t know. My mind keeps telling me that they are annoying by me every time I text them as most of the time they don’t respond. At first I thought it was them just needing time to respond but like, this would also be on days I knew they were off and we were conversations just fine. I would somehow just kill the conversation and they wouldn’t reply to me anymore. They know I’m on the spectrum and any awkwardness isn’t intentional but like, I have been abandoned and left alone so many times that I begin to shift toward those thoughts pretty easy. I then tried to change the way I would text as I was told some people don’t feel the need to respond if it isn’t in the form of a question. So I did that. Started framing my texts as a question. Like I still info dump every now and again when I get excited but like, when it’s met with nothing it really fucking hurts. They know I have been dealing with being ignored and feeling extremely lonely but this happens anyway. I barely get invited anywhere anymore too. Most of the time I am the one making plans and now I feel like they are just tolerating me. I just don’t know how to tell if they are ignoring me on purpose or not.",1

"Anyone here lose skills due to ""burnout""? I am really struggling to find my way back to how I was. I had a stressful living situation with neighbors and I moved, but I think the moving process is what killed me. Any time my crazy neighbors went away like on vacation, I felt like myself again, and I assumed when I moved into a new home I'd just go right back to how I always was but that's not the case.

The buying process, moving process, and dealing with settling in and fixing up a new house seems to have destroyed me, even though I've done it before. Things are ""back to normal"" as in nothing stressful at my house, but I find myself wasting my days. I don't do anything I used to do. I never went back to how I was before I had crazy neighbors.

Although just an example of a little thing, I used to do my nails on a certain day of the week which should be an easy thing (a huge sensory issue for me is my nails growing, I trim and paint them once a week- or I used to. Now I let it go for weeks... it's awful.) and general keeping up of things is very difficult. I do laundry ok, I shower every day, but it's like beyond that I don't have the willpower. I just focus on my job which I do at home, but even so some times I'm slacking lately. But only because I'm trying to figure myself out. I used to be so much more on top of everything and felt like my life was in order. This doesn't include my creative endeavors which was basically my identity. Also not running errands like I used to, waiting until the last minute or not doing things at all.

Can anyone relate to this? Did your life change drastically and you were never the same? I used to clean my car once a week too, I stopped. Its an absolute mess now. I stopped doing so many things.

But what's funny is I \*used\* to be the way I've become now. Over the years, especially when I lived alone for a period of time, I gained skills and habits. Mostly out of my own loneliness. But I kept them up once I got into a relationship again. I had my habits. Prior to that, a prior relationship with a toxic person who expected me to be someone else I did learn a lot of skills. Also from college. And it helped me function even if part of it wasn't due to the right reasons, and they're all gone now.

I feel like a shell of who I was. Right now I'm trying to work on my creative endeavors for 1 hour a day, which I didn't do at all yesterday. And trying to do my nails once a week on the day of the week I always used to do them except I think I'm going to miss it at this rate. I mention the nails thing again because that was just so simple and I feel it still is, or should be, but it isn't anymore.

I am worried I will never go back to how I used to be. I just used to be more on top of everything. I used to make art and submit it places like to local shows. I can't even imagine my brain being able to deal with that. Did I really die? Will I ever be the way I was? I want to know if anyone else lost everything in ""burnout"". It feels like that's not even the right word but it is. I am a shell of who I was, I basically live and do nothing. ",1
"today was not my day hey! good night. i'm a 19 year old boy (ftm), diagnosed at 11 but found out at 17. after that moment in my life, everything started to feel better, because i was learning about myself and understanding why i am like this. of course it wasn't easy, but at least i accepted who i am and stopped feeling guilty about things that weren't my fault (like my personality).

but now i'm looking for some advice (and i need to vent, too). because throughout my life, beyond the social difficulties, my biggest drawback and limitation has been anxiety. anxiety has been with me since childhood, causing me physical and emotional discomfort, one that prevents me from eating and, in turn, causes me to vomit numerous times (even if i have nothing in my stomach); and it's a vicious circle, because my anxiety inhibits me from eating, but at the same time i stop eating because I fear vomiting in public. and this last thing happened every time i had a class presentation, or a new school year started, or i had different experiences, but as the years progressed and when i entered the university, it became more of a habit when i had to go to study, since every time, i stopped eating from the day before due to my uncertainty. it was difficult for me to sleep and when i woke up, i spent my first or last minutes before leaving the house vomiting, which not only hurt me physically, but also emotionally, so when i was in college, it was like being there with just my body and not with my mind.

it's difficult, because every time it happens, i can only think: ""it happened again""; and again, and again, and i just get frustrated and ashamed, not understanding why even if i try breathing exercises, anxiety relief techniques, thinking different thoughts, the result is always the same. it hurts to live like this.

the intensity of my anxiety increased in the past year. i lost weight, i isolated myself, i was with people who were not very good for me and that led my parents to recognize the magnitude of the situation. so today i went to see a psychologist, who treated me during childhood. however, at the end of the hour and after telling him how i felt (exactly what i wrote before and a couple of other things), it seemed to me that i remained in the same place and i did not receive any answer to my doubts, plus the worst thing was the fact that, after hearing psychologist's opinions about the lgbt community, non-binary people, and that biologically men were more likely to be unfaithful because they could have sex with women without loving them (which i genuinely disagree with, because in my opinion it's more a matter of values and respect, and is not related to biological factors or should be justified with them).

obviously i was upset and that caused me to be irritated and argue with him, although it was not the reason for the consultation and i know that i should not judge him by his opinions but by his work performance. ...although being part of the lgbt (and trans) community, i couldn't not take it personally.

and at the end there was another moment of tension after asking him if he thought I needed medication, where he told me in a stronger tone that psychotherapy was not an obligation and the decision to do it was mine. that if i did not have the disposition, he could only refer me to a neurologist. that there were no good or bad decisions, and something like that in five years or more, i would see the results of it. i don't quite understand what he meant at the end, or if it had to do with the fact that i could regret it. it was weird.

and i know perfectly well that i let my ideals interfere, but i don't know how to feel comfortable when i don't trust or tolerate the person who can help me. maybe it's several things and it's just that i also felt disappointed, sort of sad, to think that he didn't take seriously how i felt about my anxiety. you know, like someone is always worse off and mine isn't that serious, even though it's not a competition when someone feels bad.

even so, the psychologist assigned me an appointment for the next week, but i really don't want to go and force myself to be with him, especially when consultations are expensive in my country (i live in venezuela) and getting money is difficult for my parents. i would prefer to go to a neurologist, start a treatment (which is not cheap either) and try to move forward... but i would like to know the opinion of someone else. i feel very overwhelmed with what happened today.",1
"Too NT to get along with other ND’s. Too ND to get along with other NT’s. Anyone else feel like this? Like your just balancing in the middle of being neurotypical and being neurodivergent?

She has autism and she’s friendly and all that but we just don’t click? It’s the same with other autistic people I’ve been forced to talk to. I just feel I’m too “normal” to talk to them.

But then with neurotypical people, I just can’t talk to them. I’ve tried but they just look at me with pity in their eyes, like “oh this poor person, I’ll just talk to them to make them feel less bad about having to deal with their own stupidity for the rest of their life.” Or they flat out make fun of me.

Why is talking on the phone so stressful? What are some tips for not being anxious of talking on the phone for people with an autism neurotype? ,1
"How different would someone be if they weren't autistic/neurodivergent? I know getting caught up wondering what if isn't healthy, but at the same time I can't help but be curious. Especially with my recent ADHD(moderate Combined-type)diagnosis which further explains things than simply being autistic(procrastination, distractibility, internal restlessness, etc). My school years were basically defined by a lack of social/academic success especially in my adolescence. I am nearly 23 and still don't have a degree, and am basically starting over from scratch anyway. My goal is to be a police officer, but with scattered work history and lots of withdrawn classes it will be a couple of years before I try and apply. I am still working on expanding my interests to include more mainstream things(music, shows,etc) though I am a nerd at heart. 

That being said, this is something I came across in a different post:

>Being autistic doesn't fundamentally change a person (let me explain). Mean NT's would be mean autistic people, nice NT's will be nice autistic people. Autism is more of an intensifier of existing traits with a grab bag of fun disabling features thrown in (hand flapping, social dysfunction, self harm, stimming, ect). 

I plan on asking my psychiatrist more about this later in the month during my medication follow up, but this doesn't seem inaccurate. Like despite my social ineptitude leading to some cringey moments of inappropriate(albeit unintentional behavior), I have been told I am a kind person at heart(family, teachers, acquaintances) and described as mild mannered as well. Plus nowadays lots of ''normies'' are into nerdy aspects of pop culture to a degree. Including superhero films/shows, nostalgia based cartoon shows, and as a black guy who is atypical compared to stereotypes, plenty of other black guys dig anime. Michael B Jordan is an open otaku for example.

All this to say is while I wish I was farther along in terms of life goals and a better childhood(dysfunctional family aside) I don't dislike my basic personality, nor do I think it would be radically different. I don't mind being a tall black guy who isn't into basketball or isn't into vulgar rap. Not that I don't have personal flows, but I most likely wouldn't magically be an asshole without my conditions. My interests would be the same most likely, and I would actually be better at them without the executive function/hyperfixation causing me to stumble and kicking the can down the road so to speak(style hopping in martial arts,etc). Plus less of an obstacle for my career of choice as well. Without ADHD, I could definitely focus on things better, being cleaner and not having clutter all over my room among other things.

I know people often say that without autism they wouldn't be the same person, but even if that were true for me that is kinda the whole point. Basic parts about me would be the same but with little to none of the hinderance I have dealt with all my life. Maybe just having either ASD *or* ADHD would have made things easier instead of having both, but I could do without either of them.

"Gonna get tested for aspergers - what should I expect and prepare for? Hello, I'm a teenager, and my mother, apparently, has suspected that I have aspergers since I was a young child. This is news to me. It only came up because I got overwhelmed during a music show (the music was unbelievably loud), cried, shook, begged my mother to let me go away, and finally ran off, shrieked into a pillow, and recited a prayer a dozen times. Apparently that's not normal behavior, lol.

Now she's getting me tested for aspergers - she claims that I need help to solve my social issues, which, admittedly, are hurting my life quite a bit, though I'm not sure how much of it is due to me being socially-obvlivious and how much of it is just me not caring and generally having a very stubborn, individualistic personality. You don't know what you don't know, I guess - it sometimes takes me years to look back on things I say and realize how socially-oblivious I was.

Anyway, that's probably enough context. My mother has told me to write a list of all of my social struggles to relate to whatever doctor I'll be seeing. I was just curious if anyone who's been through the testing process can tell me what to expect, how to prepare, etc. Thanks.",1
"Male aspies suddenly looking older and losing part of your identity? 42M here  One of the common tropes for us is looking far younger than our ages. 

And I did for YEARS. Until 36 or 37 I still looked boyish. People routinely would say  ""Damn bro, I thought you were like 23!"" 

Not just older folks, but I'm talking even very young adults at work born in 1998 or something too!

Not only did it feel awesome, but it was a security blanket as a late bloomer. If I was a little awkward or didn't grasp something or hadn't reached certain life milestones, it felt forgiven or overlooked easier. Quirky qualities just go hand in hand with appearing young.

Now though?

Most people aren't surprised by my age anymore, which hurts bad. I'm always talking about the 80s (and 90s) pop culture and they don't push back or think I wasn't around then.

 I feel like a stranger in my own body no longer receiving the positive attention I once did when I looked like an androgynous '00s emo type. Losing my looks forces me to navigate a world I'm still not that familiar with or ready for. I don't have the life experience to back up how old I started looking with nasolabial folds and deep forehead lines.

Granted this is a technicality, but I'm also salty about being the tail end of Gen X (1981) and lumped more with people older than me than with people younger. Makes growing/looking older even scarier.

That means on paper, I supposedly am the same as people born in 1962-65 (who could have been teen parents to me) while different from people born in 1982-85 (Old Millennials that I grew up with).

For context, I'm to the left of Bernie and I don't like hierarchy, so I guess looking more like a traditional cisgender middle aged white dude makes me feel like an oppressor, when I'm just a big hippie stoner in reality.

I can get easily offended by stuff that doesn't even have anything to do with me, and I don't know whether it's just narcissism, or if it's a glitch in my hyper-empathy, or something else.

I think a lot of it has to do with wording. Like, if I stumble on a YouTube video, or see a PSA on TV, and they're like, ""You need to change this aspect of your life in order to achieve this goal,"" my initial reaction is ""Screw you, I'm not changing. I don't even WANT that result!"" Even though, clearly, I'm just not the audience for the message.

If the wording is different though, my reaction will be different. If it's worded more like, ""If you're struggling to meet this goal, here's what you can change,"" then my reaction is more like ""Oh cool, this is probably helpful to whoever needs it.""

Typing this all out is making me wonder whether it's actually a problem with me, or just a problem with whoever is writing these things. If your goal is to help people, you really need to choose your wording carefully.

"I’m a teacher who unfortunately misses some important stuff Hey everyone, so I’m not going to sugar coat it, I got in some trouble today, and I ended up self reporting. So, for background knowledge, I am a student teacher and I’m a little more than halfway through the program. Me, the CT and my supervisor agree that it’s going very well, except in 1 aspect. Unfortunately, it’s the aspect that is the most important. Student safety. As I was finishing up my lesson right before lunch, I was telling students to pick up trash from the floor, and they weren’t listening so I decided to pick up trash myself. In the 10 seconds that I bent down to pick everything up, a student left the classroom without me realizing it, and some students began horse-playing and when I had the situation explained to me, I realized that someone could have gotten seriously hurt. My CT explained that I could get in a lot of trouble for that, which I was aware of. If this sounds bad, it’s because it is. As you know, I am on the Autism Spectrum, so when things are structured and have a schedule than I excel at the job. However, transition time is really rough, because it’s completely unstructured, and so many things happen that my brain can’t handle everything. So, I can see 100 percent of the things that are happening (if my eyes are on the students), but I can only process about half of it, and that causes me to miss some potentially dangerous situations. I told my supervisor about this and she wanted to try to have the CT in the room during transitioning to keep an extra pair of eyes on the students. No transition has ever gone bad when we are both in the room. I have faith that this is going to work and that I’ll be able to pass. However, what do you think I should do when I’m all on my own?

"Does anyone feel like they have to put up a front to fit in with society? I've masked most of my life, albeit probably not that well as a kid, but as I grew up I've learned to adapt and so I've relied on medication to help me mask my neurodivergent tendencies. I remember I used to be very outward about my special interests with everyone, though I've eased up on sharing them if someone doesn't seem interested. 

It kinda hurts that I can't share my interests without being heavily judged, but I guess that's just how it is. At least I know there's some interests I can share but my more childish ones aren't exactly something I'm willing to share with others unless it naturally comes up in conversation, which even then I gotta limit talking about it.

The reason why I bring this up is because I put on this professional, contributing member of society front which I guess is a good thing, but it's just exhausting to ""adult"" if you know what I mean. Sometimes I just wanna let loose and act like a kid and just drop my adult responsibilities.",1
"So I found out I'm all types of screwed up thanks due to my autism/asperges So it turns out thanks due to my high functioning autism and aspergers (before it was mixed I was legit label as both). I'm all screwed up. Now to top off things I have

1. Complex PTSD
2. Autism Burnout
3. Depression
4. Several types of anxiety problems like GAD
5. AND MORE

&#x200B;

The sad thing is all of this can be linked to real world stuff. Like our hard time in workplaces which makes poverty or homeless a real likely for some of us that can't hold down a job due to no fault of our own. How general society treats us. How given countries many of us live in offers 0 help and sometimes even stands in our way. And for us to move to a country with a good or better system, it is impossible due to lack of money and what not.

So to ""fix"" it I have to do one of the following.

* Find a way to change an unchangeable thing like the gov.
* Be drugged up. Like legal or illegal. Most directly can effect how you think and will take what little control of my life away (note the next point)
* Find a way to be OK/happy with things while at the same time we are looked down on society. For example, I can't hold down a good job due to being disabled and having a number of problems. But society talks down to many of us for not holding down a job. But, when we do work we can only work part time min wage, and then society talks down to us because we aren't working full time at a good job. But we can't get in a good job or hold it down. And it gets worse when people find out I have multiple STEM degrees. So I have to find a way to basically being slave labor for some support network so I don't become homeless, that at any point I can become homeless even if it is to include the support network gets tired of me, and I will realistically never have a family of my own or be able to afford one. 10x worse since I'm in my mid 30s.
* Death (which everyone knows... it's looked down on by society to the point church nuts will lie to you, spend 0 time getting to know you, and act like they care or someone cares about you or like this isn't an actual option. But being honest this is an option and I can't have these problems if that option is taken logically speaking. And there is a reason why we have a FAR higher likely. Even more if you're high functioning. IMO it's directly linked to society treats high functioning as if we are normal and almost never get support, vs the expectations of low functioning and there is no societal push for more.)",1
"Does anybody here think being autistic is kind of hilarious? I know this will sound crazy to some, but I've always masked really hard and tried to fit in. I'm giving up because the world is in chaos and most people are messy anyway. The average person is so egotistical and arrogant that they live their life needing to feel superior to everyone around them. Many of them look down on homeless people, people from different income brackets, different races, addicts, different nationalities, ages, etc... all while being painfully average and proving the Dunning-Kruger theory correct. I'd rather be a good person compared to the way many NT people view the world. I feel like unmasking gives the message I live by anyway - that none of this is that important and people should just try to be good people & not hurt others. I wouldn't be hurting anybody by being weird asf, but it *will* make any other ""weird"" people feel better about being themselves. So who cares? Being autistic is like being an internet troll in real life, imo. It's like, if I'm already not fitting in easily, and you're going to dislike me because of my mannerisms and differences, then let me unabashedly be myself to the irritation of those I wouldn't want to know anyway? If someone dislikes me for being socially different, then they're not for me. We'll all die one day, and the Autistic life expectancy is low anyway so what are we doing trying so hard to make everyone around us happy at our own expense? Or maybe it's just me.",1

"Communicating Sigh. I went downstairs to get a drink. My wife was sitting on the couch, with her tv show on. I don’t care and didn’t think anything of it. I went into the garage to refill the drinks and had to step over a mess she made yesterday (and she admits).

She told me, after getting worked up about potential work travel in a few years if I get promoted (yes…), that she was only sitting down for three minutes and would clean the garage now.

I said “Okay”

She proceeded to yell at me about the tone and meaning of those four letters. I explained that I’m sure she was doing something else and I don’t want her to feel I’m redirecting her to a different task. She tells me that it was horrible the way I said okay (and allegedly I had facial expressions) and that she’s tired of telling me when I say something not nice and I say it means something different. Said it is my “responsibility to fix this.”

I’m like 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️

I feel she’s hyper attuned to anything negative. And she didn’t appreciate when I said we’re talking about Potential work travel in like 5 or 6 years. I feel like it’s mountain out of mole hill here. 

But I’m sharing this on this sub because she’s telling me, to me, that she’s not going to give any wiggle room to me on communication, knowing it’s hard for me to make the proper facial expressions and sound and connect with words and terms and watching out for no pauses. We’ve been together 15 years and I feel I give her so much slack (like how I didn’t care she made that big mess yesterday; I certainly never said a word about it), and I’m scrutinized and crucified for everything.

I feel like it’s better to just not share. Not talk. Not be present. I don’t feel safe being vulnerable and unmasked. And I need to unmask to keep my sanity.

I dunno. Not looking for any responses. Just venting.",1
"Anyone here have experience with resolving trauma symptoms that amplify ASD? Wondering if I should switch therapists (autism/trauma) Originally posted in r/askatherapist but figured I would post here too.

**Background**: I'm 25M and had (IMO) a pretty rough early life. I had no friends for most of my childhood, and when I finally did start making friends it was because of a false persona I had created, so I didn't really feel connected to them. My parents also fought a lot and my father was abusive to me occasionally (he drank and smoked pot almost constantly, but I didn't know it until I was older), but died when I was 10. I also have an abusive sister who lived with me when I was a teenager, among some SA incidents, seeing violence growing up, and many other things. As a result, relationships are extremely triggering for me and interacting with people at all is draining and difficult. I have so much anxiety about saying the wrong thing, in addition to deep shame about myself, that I heavily mask my personality by telling lies and remaining quiet. My first relationship was when I was 25 and my first friendship besides my best friend was when I was 24, so I am behind in this way.

I also have an autism diagnosis, which I mask as well. However, I truly believe (and my current therapist believes similarly) that my autism is very mild and does not explain the relational difficulties I have. For a long time, I acted as if I didn't want friendships or relationships, while feeling lonely deep down (which IMO is more trauma based than biological). My therapist is not well-informed at treating trauma, but I have done some ""trauma recovery"" on my own and feel way better about myself and some areas of my life are much better. Namely, I've stopped taking things personally so often and my ""recovery time"" from getting offended is much faster. However, I still have a lot to work on.

**Therapy so far**: Saw a psychodynamic therapist for a year in 2018 for depression that I no longer have, then an autism specialist who used a CBT-like approach from 2019 to present.

I have started reading Pete Walker's work regarding C-PTSD and my therapist and I both believe that this could be affecting me. Pete mentions that the Freeze response is often characterized by ""escape"" strategies like maladaptive daydreaming, ""zoning out,"" and use of sedative drugs (pot, alcohol) and compulsive overeating, which are all things I struggle with. I won't claim to have C-PTSD as I'm not diagnosed, but my therapist and I both think attempting a similar type of recovery process could serve me well.

**My question**: Like I mentioned, my current therapist does not know much about trauma healing and thus most of our recent therapy sessions has been me reporting to her what I have researched and getting her opinion. She has said that she will start doing some of her own research too. I am starting to think that it may be better for me to switch to someone who knows more about trauma, but it's likely that that person wouldn't know much about autism, so... I don't know. Plus, what therapy modality would I even look for? The stuff Pete Walker does seems like a niche type of psychodynamic therapy, and then I might do it and find out that all of this ended up being biological anyway. What would you recommend?

**tl;dr: I have autism and a trauma history and see an autism specialist who doesn't do much trauma work. I am thinking about switching to someone who specializes in trauma, but am worried about the risks. What do you think?**",1

"absolutely hate that I can't even do my relatively undemanding job This is a vent more than anything else.

There are just so many ordinary, basic things that happen frequently at work that I find enormously stressful, for example if I get unclear instructions (and for psychological reasons I don't really understand I always seem incapable of just asking for clarification), or if I have to give an estimated completion date for a project when I'm not really sure how long it's going to take, or when someone expects me to know about something I haven't been told about, or when I'm given multiple tasks at once, etc. At least some of these things generally happen multiple times a day and often bring me to the verge of an outright meltdown.

But these are just normal, basic, fundamental things, that I'd encounter basically whatever job I did, and it's not reasonable to expect other people to change their behaviour to the extent that they would have to to avoid things like this. Everyone else around me seems to be so capable and even handle just normal things and I hate that about myself",1

"What next? Recently diagnosed in UK… I’ve recently been diagnosed by Psychiatry UK through NHS Right to Choose. The report is being written to my GP.

"Spatial ability may be a strength of people with Autism There is evidence that people with Autism, on average, outperform neurotypicals when it comes to spatial ability. Frith (1993) and Baron-Cohen (1997) have discussed the advantage Autistic people display in the block design and embedded figures tests. This relates to the solitary foraging hypothesis (Reser, 2011), which states that autistic traits are associated with ""ecological competence"" (AKA superior hunting and foraging). 

Kell and Lubinski (2013) found that spatial ability is neglected in educational settings. Mathematics and linguistics are a large focus and as a result many talented individuals do not reach their potential. Even standard spatial tests, such as block design, only feature 2D models. I believe that spatial tests can be improved and spatial skills facilitated for, enhancing the schooling experience of many people with Autism.

I have designed a spatial test with this purpose in mind. If you are interested in discovering your own spatial ability, do give it a go. It is completely picture based, and you may find it enjoyable. Use the code CASA20OFF to take it for free. Link --> [https://www.npiqtest.com/casa](https://www.npiqtest.com/casa)",1

"When someone speaks to me, and I hear/understand each word individually, but I don't know what they're telling me... At work, in conversation I'm having where someone is speaking directly to me (all this happens over Slack calls) it's like their words become blurry. I hear everything they're saying word-for-word, but sometimes the words are not creating a full enough picture for me.

There's a full sentence coming my way...and I hear it all. But I'm not understanding.

This happens particularly when I'm new to talking to someone in particular.

But not all the time. A lot of the time I'm fully hearing everything.

I'm not sure what's triggering it yet. All I know is that my brain did not process that information in real time and I'll get to ask them to say what they just said in another way.

Actually I JUST realized it happens mainly when someone is speaking TO ME, or at least when I'm highly involved in what they're sharing (such as when they're speaking to the team I'm in.)

I went to the park and something made me message a coworker about meeting at the park. We talked and not about work. I realized that outside of work, I don’t do anything but talk about work. It felt good to just talk with someone about not work.

I still feel like shit. I want to let the guy from the second job that I did not even start at, what happened and how there is no way I could manage that much. I was very optimistic and excited until it was time and I basically blanked out on life.

I'm feeling so intolerant of this change in my life. I honestly do not care about money enough to do this. My entire schedule has changed and I really don't like it. How do I cope when I'm getting into a career that I don't want?

I'm a chronic full time work quiter. I hate the idea of it. Hours and hours of pretending to be interested and masking the entire time. I want to be back on pool deck where nobody bothered me and I occasionally saved a life.

But I need a higher income. Is the trade off that I'll be more miserable for more money? This isn't freedom, this is capitalist control",1

"I need to vent, here are some things I’d do at my job if I were put in a general management position at my main job 
I would finally have a sit down with my shift managers and assistant managers and go over some things

1. First things first, I would immediately sit down with my shift managers and tell them they are no longer allowed to pick favorites and they don’t get to pick and choose to enforce policies on an arbitrary basis anymore. I consider this a form of misconduct coming from a shift manager and it will now be a discipline able offense. From now on they must enforce the policies on an equal basis.

2. If you are caught using your position as a member of management to intimidate, harass, or bully, you will be immediately demoted and suspended for a week without pay pending a decision to either let you go or keep you around.

3. If the average employee would get written up for something, you will too. Your status as a manager means nothing in terms of special treatment if you are caught violating company policy.",1

"I don't know where else to say this, but I'm sure you guys can understand For context: I tend to have 3 special interests going at any given time. The first two spots are for Transformers and Sonic The Hedgehog, but spot #3 usually shifts around. Right now, it's Vtubers and Vtubing in general. When I found Vtubers, it actually felt like I found others of my kind. I was in awe at how they were able to find love and support from both their fans and other Vtubers for being themselves and it made me want to seek out that same kind of connection (you can probably tell where this is going).

Let me state right here that I'm aware of what a parasocial relationship is and I practice keeping that distance between myself and them, lest I become a stalker that gets the cops on his @$s. That being said, lately I've found that if a group of Vtubers start to talk and laugh and have a good time in general, or if a singular Vtuber starts talking about other Vtubers they know, I get such a sense of FOMO that I sometimes have to turn them off to avoid going into a depressive slump for hours. I'm active where they are and I'm putting in streams (though because I have a full time job, I can only really stream once a week at the most), and I understand that it'll take time for me to gain ground, but part of me is still impatient and pushing for the connection to happen now and it's every bit as annoying as the near crippling feelings of loneliness I get from watching them.

If we never had amygdalas, then humans would be more tamer. This means we would never retaliate against our enemies from all walks of life or do ridiculous things. I understand that being called immature is what the naysayers believes. But, it's hard not to take people's opinions too personal.

"Take great care with how you medicate **This post isn't about soliciting medical advice or providing it, I'm just giving my observation and experience.**

Amphetamines and ADHD medication largely turned me into a terrible human and caused bouts of inhumanity in me.

It's euphoric, and I confused that euphoria with ""wow this is working magic on me.""

I really evaluate how I interact with others on speed and how I conduct myself in public settings, and it's like yes I am disinhibited and that makes me feel like being more social and I have all this energy, but the things I say and do aren't necessarily... I mean at best unbecoming at worst wired and hurtful.

It doesn't really give me empathy, there are things that do (**some of you might know what these are**) but it's more of like taking out a loan for my energy reserves.

I did a lot of prescription speed to get through college, and can honestly say it affected my chemistry in away that I'm just sort of recovering from.

I've found certain GABA-genic substances to be better at giving me energy and for recovery (**burn out**), but these also have their drawbacks in the form of increased aggression and irritability.

Like does anyone else have something that they loved and put a lot of time and energy into that they felt was part of who they are but no longer feel like they can be a part of? I have made this realization that a feel this way with a hobby/special interest of mine. I used to be really into going to anime conventions and cosplay. I don’t go to as many cons anymore which I just save up and go to out of state ones but I no longer cosplay anymore either. I used to love it. It was a way to make new friends.

It felt like I had finally found a space where people didn’t care that  I was autistic. But it ended up being like everything else. The people who didn’t know I was autistic would eventually use my quirks and/or stims and other things against me. Growing up I had quite a few mental health issues(still do but I’m finally in therapy now)and was not medication properly so sometimes I would get into a really depressive episode at a convention or meet up and would vent to someone I thought was my friend and that would be used against me. This didn’t happen very often but it really only took me letting my guard down like once or twice. Eventually people started calling me “extremely mentally unstable” and a “stalker”. Mind you most of these people would preach love and acceptance for neurodivergent people like us, but a lot of people don’t seem to put it into practice. Most of these people were cosplayers. Honestly I really wish I could do those interactions again with what I know now. Maybe I wouldn’t have a large number of people who think poorly of me. Maybe I would still be able to cosplay or think about cosplay without getting severely upset. Maybe seeing the people I once called friends in cosplay wouldn’t bother me either. Who knows?

I can feel emotions directly from observing other people's body language, but I'm unnable to tell if they are real or fake, or if I'm reading them correctly.

I'm incapable of acting my body language, there are LOTS of micro expressions I don't realize I'm doing that just make my acting obviously fake for everyone... Those micro expressions also make people understand things that I'm not feeling...

I also don't know which expression causes which emotion in others, and neither which emotion causes others to perform which action. So, I don't even try.

"How do you even find out what your support needs are? I often see people that are low support needs/high functioning talk about the ""Oh but you don't look like you have autism"" reaction they tend to get from people.

I can't really relate to that, most people are not at all surprised to know I'm autistic, and I only looked into it in the first place when I was told I seemed like I was autistic.

I was thinking about this recently, and it occurred to me that I've just assumed I have low support needs this whole time... But I guess I don't know for sure?

I'm able to get jobs and keep jobs as long as the people in charge don't mind my general social behavior (I don't behave in a way that harms, I just struggle to talk much, apparently my facial expressions aren't ""normal"", I usually need extra explanation, etc).

But I've never gotten past the job interview stage without someone vouching for me, I've had places go from dead set on hiring me to quietly rejecting me just based on the part where they actually meet me in person.

People tend to scare me so much I go through periods of reclusiveness, I've been basically a shut-in since 2020 and it's not letting up.

I'm capable of taking care of myself, I mean I guess I am. Physically I can do dishes or whatever and I know how to do it, but working full time drains me so much that I can't do anything after work. My partner does a lot of the household work on work days, and he goes out to get groceries and such too.

I don't think I'd be surviving or remotely okay if I didn't have him looking out for me. I dunno. I wonder if I'm someone that has more support needs that's been essentially playing pretend at needing less.

But that also feels wrong to think because there's still so much I don't necessarily need help with, like I'm just trying to prove and justify that I have it hard or something.

"How does it make you feel being corrected or fixed by your partner/spouse? I am a recent late diagnosed 50 year old male with ASD L1 who was always a little quirky, odd, weird or unconventional. I found ways to navigate the world unknowing that I am autistic and thinking it was just a severe learning disability and I avoided my weaknesses and played to my strengths.

So this past spring My wife of 10+ years suggested I go for diagnostic testing after reading a Tony Attwood article about the trials and tribulations of being married to autistic husband.  

It was confirmed  yes, indeed I am autistic and have been autistic all my life. I flash through my memories and rehash and reflect now, knowing that what I mistook for personality were really just autistic traits. My thoughts and inner dialogue all fit  in to a DSM-5 criteria and framework. I am working at accepting the fact that being autistic makes me tough to live with and that my traits have had an impact on the lives of my wife and daughter.  

But since my diagnosis my wife talks to me slower,  and uses her teachers’s  voice on me, with some hope of correcting me or fixing me. It leaves me feeling worthless and damaged. I am asked not talk about my fixations, politics, economics, technology or futurism. I am not permitted to participate in choosing what to watch with family on TV. I am no longer allowed to spend time alone on my own as it is anti-social to the family. My prior carefree ignorance is now replaced by being reminded that it is me that must fit in with the family and that I must now work on changing or overcoming my challenges.  

We are in couples therapy with a great autism aware psychologist who helps,  but I feel my wife carries shame and guilt from the sessions as she learns more about how I feel about being infantilized and demeaned.All the while she was hoping to address her needs for normal living,displays of affection and modifying my shortcomings and my lack of perceived warmth.

I am at loss,  I don’t want to be fixed, I am slowly letting my masking down and vocalizing my thoughts  and experiences and becoming more comfortable in what was humbling awkwardness and quirkiness to a mature sense of knowing myself,recognizing my triggers, understanding the energy I give off, knowing that I will always show contempt for authority and the status quo. 

I would like to continue their journey with my wife but her plan to fix me is only pushing me away.  

Does anyone else have people close to them only want to fix them and reduce their autistic traits? How have you addressed it or over come it? Is there any hope to this?",1

the other moved to a different state but she's here to visit her family since december, and i said i wanted to see her. i kept asking until she said she doesn't want to go out with me because she wasn't feeling good, so she wouldn't be a nice person to hang out with. she said she'll text me when she's better, but i've been waiting for over a month. plus, i see her going out to a bunch of places with her family on her stories. 

we didn't have any fight nor disagreements, and when they answer my texts they are always kind and loving. but they don't talk to me if i'm not the one texting first. and i don't know if they don't want/can't meet anyone or just me. 

i don't want to lose them as friends. but i prefer that than fighting for people who no longer care for me as much as i care for them.

should i be straightforward and ask if something's wrong, should i just keep being the one taking initiatives or should i just let them go and if they like me they'll say something?",1
"Feeling bad due to inability to work in-person I'm looking for work and I am unable to work in-person due to various issues like sensory issues, issues travelling and especially social and emotional overwhelm with being in-person at work and seeing and interacting with so many people.

This has recently made me feel very bad about myself and like I am less than those people who can, and it also rules me out of a lot of jobs. It makes me feel like I'm not really good for anything.

I tried to disclose this to someone close to me but they wrote me off, saying they couldn't understand why it was so hard for me. It made me feel even worse, and like I shouldn't be feeling this way in the first place.

Does anyone else have a similar issue?",1
"How to you deal with traveling and flying? I promised myself that I would go on vacation this year as a way to force myself out of my comfort zone. Something I probably share with a lot of people on this sub is that I am really anxious when it comes to travel, and especially flying. I rarely even leave my own neighborhood and I have only flown a handful of times in my life, all short flight within the country, and they have all been miserable. But now I'm going on a longer trip and I think the flight is around 5 hours long

I have read a bit online and even though there is a lot of information out there, it all seems kinda ""vague"". One advice is to get noise cancelling headphones, but what music should I listen to to calm me down and also drown out the plane noises? It also say that I can get anxiety medication, but what if my doctor doesn't feel like it's something worth giving me?

The place I'm going to is a very safe, it's safer than my own country, I am also well aware how safe flying is. These aren't things I'm worried about, but the stress of the trip itself is what is and I want to figure out how I can better deal with it

"Unmasking and asking for help might ruin my relationship I'm not even asking my partner for the help really.  We long ago setup our living arrangement with roommates, we all share mortgage costs, etc. If I'm approved for benefits (may take up to six months ffs) I will be able to continue paying my fair share.

Problem is my partner feels convinced I won't be approved.  He has no serious basis of knowledge for that belief, far from an expert, I'm not sure he even has ever known an SSI recipient.  I'm no expert either, but I'm running out of energy and patience with, well, everything, I can't make it anymore, and I think he really feels baited and switched because when he met me was I was doing good, masking so well I didn't even know I was masking, thought perhaps I had finally figured life out and I wouldn't be depressed anymore, in cycles, like I always have been.

So when I felt into a depression cycle again anyway, a different partner convinced me to consider autism.  In sum, in short order, I was convinced I was autistic, I got diagnosed major depression/general anxiety/""high functioning autism,"" and for the first time I thought with that new addition to my health file I might actually able to satisfy some gate keepers to assistance resources.

I never really tried to ask for help all the many years of on and off depression because I felt being ""just"" depressed and anxious would is largely relegated to a second class health issue and is frequently not assisted.  Now that my partner is so doubtful (and even upset about it) I can't even remember why I thought that maybe being ""depressed, anxious *and* autistic"" might give me a much better shot at assistance than being ""just"" depressed/anxious.

My diagnosis report narrative very well explains why my condition prevents me from working and my partner hasn't even read it, he doesn't want to, though I've offered.  So I don't really value his prediction too much about whether I will be approved; he doesn't seem to be investing much intellect in his judgment, so whatever.  I think it's just he fears that I will someday in the future ask for some help here or there from him -- I haven't even done so at all yet -- and he's just trying to stay several steps ahead of that moment.  Some partner, eh. He's actually fine, he's just very in touch with how selfish he needs to be, and I don't really judge it. I think it's mostly healthy for him to be guarded, as hurtful as it is to me.

As a practical matter, his lack of support in this might lead him to breaking up with me way before I'm even approved or denied benefits.  So like, I was already stressed about the possibility of being denied, but that's like August.  I got a lot of things to stress about between my partner and between today and then.

Severely second-guessing the encouragement I received to unmask and ask for the help I think I need. When I had hope a autism diagnosis would help me request assistance more effectively, I had a week or two of good health, good vibes.  But my partner's doubts--I've been a wreck for a week now, and since we just had another frustrating conversation I'm afraid I got at least another week of this, which probably only makes him all the more disappointed and fearful.",1

And like, I have verbal diarrhoea a lot(!!) which I actually thought was my ADHD until today because I always got told (even by drs) that people with Asperger’s aren’t good at talking to people, but I don’t know how to stop! And because of it people always tell me “oh I’d never be able to tell!”

"Just another weird example of low social status I have been going to a crossfit gym for over a year now. There are limited weight rack slots so sometimes we need to share. I was there early so I got a spot to myself. Someone coming later had no slot so they came up to me. I said I would be happy to share with them. They told me they didn't think that would work as our heights are too different and that I should move(or something along those lines). I gave in and moved to someones spot who offered to share with me.  


But why should I have moved. I was there first. I am 5'10 the person asking was around 5'8 I ended up paired with was around 6 feet. The person who kicked me was a woman but there were other women there she could have shared with. We also both lift nearly identically and the person I ended up with lifts much more so it was much more inconvenient.  


I guess you could just say well she  just happened to be an asshole. But why go after me. I guess I could have argued. But that tends to go horribly. And I have never seen other people argue about spots in the gym.  


Maybe its based on previous behavior but I tend to just keep my head down and work hard. Sometimes make minor chit chat with people.  


I don't know why I am choosing to post this one. These kinds of just strange example of being placed at low social status happen to me all the time and with basically everyone I come across over a long enough time line. Which is why I don't even really have any anger toward the person that did it to me. Because everyone seems to do similar things to me even when they don't to other people.

"The dating market for autistic people is non existent I just came to a realisation that Asperger’s is pretty much seen as a turn off for 90% + of potential suitors. I’m addition to the fact that dating is damn impossible even for “ordinary” NTs who have better social skills.

Any time I have added it into face to face conversation a few dates in (I am extremely good at masking in person) they have immediately ghosted me because they see it as some sort of liability or that I am “not all there”.

I get the; “you are a great guy but it just won’t work out”. Like bro? 5 minutes ago you were sat in my apartment eating my food and now you think I’m weird.

And I’ve said before; “did you even notice I was autistic” and their response is often “I had no idea” or “that’s strange you don’t look autistic”…. As if you can see autism.

Especially now with social media. I feel that unless you are the alpha male that has loads of friends and a huge social influence you are seen as a “red flag”.

The sad reality is that I am never going to be that person. I am quiet. Would rather stay in. And just live a relaxed life that very few seem to understand. 

It is honestly soul destroying. I have a few friends who have struggled with dating and they aren’t even on the spectrum. So when I tell them about my issues they just say; “damn dude, that’s so brutal, you are the chillest person I know”.

I honestly think if people were rejected as much as those with Asperger’s there would be outcry in the media. But because nobody cares, we are almost ignored.",1

If I am lucky enough to get a date, I am very shy and it takes me a while to warm up to new people, so I feel like a date just isn’t enough time, and I have a stutter issue in addition to my Asperger’s makes it damn near impossible.

It’s almost like I need to know the person before I date them, which brings me to my next thing, I had my eye on this girl for a while, but recently found out she is moving in a few months, she is also a friend that has Asperger’s, she is the only other person with Asperger’s that I know down here (which is why I thought it might work)— so I guess I can rule out the “ knowing someone before” idea.

I know I can *seem* selfish sometimes, but now I know that I have nothing but the best intentions for everyone which includes myself.  I just have a different way of showing it because... well idk... its just the way my brain is and I'm tired of trying to adapt my 🔺 brain in this 🔹 world.

I understand, now, that my slight oddness around others has caused misunderstandings and not all misunderstandings can be immediately solved. And that's okay. Its a part of life.

Hi all, when I was 8 years old I went to see someone for 2 days a week & unbeknownst to me my parents were told I had aspergers by that person (i'm not familiar with them and remember very little about them but they were a licensed professional), I then took time out of school to go to a ""workshop"" for socializing & got placed into the special education class at my private school (which I was taken out of after telling my mum about it being annoying (she had no idea I had been placed into the class)).

At 14 I was rock climbing with my dad and he brought it up thinking that my mum had told me shortly after my diagnosis.

I'm now 18 and have started to become more open about it, coming here and reading other peoples posts here about aspergers I do find myself relating to a lot of what is said, however I can't shake the feeling that my diagnosis was wrong & that the qualities that led to my diagnosis are just personality traits.

I'm in Australia NSW and thinking about asking my GP about getting re-diagnosed however i'm wary that it will end up being a waste of time & possible money and I'm nervous about speaking to a professional about my life.

1.most  important,   although i wasn't raised economically disadvantaged i always had a  severe anxiety of my possessions ,the only thing i have control over,  getting stolen. Which now has led me into not believing that my door is  locked after i lock it. I genuinely dont believe that my door is locked ,  i even have a permanent bruise on my hipbone cause i keep smacking them  against the door to check that it is locked

2.i  live in a sucky area  and there is a creepy guy (s) who keep trying to  chat me up and i always see em , and yes it does trigger previous trauma  i even  had a sa nightmare recently

3.  i haven't done any work for school and i am embarrassed and anxious to  ask about what i missed . also having to deal with explaining why i  didn't show up ( i also had dental issues which i am going to use as the reason i didnt show up but it is still hard for me to  talk to people)",1

I hate skirts, dresses or slim pants, they are so uncomfortable and I wouldn't wear them even if it's the only thing I have at home.

"Cognitive Empathy Among Individuals With High-Functioning Autism or Asperger's? Hello everyone. I hope you are doing well. Newly diagnosed Aspie here. Everything, including my past behaviour and traits, makes much more sense now, but I'm still trying to understand it better. In this post I'll describe something that I've always had but others have not, like several other things that made me feel different, but I'm unsure if all people with Autism have it, so I'll explain what it is now.

I always intuitively knew it, but I recently came across a TED talk titled 'Empathy and Asperger’s Syndrome' by Dylan Dailor, who is also autistic, and that's when it clicked in my brain. I have always had empathy for others, but the sort of empathy I have seems very different from other people, judging from observations from my personal experiences and the way the behave.

In brief, the speaker explains that there are two kinds of empathy- Cognitive and Affective. From   
 my understanding, Affective empathy is you ability to feel and experience what the other person might be going through, whereas Cognitive empathy is your ability to think about all the external factors that might have played a role in compelling the person to act the way they did. 

So affective empathy would be more grounded in emotions and dependent on the emotional affect that certain words produce, so maybe that's why Autistic people are lower on it, and on the other hand cognitive empathy requires you to ty to understand the thought process of the person logically, which is also Autistic people seem to be good at. 

At least that's the case for me. He also says that having high-functioning autism means that he is high on cognitive empathy but relatively low on affective empathy. I have some interesting ideas about how cognitive empathy could be increased in NTs and affective empathy in NDs, and how both of them compare with each other, but that's a topic for another day. 

I just wanted to ask if anyone here feels the same, can relate with what I said, or thinks that they are also high in cognitive empathy relative to affective empathy and are able to notice the difference in other people just the way I am able to. Kind of how you can understand everyone and have empathy for everyone, regardless of what the majority thinks.

To be more specific, irrespective of the prevalent social norms and social constructs, if you are able to think about such things with logic and reason, empathize with everyone, and believe that everyone deserves to be loved and that we should have compassion for every being on the planet. Or not, but the main point is that you don't feel different depending on the emotional affect it happens to produce in you and most people. 

Which is why you probably would have the same measure for everyone and are able to be more logical (and also scrutinize your own emotions with logic) where people rely on emotions, and where some even think that logic has no place, which in my opinion is just a result of misunderstanding logic, a very narrow definition of logic, a different definition of ""logic"" or simply a matter of different values, inclinations or priorities.

To be honest, I'm not even sure if that's what the two types of empathy mean, or if that's what Dylan was trying to convey in the TEDx talk, but still it is something that I notice very frequently and believe to be one of the more important topics that, if we could understand, could help us create a better society and be better human beings, ""better"" of course being subjective and open to interpretation based on your own beliefs and values, because there probably isn't one single best thing to do, but that's my opinion and I am open to changing my mind in light of contradictory logical reasons or evidence.

I'm just guessing here what it could be, because I can only talk about myself, and I'm absolutely not saying that any one worldview is superior to the other, because both kinds of empathy are necessary in certain amounts and we need both to be able to understand each other, but I'm curious about what you feel about this, your stance on this topic, and your thoughts on having empathy. Feel free to share any comments you feel like sharing.",1
"[I need your help] Is anyone from the Balkans in this community? **Or perhaps you know someone who is?**

This is really important to me and possibly thousands of other people...

In every local community posted about this, I experienced ableism, so seems like there is no such thing as autism awareness here. The only replies I received were insults about how I'm striving to be something unique and special, unironically coming from the same people who mocked and bullied me in school for being ""retarded"".

The diagnosing criteria are quite outdated over here, and I've only heard about negative experiences with the diagnostic process (and the invalidation of what we're going through). I've never met an adult who has been diagnosed with ASD!

I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me in **reaching out to more people** and hopefully connecting with someone.

"I just realized I have been given social security money my whole life and I am shaking and crying To make a very long and horrible life ruining story short, I was diagnosed with ASD when before I was ever even in school for some reason and was put in special ed my whole life with the slightest exception being a very horrible self righteous inclusion program I was in from the 4th-8th grade despite being what you would call ""high functioning"" and funny enough, once I got into a high school that treated their students like humans and I started using social media, I quickly picked up on social expectations and I barely matched any symptoms which I believe would imply that any symptom I did match was just the result of me being so sheltered and traumatized. So reasonably, I would be very upset at the realization that the money my mom gave me as daily allowance throughout all of high school, came from social security, and when I looked up why that would be the case, I discovered something called SSI which is given to autistic children if they meet severe deficits in certain areas. I keep getting surprised at just how low expectations were for me and the worst part is, they have to be right if I was diagnosed so young, something I could not control had to have been noticed to declare that I could not be in the same classroom as all the potential friends I could have had and that I was deemed that defective. I just want to be normal, why will no one give me the chance to be normal

Edit: for what ever reason, alot of you are solely focusing on the social security aspect and are conveniently ignoring the part where I brought how it was yet another example of me realizing just how little faith was placed on me and my own uncertainty on my identity.

I have also been able to sense attraction between two people. I can almost immediately tell when another person is autistic as well- not because of anything they’re doing, but it’s just a vague “impression” I get. but if someone tells me a deadpan joke I’ll think they’re being serious, lol.

I have only had him back a few weeks now but I am wondering if this has been an issue with any of yall.

"having a hard time keeping my emotions from showing on my face and people think my facial expressions look funny ?? My facial expressions are very exaggerated and show everything i'm feeling. It's very hard for me to hide my emotions. Often I'm making a face at something going on in my head and I also make facial expressions that get read weird (when I'm trying hard to pay attention or concentrating really hard, but also just in general). It's just that i cant hide my emotions at all and everything shows on my face (except for when i'm really overstimulated or tired). The way my emotions show looks off/funny to other people though. Some people say outright that they look funny or weird. Other times i've literally been bullied and people have mimicked my expressions. This applies to positive and negative emotions i cant hide either. Moreover i have a really animated reaction to being startled and i get startled  extremely easily.

Does anyone else have the same problem ?

"What do yall do for work? I'm 27, I started working at 16 out of necessity.

"Anyone else not like the superiority complex by other people on the spectrum? Not to say everyone in the ASD community feels this way, but some do and for me it is puzzling and even makes me shake my head. For me, I am one of the autistic people who wishes they weren't on the spectrum. Not grasping social skills and having restrictive interests led to a lack of formative social experience in my K-12 years, particularly during middle/high school. Not only has it made life feel empty considering I wanted genuine connection with others but also even though I socialize better now I very feel inexperienced than if I had actually had friends and participated in activities in my youth instead of being a homebody. Plus the fact I just got diagnosed with ADHD at age 22 explains my academic difficulties and overall troubles with procrastination and focusing on things. Plus with how dysfunctional my family was, I needed to have healthy outlets or an escape from it all but of course because of these conditions I was fighting a losing battle on two fronts between home and school.

Despite this, there seems to be the idea that I am still better off this way because I allegedly have a unique perspective compared to neurotypicals. This is what I have been told if I was born neurotypical:

>Probably very boring. Part of overcoming the social limitation of autism is watching and learning how ""normal"" people act. When you spend enough time watching people that live their life through trends and media influence, you realize just how soul suckingly demotivating ""normal"" people can be. They don't think, they don't rationalize, they just consume and regurgitate what they're fed. Generally speaking, of course, not all non-ND people fit this mold.

Then there is this:

>Ah great, another autistic sob story. I’m autistic too, and I’ve seen it as a positive all my life. Neurotypicals are, by and large, completely incapable of thinking for themselves, having their own interests, figuring out how to do shit on their own, etc., and it really annoys me to see my fellow autistics making it seem like autism is a curse. Like, dude - you’re blessed with being able to “be yourself” without having to have it hammered in by the media! You’re a unique individual! What’s not to love about that?

Well gee, maybe that is because I genuinely wanted to connect with people instead of weirding them out or pissing them off with my legitimately faux pas habits. And seeing how I was basically a complete homebody in middle/high school(minus church youth group in MS) with no extracurriculars, shitty grades, just browsed Reddit or Youtube at home and walked around campus alone at school saying I was the one who wasn't boring would be very disingenuous. Plus with my desired career goal to work in emergency services, understanding people and proper communication is absolutely essential. Thank God I don't have the sensory issues others talk about or I would be even more behind.

But that is overrated to some. If one genuinely benefits from their autism more power to you. But not all of us are in that boat.And you don't need to have debilitating mental conditions to be unique, plenty of neurotypical people don't abide by conventional norms or stereotypes in certain ways.

"Could Harry Potter-Evans-Verres from HPMOR have Autism? Hello everyone. I hope you are doing well. I recently got diagnosed with high-functioning Autism, and everything makes much more sense now. I also realized how several personalities, real and fictional, whose some specific traits or qualities I had admired also happen to have Autism or at least display traits associated with high-functioning autism, but I never realized that before I started noticing it in myself. This brings me to one character from one of my all-time favourite books, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eleizer Yudkowsky. 

Just like this version of Harry (he's a Ravenclaw in the book), I happen to be obsessed with logic, rationality and the scientific method, and socially withdrawn and eccentric (as people have told me) so he is one of the very few characters I could actually relate with. 

Also the way he applies the scientific method everywhere, even issues related to morality and ethics, and I am pleasantly surprised whenever I decide to give my notes from the book another read and discover that it closely resembles some topic I'd already written about. 

I just wanted to ask if anyone here who has read the book thinks that he might be autistic. Now, it's not as if I care, and it's very uncharacteristic of me to spend my time on such matters instead of learning, reading, writing or doing something more productive.

But I thought that I'd ask just for fun, and to spark a discussion among people from the community who have read the book, which nicely combines elements of fantasy fiction with legitimate science and the methods of rationality, and serves the purpose of both education as well as escapism. I'd recommend it to those who haven't read it.",1

"I feel my parents don’t validate me I was born in a very traditional Christian family. I made a lot of efforts to socialize to have friends and girlfriends.

I’m 31 M currently have a 23 yo gf. 

During my twenties I managed with my efforts to be accepted in one of the best design school in the world. I graduated with success. Managed to have some dates, gfs, and ons. I’ve been constantly out of my comfort zone to live like NTs. I’ve learned a lot of skills to mask, to seduce and attract people.

I’m now building a cryptocurrency startup company based in Switzerland with investors based in Amsterdam, Zurich and Oslo. 

For me all of this is a big success. 

I have 3-4 friends but I’m not sure if they are real or just with me for their interests.

Of course in my life I didn’t have lived the typical christian way. I’m not married yet, I don’t have kids. And for them that’s a problem. Unfortunately I’m not living in a religious way. 

I told them I was happy with all my sexual experiences. To them it like a sin. I have some struggle to maintain a long relationship and I’m doing my best to have the best healthy relationships. 

They always been doubting about my choices and they are still doubting.

They actually live in an another country and when I meet them, I’m just myself but sadly I can’t connect with them. Sad for them my life is not a Disney/Christian  story but my story. 

This makes me sad because they just think God gave me all the success but don’t see the efforts I made…

- taking frequent long walks at work to break up the day
- Listen to music/podcasts/tv shows while working with noise cancelling headphones (lately, I am having an issue where I can’t concentrate on any content - tv shows, movies,books etc.)
- Get up and stretch

I'm currently hitting the gym to be in very good shape, and started talking care of my physical appearence. But, I know damn well that this won't help me get closer to people. I just want to have someone to talk to and joke around with.

"How has anyone here found a partner (gf/bf etc)? The last time I ever had a legitimate relationship was in high school. It lasted only a few months and we didn't really go much farther than a kissing/hugging. 

Since then I've had absolutely no luck with dating. I'm not the worst looking guy.. Actually if I'm taking care of myself I've been told that I'm good looking even. All that has very little meaning when you come across as ""creepy and weird"". At a certain point that ""Oh, he's mysterious and quiet"" always becomes ""Wow, he's pretty strange and my fight or flight is telling me to get out of here."". 

Tinder is a nightmare, hinge is a nightmare, all the dating apps are so neuro-typical centered that I never seem to be able to find anyone I can relate to or that I know wouldn't be freaked out by my ""weirdness"" and awkwardness.  

I've grown up with such a mixed bag on my appearance and how I'm perceived in attractiveness, mostly due to bullying when I was younger. It really screwed up my self worth and self image. There were times when I was younger and at bars that I've had a girl come up to me and ask to come back to their place, while other times being told that I have ""school shooter energy"".  It still amazes me how cruel people can be. 

Sorry for the rant. I just hate that I feel doomed to this weird existence where I'm almost good enough, but not quite for relationships.",1
"Can't stand but also secretly like when NTs share interests? So for ages now there's been an NT I know who is the typical popular, attractive, athletic etc whatever boring things, also some of the highest grades in school. Basically my special interest he also knows a lot about and I resent him for it as it essentially makes me a useless person because he can do everything I can do but also what everyone else can and more so what's the point of me. But I don't think I actually am as angry as I think I am when I tell myself this. I almost think I slightly like it.

"Dirty spaces drive me crazy cleaning does too Im autistic but i also have ocd and cant really tell if its one or the other or an overlap between the two. Im not the cleanest person and i dont clean obsessively but i clean for work and maintain my spaces with my own level of organization. I seem to be okay when i have gloves at work and have to clean my own messes (dishes, clothes etc) but i changes gloves frequently maybe more frequently than is necessary and i freeze up when it comes to messes made by other people. 

I have a strong aversion to washing dishes especially if theres food still on them. I hate dirty water but i just hate dirty spaces in general especially sensitive areas that should be kept sterile like kitchens and bathrooms. Recently i visited my long distance girlfriend for the first time and her house was a sensory nightmare for me. Messy kitchen, messy bathroom, puppy that wasnt potty trained and used the floor as his toilet. I didn’t know how to address it and have been wondering is this is a manifestation of my sensory issues or if im just being “judgmental” and “stuck up” as people describe me. 

The pee on the floor, hair, and food stains just made me feel contaminated and dirty. I felt like the longer i stayed in that space the more i became it and felt paranoid or worried about catching diseases or infections. I also grew up in a few infested places so i was constantly checking for bugs or having tactile hallucinations of bugs crawling around my body. Im confident its bigger than me just being a judgmental asshole but i know i can easily come across that way. I want to bring it up to her and i will but i also know i have to face the nightmare if im gonna keep the space to my standards or be in public areas that arent well maintained. 

Any tips for handling these sensitive conversations or dealing with the stress of sensory overload when in messy spaces would be helpful. Im thinking of having a box of gloves with me at all times or wearing more clothes that cover my entire body so i dont have to worry about something i dont like touching my skin.",1

"Autism makes me want to give up on romance Since I'm only 20 I guess this seems a little dramatic but it's something I can't help but think. Women just don't find me attractive. I have no romantic experience. I'm not ugly so I don't know what it is. Is it my body language? My conversation skills? My stimming? Maybe I should to try to stop stimming so people won't think I'm awkward. I wish I knew exactly what my problem was. I don't think a woman has even flirted with me. Either that or I'm unbelievably bad at picking up signals. I don't usually cry but it's really upsetting for me that women want nothing to do with me and that I must be so unattractive that no one thinks I'm worthy to date.

Maybe I should just stop trying. I tried approaching women in school but in hindsight I think they were uncomfortable because of how anxious and awkward I was. I hate the fact that I probably made them uncomfortable. My mom said I would be begging to be single again if I got a girlfriend and the relationships in my life that I've seen has been nothing but dysfunctional so maybe I should just give up on the idea. I just wish I knew what it felt like to be desired for and to hold hands with someone.",1

"Have anyone here experienced CBT tailored for treating people with ASD? Hi all,

I've previously received mental health treatment for anxiety and depression however have been rather disappointed with the lack of progress I have seen from treatment. 

It was suggested to me by a community mental health practitioner that people that have ASD require tailored CBT to address their specific needs. 

I'd love to know if anyone here has experienced such treatment modalities for anxiety and depression and did you find them more effective than conventional CBT?

"ASD related insomnia (Pardon my poor English) I wanted to come here to ask if anyone else have got insomnia based on their ASD?

I have had insomnia for about ever since I was born. But got diagnosed in 2019, by my doctor, after trying all types of therapy and many types of medications for a couple of years. We tried to get me into a insomnia clinic, but my country doesn’t care for good mental health, so we gave up. So he took an valuation and gave me the diagnosis himself.
I got diagnosed with Asperger’s for about 2 years ago. And after a lot of realization my doctor now believes that my insomnia might be because of my autism. But we can’t really know for sure before I see a professional on insomnia.

But yeah, I wanted to ask if someone are experiencing something similar? And if so is there a cure?",1
"I think my boyfriend is eventually going to break up with me So, I had what I thought was a perfect relationship. He was aware of my diagnosis and I felt like he accepted me with all the good and bad parts of my personality.

But one day I had a meltdown in front of him. It was not because of him, it was certainly not his fault at all. It was something related to work what threw me off. If I had been by myself I would have had the same reaction. I had a meltdown and he just happened to be there and witnessed the whole thing without knowing what to do.

I was almost sure he was going to break up with me that day, but he didn't. 

Since that day things started to get weird. He said that I was too distant and wasn't putting a lot of effort in the relationship, and he felt like I wasn't interested anymore. I felt like I was putting the exact same amount of effort as always. So I made an extra effort to be more invested in the relationship, and two weeks later he tells me we might have to break up because I never texted him back immediately so he assumed I was ignoring him. This took me by surprise because I thought I was making a big effort in giving him attention, but I also explained to him that I have a job, and I have to like… be there, and looking at my phone every 5 minutes is not something that I'm allowed to do. Besides that, I get distracted very easily so I purposefully put my phone in silent mode so I don't have to listen to all the notifications. 

When we started dating, I told him that I'm not good at texting and prefer real life interactions. He was ok with it. He used to be ok with the fact that I responded to his texts 5 hours later and that sometimes I would just send random stickers because I don't know how to react in a text format. It was never a problem before, and I can't help but think that after my meltdown he started to reconsider this relationship because my autism is not just being funny and quirky and socially unaware in a cute way, it also involves other symptoms that are very serious, and he should have been aware since the moment I told him about my diagnosis because he has a sibling that is also on the spectrum, so I assumed he would know one thing or two about dealing with neuro divergent people.

Anyways, he didn't break up with me that day but keeps acting weird and I just think he will come up with some other random excuse to put a hypothetical break up on the table again. I don't want to break up with him but at the same time there's a part of me who wants to break up first and run away because I don't want to be constantly tested and feel like I'm not enough to my partner. I am done feeling like I disappoint everyone in my life for being who I am, because I will never be neurotypical enough for them. 

I just wanted to know if you've had similar experiences with relationships and if you were able to figure something out.",1
"Two days ago I was fired from the best job I've ever had. I was fired on Thursday from my job as a barista at a coffeeshop. I really loved this place and I am devastated.

It was completely out of the blue but I and the rest of my coworkers were regularly treated poorly by our micromanaging boss.

I performed well there. I loved my coworkers and was super fond of the customers, especially the regulars. I felt like I was part of my community. It was the sole workplace where I ever felt comfortable being my authentic self and openly autistic.

I was fired last night because I had taken pastries without paying. Everyone did. I thought that was okay with management, especially considering, with some of the other managers, I had asked them about it before and it was fine.

It felt like a police interrogation. I was treated like a thief, like I set out to do this in flagrant disregard of the rules. I was told to leave and to hand over my store keys, even after I pleaded, apologizing, saying I'd never do it again. No warning, no prior communication that this was a hard policy.

He had gone through the transaction logs over the course of weeks, and through the camera footage throughout the week. It stressed me out a while before because we were aware he was constantly monitoring us. It never felt like he really trusted us. But I honest to god really didn't think that he had an issue with us eating the pastries. He never ever brought it up to me before.

He kept saying I stole from him, instead of ""us"" or ""the store"".

I am shattered. I could hardly sleep last night because I could not stop ruminating. it was the single most degrading experience I've ever had in a job and I've worked some awful ones.

I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to my coworkers or to the customer's who I knew for years.

I feel like he fired me because he didn't like me, or maybe because he wanted to hire a new person who he has to pay less, since I had several raises. I don't know. He definitely singled me out, I know that. It wasn't the only time I felt picked on by him and being held up to a different standard than others; I've also seen him do that to a few people in particular.

It just feels like this was escalated to an unwarranted degree and that clear communication would have solved the whole dilemma. If he told me to never do it again, I wouldn't.

I saw the pastries as part of a survival strategy. Food is getting more and more expensive and the store never matched our wages with inflation. I can barely make ends meet right now. I just wanted to get by.

Now everything is in pieces and I'm scared for the future. I built up a sense of identity here. I felt part of something I could take pride and joy in. It feels so callous that my financial livelihood was ripped out from underneath my feet.

I know I need to act and get on unemployment. I'm struggling with the grief, with the flashbacks this has triggered to every awful encounter with authority figures I've had.

I tried so hard there. I put my all into my work and relished the chance to connect with customers, to find some human warmth beyond merely a financial transaction. I feel like discarded trash.

I know I need to act now and do the legwork I need to do on unemployment and applying for new jobs. I just feel so numb. Executive dysfunction are depression combining forces and assailing me right now.",1

"I hurt a friend and betrayed her trust and i have so much guilt about it despite everyone telling me it's ok Late Last Month, I didn't know if I was coming back to school for the semester mainly due to Finacial Aid (I did) I have a friend who i grew to care about for a year now and I felt like we reached best friend status. Over Winter Break, I started to redevelop romantic feelings for her but I didn't say anything because she was rejected by her crush last semester The first Week of the semester, i still wasn't registered but I was on campus to give her her Christmas gifts. It was The Cure Shirt and a Hot Topic Exclusive Robert Smith Pop Vinyl Figure. Before me and my mom went home, dejected by the Finacial Aid Again, we went to Portillo's and I invited her. We were sitting down at our own table and my Mom was chilling on her own. My mind was still on finances and she told me she's seeing a co-worker of hers. After a month of thinking and contemplating, I thought ""no harm no foul"" I told her that my feelings for her had resurfaced. But I messed up after that. I told her that I trusted her with taking my virginity. That of course made her feel really uncomfortable and she told me it did when i got home. The following week i was able to come back but I realized I had to confront my friend sometime. I already apologized over text the same day of the confession. She said that she's glad I told her but felt trapped but knows I didn't mean any harm and that it's ok and that I didn't do anything wrong Making me think it was just a little mistake. But it wasn't. Later she said that she wasn't comfortable seeing me. a few weeks back i tried texting her to ease the tension i had but i just ended up apologizing again and i spiraled out and went to a friend for comfort and later called the Hotline (if you catch my drift). I felt like she doesn't want me here and probably hates me too. I felt like such a bad friend. last Tuesday i saw her and told her i was going to counseling (which i am more on that in a bit) and how i still felt like a bad friend and apologize for betraying the trust she put into me. I also told her that I never fantasize over her, which was true. All of the guilt was warping other's perceptions of me. I thought everyone hated me and would be better if I wasn't here. And the guilt was getting too much and i even lashed out at my mom. Anyways, when i explain the situation to a mutual friend of ours, who knows both sides. And three different therapists about it, they said that my friend acted a little extreme. The Mutual Friend even believed it to an extent. Obviously, I cant say that to her. But I still know that I fucked up and hurt a person who I really cared about platonically

Tl:DR: I confessed my feelings to my friend and despite her telling me it was ok, she's (understandably) upset with me and all the Guilt has been eating away at me",1
"My first “date” with a girl that ended horribly Hey, all! I have a lot on my mind on past experiences, and how horrible it has been to have Asperger’s. I’d like to share this story from back when I was in 7th grade, as this really exemplifies how hard and stressful my life has been.

Like I said, this all happened in 7th grade. For the first time ever, I had gotten a girl to be my girlfriend. A month after we met, we got to see each other outside of school for the first time. We saw a movie at the theater, then went to get ice cream. It was here that I started doing things that I had no clue would backfire.

At this point, I really wanted to have our first kiss(this would be my first time kissing a girl)and was hell-bent on making that happen. I got my girlfriend to go sit on a hill right next to the ice cream place, although looking back on it, I feel like I might’ve been a bit pushy about it. While I don’t really know for sure if that was much of a problem, what I do know is that it led to what happened next.

While we were sitting on the hill, we kissed 3 times. One of the times I, well, used some tongue. 

Eventually, her mom came to get her, and we went our separate ways. About an hour later, I get a text from my gf, saying that the way I kissed her was “gross” and “not ok” and that she was breaking up with me.

Her friends criticized me like it was such a grave sin that I committed. My guidance counselor did as well. 

It felt so unfair. I had no idea beforehand that anything I did would lead to this. I still have many questions to this day. Why couldn’t she tell me she didn’t like that without breaking up with me? How did everyone except me know that this was not ok?

It amazes me how harshly people in this world can be judged despite lack of intent to upset anyone.

That experience, along with many others over the years, has contributed to me questioning my self worth at times. Dating hasn’t gotten much easier in the years since. I’m now 22 and I still just can’t get a girl easily.

She feels sympathy but I feel annoyance when each of us are put in the position of having to comfort the other.  What is my problem(s) and how can I fit it?",1
"Does anyone else feel like their inner monologue hates them? It’s like I have two sides of me, one that does stupid or awkward things, and then the “reasonable” part of me that’s smart and does the right things. I feel like these sides are always fighting in my head, like I’m always screaming at myself how stupid and bad at everything I am. The reasonable side wants the unreasonable side to die. It’s not like I want to die, just that part of me. 

I’ve always felt like this and it’s been really bad recently. Sometimes I catch me talking to myself in public, mouthing awful stuff towards that side. I get really anxious when this happens and usually I start laughing to try to relieve some of the awkwardness for myself. Of course then, I realize I’m laughing for no reason in public and have to play it off. 

I hate it so much, every time something minor happens, like I say something awkward, or a girl I like doesn’t text me back, my inner monologue starts screaming at me about how much of a worthless loser I am. It’s gotten to the point where I have to excuse myself for my friends sometimes because it just gets too much. I just want to yell at myself to shut up.

It sucks being just “normal” enough to tell when I’m humiliating myself or being stupid. I’d rather have no inner monologue at all. I’d rather be lobotomized.

"how do you deal with not being ""normal""? I'm aware of how edgy it sounds, but it's basically the point of this post.

It's my birthday in a few days and I've never been the party animal. I never enjoyed dancing at parties since the way I dance is just really odd and mechanical so that's already a nono. I'm just not a fun person in that sense, but I keep seeing people around me having their parties with really lovely, fun people and I can't help but be so mad at myself I cannot _physically_ do what they're doing. I just can't get out of my shell at parties.


I have a friend and a boyfriend I'm gonna spend my birthday with, but there's also two other guys I'm not that close to but they're really nice and we get along well. Problem is, they enjoy partying and drinking and all that, which is fine, but I don't know how to please them.


I also never throw parties because it's a huge responsibility. What if they don't have fun? What if they wanna drink and I'm all quiet and boring and I'm ruining their mood? What if they want to be funny and it happens that I can't physically laugh (because I've been in so much trouble because i can't physically laugh at stuff even if they're funny)

My ideal fun night is just sitting at a table with these people. Talking and sharing funny stories because these people are so fun to be around and I'm just awkward.


What do we even do? We go somewhere and drink? I hate drinking and I don't enjoy spending time with drunk people while I'm sober.
Do we just eat? They're gonna find it lame. I know I should ""find the right people"" and all that, I really know, but for once I want to feel like there's people out there who enjoy my company and don't think I'm just a smartass who does old people activities. No, I'm not old.



Any suggestions? How do you find the balance between your favorite activities and other's?

"Friends not reaching out after a natural disaster I lived in Turkey for several years and was living in Istanbul when the 2016 coup attempt occurred. that was the most terrifying night of my life, and the handful of friends who called to ask if I was okay I viewed as close friends.   


Six and a half years later, my wife's family was affected by the recent earthquakes. Two friends of mine have said they heard nothing about it, and I believe them. But of the friends who called me in 2016, none have called now. Is this simply because I've moved back to the States since and it somehow doesn't register? Might they genuinely be unaware?

"How do you come back from burnout? I have not been doing okay in adult life and all it’s pressures. After completely destroying my soul working in an office job for 5 years, my brain literally started shutting down and I started to get extremely irritable every day after forcing myself to work for a few hours. I felt like I was banging my head against a wall just trying to make a living. so i quit. i tried to take some time off and get back to enjoying life again. But the brain fog didn't improve. I cant seem to get a good night's sleep anymore (I haven’t in 10+ years.) 

After a few months off i had to dive back in to find a way to get income again.

I can't think of a job that I would enjoy doing and I can’t stand the idea of working my life away 40 hours a week in any job and having no energy to do anything I want to do outside of that. My soul is constantly rebelling against the idea. 

All my friends have moved away and I haven’t succeeded in finding new ones. Constantly trying to be social to make new friends and failing is exhausting, especially when you have to work to live which is already so exhausting.

I was recently diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger's, and my doctor prescribed some medications to increase my ""social and emotional awareness"", and reducing my ""neurotic tendencies"". I talked to a few other people who have Asperger's, many of them from this sub who were very helpful in answering some questions I posted here not too long ago. 

And I realized that  ASD is not something that needs to be treated and there are no medications specifically for Asperger's. I also currently do not have any other comorbidities such as anxiety or depression, so I'm a bit confused, and I'd like to ask if any of you received any similar medications when you were first diagnosed. 

I believe that if I just be myself- and I'm getting better at it each day, being more at peace with who I am and harnessing my strengths instead of thinking something is wrong with me, especially after I got diagnosed and I learned that I am just different- I would eventually find similar people and be more confident as I am, without needing to pretend or conform in any situation where doing so is not required and unnecessary or irrational.

I currently do not have any problem with managing my emotions, nothing like anxiety and depression, and even though I am socially isolated, it's because of not being able to find like-minded people and preferring to be alone than in groups, and because I am unable to understand and be understood by most people, who happen to have very different preferences, interests and levels of motivation, things that make much more sense now after I came across ASD.

Just to be clear, I do trust the doctor, and I believe that he has good reasons to do so, but I like being a critical thinker and understanding why I am doing what I'm doing, even seemingly small and insignificant things that most people do not think too deeply about and that I over-analyze using logic and other decision-making tools. 

And this is something related to my own health, so you'd understand why I'm trying to be so cautious and understand the purpose of these medications, if anyone has taken similar meds, if the meds have any serious side-effects, and if I could try therapy and other psychological or behavioural tools instead, before starting the medications, which currently have been prescribed just for a month.

I intend to start taking them soon because as I said, even though I feel like I should know why I'm taking them and if it'd be a good decision to do so, but I am myself not a doctor and nor do I expect to come across many professional doctors here, so I'll have to take a leap of faith and place some trust in the professional who is an expert in this field, just like we do with scientists when we can not realistically verify the credibility of each and every new scientific discovery that is published in journals. But I thought there's not harm in asking, so I did.

I could always just stop if I feel like they're having some significant side-effects, and there is no harm in trying unless they have some permanent or long-lasting negative effect on my brain, but I estimate the probability of such an event occurring to be very low and hence such a situation to be unrealistic simply because the doctor is a professional and expert in autism. It's just my brain that won't let me rest and sleep peacefully at night until I know everything there is to know, especially if it regards my very ability to acquire and process information, and think clearly.

I'm just posting the names of the medications I've been prescribed, and I'd like to know if you happen to have taken them and have any comments. L-Theanine, Venpower, Neuron Forte, Citinova, DHEA.",1

"Update: I told my boyfriend that I’m autistic. Check my account for the original post.


More about to best friend situation: 

My best friend told me that she liked a boy and told me it was N. She then told me that her and N had a failed talking stage and were kinda friends. I then accidentally fell for N because we had most of our classes together and talked frequently. My best friend was extremely supportive since they never dated and she was over him and she helped us get together. Anytime I send my friend a message and text my boyfriend, they open the messages at the same time, and this happens often. 

Yes it was extremely crappy of me to get with N since my friend liked him and I’m aware of that. But my best friend is genuinely extremely supportive of me and loves that N and I are together and apparently they ‘always talk about me’ (their words)

Now, the update.
 
N wouldn’t talk to me at school at all. He usually always talked to me but since I told him I didn’t like to be touched, he hasn’t talked to me, not even a text. I gave him a quick kiss after school and that was it.

What should I do?",1

"I could make a list of all of the people who have “ghosted me” or rejected me in my life so far here and it would include dozens of classmates, dozens of co-workers, and perhaps 200 people on dating sites And if I ever bring it up, it’s because I’m not confident enough. Sure, my depression and anxiety keep me from driving far from home and I don’t like going out to bars, etc. I have trouble sometimes having long, interesting conversations, too. That doesn’t stop a lot of people from having partners. Something else must be going on. Sometimes it’s my height (I know bc some women told me) and the fact that I’m only good at the initial aspect of flirting and have trouble keeping it up over the long-term. It just seems corny after awhile. I’ve had several girlfriends in the past. But usually several years apart. I’ve had a few flings, also years apart.",1
"Serious question, is this burnout? I’m currently trying to seek a therapist for this but I’m uncertain if this is some type of burnout. Basically a couple months ago I was laid off. This sent my whole routine and future up in the air as I was faced with the unknowns. I had too much time to live with my own thoughts, and started becoming very insecure in my relationship with my boyfriend, whom I currently live with. 

I became very paranoid and almost obsessive about certain things he said to me in the past, etc. I would confront him each time in hopes of obtaining instant relief, which I usually did get. However, this was only temporary. Thankfully I was able to get my job back, but the obsessive thoughts and rumination have not stopped. It’s gotten to a point where my boyfriend said I need to see a therapist, and now I find myself internalizing my emotions more. I feel more irritable, anxious and depressed in general. Today the emotions got so bad I ended up squeezing my arm so hard it left a decent size mark. 

I just feel worn out and sometimes empty inside. I feel like I want to run away from society.",1
"Jobs Wondering what sort of jobs you’ve found have been the most enjoyable and allow you the greatest flexibility around your autism and therefore your needs.

I’m 18, always been told I’m intelligent, but never really felt like I’ve shown anything extremely advanced since I was in pre school/Montessory. 

My main problem is my focus and attention span, which I believe is caused by my undiagnosed ADHD, and is a large part of the reason I think I’d struggle with most university courses, unless it was some thing I was extremely interested in. 

I just don’t know what to do, so thought I’d turn to people like me who have more experience. If it requires Uni, ideally something without insanely high A-Levels, I should be able to get to BCD, maybe BCC, maybe even ACD/C if necessary, but ideally it’s an apprenticeship of some sort.

"Having a tough day. A cashier I work with looked at me and said “Hey, get over here! come over here NOW!” I told her “No, I’m not talking to you if you’re going to give me an attitude. You’re not my boss. I’m nearly 40 years old, not some child you can boss around.” I told my dad and my mom and they both thought I over-reacted. My dad asked me  why I did that. It honestly deeply hurts my feelings that they don’t understand my side of the story and think I’m being rude/immature when I try to stand up for myself. It makes me feel like I’m to blame for things. I’m not perfect, but I have a right to defend myself. Don’t I?

I feel I should just never say anything to anyone anymore at times. I mostly leave with a bad taste in my mouth. I’m the “disrespectful” one. I’m the one who should have “let it go”. Well, I do let things go the majority of the time. I just don’t want people to walk all over me.

"I, a grad student in Biotech, e-mailed 7-8 clinical researchers last week, hoping to impress at least one of them enough to get into a PhD program…one responded with a brief “I’m not accepting students at this time” and the others ignored me 
I don’t understand. I don’t want to give too much away on here and have anyone potentially use my ideas without my corroboration or permission but I had a “lightbulb moment” and my understanding of what shared neural mechanisms I believe are likely at the root of the vast majority of the symptoms of Autism became something I strongly felt warranted further examination in a laboratory setting. 

The idea, of course, didn’t originate entirely with me. But I recognized the broader implications of some relatively recent studies and how they supported the already fairly well-established “connectivity theory” of Autism Spectrum Disorders. They also supported another, less well-established, less well known theory. 

So here I am. Knowing I could make a positive difference in the world. Finally feeling motivated to go to work on an important problem. Being ignored, as always, by the people who (I feel) need to listen. 

Perhaps my idea isn’t as ground-breaking as I believe it is. I don’t know.",1
"My baby-cousin's growth is starting to seriously worry me. Am I overreacting? What do I do if my feelings are confirmed to turn true? From first glance, my NT cousin looks like any other kid. She is social, she plays games etc. However since she was little she always was a little ""shy"": Even with relatives, she refused to talk on the phone. Meeting someone new, she would become nonverbal & hide behind her mother's legs and outside, she would rarely show interest in other people. She also had always been a ""realist"": she always preferred educational shows over fiction shows. Even her pretend-plays were simple stuff like ""playing house"", or ""playing doctor"". Nothing more.

But that's okay. Some kids are a little more shy. Some are more the sciency ""no-nonsens"" types. And at first, those things indeed weren't really problems.

In general:, a lot of the stuff I thought of as ""oddities"", were mostly stuff I realized I projected: The only childhood I knew was my own. I was an incredibly outgoing, curious, book loving and hyperactive child -so seeing any child without a special interest, without bursting energy made me a little worried at first. And every time, I was told that this was okay. This is just how some kids are. And I calmed myself with it...well, until now.

As time goes on here, her ""traits"" are starting to get...concerning. 

From being ""simply realistic"", she is now developing an incredible hatred for anything ""not normal"": In its ""lightest"" form, its just whenever a show comes up with fictional ""non real"" aspects. At best, she gets incredibly confused. I tried to recently show her ""Spirited Away"" and she just got irritated about all the things that ""couldn't exist"". When I tried to jokingly insist that a certain monster existed, she nearly had a screaming fit. 

In its strongest form, she is having fits about people. Being autistic, I have a tend to rock back and forth. I tried to explain it to her numerous times, but she still gets insanely angry at it. One time, she even climbed upon the sofa and tried to physically restrain me. I first thought it was funny, but when I saw her face, I realized how serious she was being in that moment. Other times she gets angry at people not doing sth. the ""correct"" way.

Despite that, she also tends to jump into various extremes. Now tbf, that'd might be another kid thing. However, she again, tends to take it very...far. For example: During a dinner, she suddenly announced that she wasn't going to eat meat anymore, because a animal died for it. Okay. Fair enough. But then she continued: Yelling at us how we're (her mother and me) murderers for eating meat. I remember how baffled I was when she said that, because...I mean...the kid's 8yo. You'd think you hear this type of stuff at age 14yo, but nope. In the end, this also seemed to be just a short phase, as at the end of the dinner, she quickly re-changed her mind and ate the last meat. Which -again, is a kids thing. But the way she jumped to such an extreme end to directly call us ""murderers"" was very odd (and -no. This is not to start a debate about that topic).

I'm not going to lie, it seems probably ridiculous what I'm feeling rn. But the more time I'm trying to spend with her...the more I'm starting to feel afraid. Like. I don't want to call her anything. I want to firmly believe/hope that she is just a cranky child. She will grow up. She will understand. But...

Listen. I'll be blunt. I know how cruel children can be. I've seen it with my own two eyes. This special mix of not-knowing, but also ""insisting"" is how a lot of bullying can start as early as Kindergarten. They grow, not realizing that their worldview is subjective. That their words hurt someone. Especially NT children are the biggest harm to ND children a lot.

I know it's probably just my CPTSD to a degree. But I slowly find myself harder and harder to love her. The more red flags I see about her behaviour, the more I fear what type of human she might become. What if she's already hurting other children? What if she's already hurting another ND child, like I was? What if she grows up to hate me and see me as ""deranged""? What if she will escalate into an extreme field?

Right now, she has no idea that I'm thinking this. I happily pretend everything is fine. I never yell at her, or call her anything. But I generally don't know how to deal with this situation.",1

"Has anyone else turned asocial? I have spent a huge amount of my life catering to others but I have developed myself alone.

I planned eventually to leave my hermit life at some point and go back to interacting with other people. My mental health has gotten way better, I have learned very important things when it comes to socializing and I have been overall preparing to interact and connect with people even to the same levels that neurotypicals are capable of. 

I just happened to meet other autistic people and people on campus have been more friendly to me. But I'm not socializing with them, I do not interact with them because I don't want to.

I'm not even coping at this point. I have the opportunity and the resources to have a social life. Actually, the healthiest social life that I could have asked for, since now I'm more self aware, I can spot toxic people easily and set boundaries. Yet I have zero drive to do so.

What do I do now? I have no idea.

I see people here suffering from social anxiety and the autistic guys I met wishing to make a minecraft server with me. I also see neurotypicals that want me to interact with them and maybe tell them what have I done last weekend or go for a drink. I used to have strong desire to meet new people and have genuine friendships. Now I feel like people bring nothing to me. Not in a depressing way or through hate.

You see, I'm also asexual and aromantic and I know what it is not to be attracted to people in certain ways. I enjoy spending time with people but I don't feel like there is something inside me that is pulling me to actually want to spend time with them. I can tell that I used to feel this way years ago because I wanted new friends but now it feels like there is no social desire and I have only realized this by integrating again with society for the first time since 2019.

Have I reached nirvana or some other shit?

Am I the only one that has gone through this, or there is maybe more of you? Anyways, if anyone is interested in the specific things that you have to do to remove your desire to be with people AMA or I'll try to make a tutorial idk.",1

"My partner's implicit communication feels like gaslighting My husband (NT, N47) of 20 years and I (ND, F44) are going through a difficult time and I have noticed that so much of our tough conversations feel like gaslighting. When I looked at it closely and from every angle ;) it seems like this is the pattern:

\-He tells me something about himself, ""I've always been this way, it's who I am.""

\-At a later time, I bring it up, ""What can I do if you say that's just who you are and you can't or won't change?""

\-To which he respond, ""That's not what I said,,..."", and proceeds to say something much different.

He's an honest, compassionate guy, and for the longest time I could not figure out why he was changing his story so much; it felt like gaslighting, and make him seem really shady, which he isn't. Then it occurred to me that I think what is happening is I was listening to and believing his actual words, but when I said them back to him, the literal meaning wasn't what he meant, but some nuanced unspoken intention I didn't pick up on...maybe? Honestly, as I'm typing this I can't even really make sense of it because it is so bizarre to me that he assumes the first time he said it, that I would know the secret, invisible REAL meaning behind his words? I'm not implying any malice on his part, or intention, but it has been endlessly frustrating!! And of course because I am hyper-self aware and self-examining, I end up being the one to recognize what is happening, doing the work to bridge the communication, and try to find a way to make sense of all this.

Is is still gaslighting if he doesn't know it's happening and when to him, his story didn't change, just his delivery?

"Co-workers I’m hoping for some ideas. I’ve been working at the same place for almost 5 years. I was diagnosed as an adult, several years ago. I do not have any other diagnoses, but my former psychiatrist suggested c-ptsd and I take sleeping medication for insomnia. No one in my office knows I have ASD and in this country it is not understood, so I don’t tell others. However I am NT passing (at the cost of much stress).

This last year two new coworkers were hired. One I sanctioned as a part of the hiring process, the other I didn’t meet until the first day. It is a small office (4 people including me) and was a very intimate team in the past. I liked my previous co-worker and my manager. I am not close outside of work and have my own friends (some ND folks mostly). 

It has been a really hard year. One co-worker was mean from the get-go. She ignored me, greeted others without greeting me, intentionally excluded me from group conversation, talked over me, interrupted me to monopolize whoever I was talking to. No one knows why. Meanwhile, she deeply befriended the other co-worker, who I have to work closely with. This co-worker accused me of using a “tone” and talking down to her in training. From then on all year she has ignored any comments that are positive towards me, and talks mostly about her own accomplishments in meetings together, excluding any part I took in it. She also says she doesn’t understand me like all the time. I think on purpose? These people are older in their mid-late thirties and we are teachers at a small private school. They spend any time my manager isn’t in the room planning going out dancing or clubbing together (think 3 people working, 2 planning their weekend together, in a tiny room). They also talk about upsetting topics (anti-trans, anti-lgbt, wrong information stated confidently) 

The worst part is my manager, who used to be more friendly, hasn’t done anything and chats happily with them despite telling me she sees what’s happening. She tells me I’m “being too nice”?!?! And apparently avoiding conflict as much as possible was the wrong way?! I don’t like conflict and I just want to work peacefully.

Is this common? I haven’t dealt with this kinda stuff since middle school. How can I not be too nice but also stay professional. I’m changing jobs for unrelated reasons and I’m scared of it happening again.

Of course this is all my perspective. I cannot see if I’ve been an asshole to them unconsciously, but at least according to my manager I’ve been nice?",1

Even with the very RARE occasion that someone seemed genuine about being my friend but I was obviously very bad on reciprocating back. Fuck, it's just lately it's been bothering me that I had no REAL friends growing up. Sure I was cool with some people and classmates were generally nice to me but it was all mega surface level bullshit. I'm talking REAL FRIENDS.

Not just you'll only hang out if I initiate, I rarely hear from you if I don't say anything and pretty much the only way I'll ever see you is in the forced environment where I met you in.

"Mirroring someone's verbal stims Hello there,

I've been wondering about what it feels like if someone repeats your particular verbal stims as a way of connecting (?) with you, if I may say so. The context for my question is this:

I work with a young autistic person (early twenties) and they use many verbal stims. At first they'd ask me for information (collecting facts about an expression, making sense of the expression they've observed somewhere), then I noticed that the phrases were usually coming up at the end of the session as a ritual. I'd announce that I'm leaving for the day and we'd go through this routine of a physical goodbye (handshake and a hug), and then this happens: we look each other in the eyes and repeat the few phrases in question (they're out of context if we're thinking about saying goodbye) at the same time, sort of as a ritual. I have asked the individual about their own feelings regarding this and they say it feels ""good"". To me, it feels like ""I'm here, I'm engaging with you in this shared ritual"". In no way do I intend to be insensitive, but I don't always realize I'm being rude, so I'd like to ask about your experience - has this ever happened to you? What does it feel like?

The ritual repetition kind of feels like a closure, it grounds me and gives me a sense of stability. The meaning of the words does not matter, what matters is the sound of both of our voices, the sense of togetherness and shared experience. It feels like ""thank you, see you next time"". I should note that I myself identify as autistic. I have not heard a more detailed description from the individual I work with,  other than ""good"", but they always smile when engaging in this ritual.

&#x200B;

Edit: I guess the reason for my question is that I worry they may be conditioned into compliance (thus saying it feels good), but on the other hand, they're the ones initiating this ritual, I never initiate it as to not pressure them into it. Thanks! Really hoping for some input.",1

Anyway, fast forward to today. I work at Sam's Club; alot of the times, I would see those I went to school with. Well today, I saw a group of people I knew from middle school. Ngl, it made me feel some kind of way. I felt bad that alot of people I went to school with is still in contact with one another, hanging out with each other; meanwhile, I'm just existing, not hanging out with those I once knew.

At my age, I feel like I'm missing out on life; whether it be socializing, romance, living my life, going out somewhere, the whole 9. Today was just another example of that. While I have socialized and hung out with a few friends before, it wasn't consistent. Besides, it's been a long time since then.

I wish I had a social group where I feel like I can contribute and feel like I belong; to be a part of something genuine as opposed to being just there. Whether it be a co-worker, a new group of friends, or if there's still time, those that I knew from middle school or high school.

I always felt like I missed out on my youth; today was just another reminder of what I have missed.

Pardon me if this comes off as too complainy, whiny, or too thirsty, I'm just venting right now. There might be come contradictions in this post; feel free to point them out.

Thank you for reading.

As a person with the condition I've always said that I don't know how to do something just cos I did it before. Will do a task but when I must to do it again  I sometomes say don't know how to do it and people will say I've done it before so I know how to do it. But I just have no clue what I'm supposed to do.  Just because I've done something before doesn't mean I know how to do it again and then I'm so afraid to do anything because I i may not know how to do it again. My brain is different to mainstream people trying to make me be just like them they think it's something like controlling thing like I know how to do everything but I'm just trying to make them do it because I'm lazy and that's really not true.,1

I like that we’re both coming into this without many pre-conceived notions about each other, but i am starting to worry about it regardless. I can be awkward around new people, and i’m worried that conversation might taper off/i stumble over my words/etc. i don’t know why i’m so concerned with making a good first impression with someone that i don’t even know, but i am lol, thanks for reading through this 🤝",1
might lose my job in the next week or so Hello friends fellow aspie here. I have been working in IT industry for the last 4.3 years. Recently I switched companies due to some issues at work. I am not able to understand the code base of the new company. I might lose this job in the next week or so . Just preparing myself to handle the situation when it happens.,1
"Impostor syndrome Even though I have been diagnosed twice with aspergers (at 6 and 13 years old), I sometimes feel like I don’t belong to this community. This feeling comes from seeing other people struggle with things I don’t struggle with myself. I personally don’t have much sensory issues, or at least that’s what I thought. I recently saw a [video](https://youtu.be/8ZZ5FSfFVog), and after watching this I learned that I actually do have sensory issues, mainly with sound. I just didn’t have anything to compare it to before, so I thought that this was how it is like for everyone. Who knows with how many more things this might be the case. I’m only 17 and still figuring things out about myself, but sometimes I just feel like an impostor when a fellow aspie has a problem I can’t relate to. I’m fully aware that not everyone on the spectrum deals with the same issues, but even knowing this it doesn’t make it any better for me.",1
"I'm so tired of not being able to do things I want to preface this by stating I work a job that has me in office for 9 hours a day 4 days out of the week and then 6 hours on the 5th day. There is no modifying this and the pay is extremely good (I do have an end date to this job but until then, this is my situation). Anyways, yesterday was tiring. I got a flat after work and it took 2 hours to fix it and get home (long story). Anyways that threw my whole schedule off and I knew that I would need to be gentle with myself today.  


Well at work I was. I made sure to take things easy on myself, laugh with my coworkers, and just overall have a good work day. And the work day was great (Other than a brief stint of getting lost picking up the catering but after that it was back to being great). I got home, gave a lot of attention to my cat and my sister asked if I wanted to play a game. I said sure, give me half an hour because I wanted to do a few chores.  


I should have known better because as I'm doing the chores I feel my anxiety rising because I realized I'm hungry and I don't have much time left before it is game time (I have massive time anxiety). But I want to finish the chores so I keep at it. But my cat keeps bothering me and suddenly people start texting me and I can feel it coming but I ignore it because its been so long since I had a full fledged meltdown and I thought I could stave it off.

Wrong. 

I finish the chore and go in the kitchen to maybe make myself food. I can't. The meltdown is starting. I feel it. And I cannot stop it. Everything is suddenly overwhelming. I have to tell my sister I can't play with her and her friends (And I do tell her why, she is understanding) and then all of my energy for anything else is gone and the meltdown comes in full force. And I'm left sobbing on the floor, ashamed that I can't just be fucking normal. That yesterday is still affecting my today so badly and that I can't do a simple set of chores and play a simple game and make myself some food.

I am making very simple food now (frozen pizza) but my head hurts so much (Unfortunately my meltdowns do consist of hitting my head or punching a wall. I absolutely hate it and I can't seem to control it). I'm suddenly so exhausted and sad and angry. Why do I have to be like this? I hate this. Hate. Hate. Hate.",1
"Self expression as a means to communication  

I've been struggling to figure out how to make new friends. While I recognize that small talk is necessary, it often feels like a chore to me, and I've tried many things suggested in books without much success. I think part of the problem is that small talk doesn't feel genuine to me, and I much prefer talking about things that matter to me, like personal development, philosophy, and learning about the life of the person I'm talking to. When it comes to my hobbies, like playing the piano, I can talk about them, but I often feel like I can't elaborate or express myself fully.

Recently, I had a conversation with a friend who suggested that I could share my hobbies in a more expressive way, such as playing a piano piece on my phone. This got me thinking about how self-expression could make small talk more engaging and less of a chore.

I'm curious to hear from others on the spectrum who can relate to my struggles and how you learned to be more expressive in social situations.",1
"Burnout I went shopping yesterday and I really enjoyed it. But later that night I started becoming really anxious (almost to the point of having a panic attack which I haven’t had in months) and I still am today. My PRN meds aren’t helping at all.

"I meet the outdated Asperger's criteria in the DSM-4. What happens next? I had my very long five-hour examination today. When he spoke to my mother, he focused a lot on asking about my childhood development and seemed surprised I walked and talked earlier than my sister. I was always the smart, intellectual kid who knew many different things about certain subjects. However, the Autism criteria in the DSM-5 specifically mention that symptoms must be present in the early developmental period. Well, as I said, I did everything very early and mainly only had very fixated interests and routines and spoke only about the same things I enjoyed. I'm concerned he's going to hyperfocus on my early development and mark me off as not autistic since Aspergers isn't a diagnosis in the U.S. anymore. Sigh! I never even mentioned Aspergers since I know it's been merged with autism, but it has me wishing I did.

He also asked if I had agoraphobia when I mentioned shutting down in public and avoiding places that make me anxious. I don't have social anxiety, but I know what upsets me. I made sure to make an effort to let him know I have friends I enjoy spending time with (honestly, I can't just sit around and not leave the house all day), but I have a social battery.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Thank you in advance.

"I told my boyfriend I am autistic. I am not good at communicating in general, so I wrote him a front and back note. It went into detail about how I don’t like to be touched very often and about certain behaviors and stims I have. He seemed to be pretty understanding and texted me later(after school)after I gave it to him. He apologized for being so touchy and I told him just to ask. But he’s texting one of my best friends about it whom he used to have a crush on. She knows we’re dating and helped us get together but he’s ALWAYS telling her about our relationship and stuff like that. And I don’t know exactly what they’re talking about.

I feel like I’m just overthinking about this whole thing and I shouldn’t have told my bf.",1

"Using fashion to camouflage myself into society? Hello beautiful people out there🙌

So im a girl in my early twenties, and i noticed i have this weird tendency. At first I thought I was simply a shopaholic. Which i found weird but it's not far from the truth. After some ""self digging"" i concluded my self-esteem could be better. And at last i had a conversation with a psychologist who asks me ""what would happen if you gained weight? Why would it be bad?"" To which i got teary and told her ""i guess i wont fit into my clothes anymore"". 

All of which sounds very vain, which i am aware of. But im starting to realize after that talk that I use fashion/clothes to mask my insecurities (like most probably) and mainly mask the fact that i always feel like i stand out... It's difficult saying exactly why but i tend to feel out of place at most gatherings. So before events...new things...new meetings with people(or just one) i plan ahead. I plan funny stories that will make me seem likable...i plan what to eat in the given situation...i do a mini google research on how those i will meet look like...and lastly i pick the perfect outfit, with matching nail polish and accessories. 

Like everything will be fine if they(the strangers)  just gave me a fair chance. And I feel the need to ""trick them"" into thinking im ""one of them"" and maybe after they speak to me they will realise that im both humoristic, reliable and trustworthy.

 Like... writing this makes me seem both privileged... obnoxious...and just overall weird. But i cant be the only autistic person, who goes against the stereotypical comfortable dressed person and actively chooses impractical outfits simply to get a slight chance of fitting in at first glance. 

Hope to hear from someone in here. Have a nice day everyone 🌸

(Fun fact: Online shopping might be a bit of  a special interest. It would be so funny to write someone who relates to me. I can be shown an article of clothing on a model on a picture and tell my friends from which shop the model models. Or which brand shoes a or dress if from without seeing the brand symbol/name based on small characteristics between different brands. We are not talking luxury brands but just ""normal brands"". I will shop at a thrift shop with my hands and select the good quality fabrics and check lables to be reassured of my initial thought.)",1
"I'm tired of people. My dad discussed with me about the fact that I did stay the last week basically inside my bedroom. I'm a female, and I'm on my 20's. I'm still in college and I have a job where I talk to people almost daily.

This week was a holiday in my country and everyone did go out to celebrate, but I decided to stay at home. I was on my period and I spent all this time with my fiance on facetime, doing stuff together. My house is kinda big, and I like small spaces, so I feel uncomfortable outride my room. My dad says that I'm depressed because I isolate myself, but honestly I'm depressed because of people.

I'm tired of having to deal with people around me that are about my age, but aren't interested in almost anything that I am, or how shallow they want their relationships to be. There's no real connection anymore, and I am fucking tired. Every guy I talk don't want friendship, want always something more and they throw shots at me even knowing I'm not available. 

Today a guy that works on my building and it's on his 50's or did put his arm around me and he did put his hand on my waist, and it was really uncomfortable to get out of the situation. I don't have any friends, and honestly i can't find the energy to go and meet people. I don't think I want friends right now. It feels just so superficial, all the time. My dad and my step mom always have something negative to comment about me. About me being too isolated. 

I just want to lock myself away, with my fiancee and a bunch of animals. I miss quarantine. Not the stress of COVID, but being able to focus more on my stuff and not wasting energy and time going on a bus full of people to go to a work that I can't stand it anymore, but I can't quit currently, and interacting with shallow people.",1

"Too often, the comorbities are the main focus rather than the autism itself I think people often try to come up with unnecessarily complex reasons why we do the things we do and it’s kinda strange. Like, everything is supposed to be a sign that I’m on the nth layer of unconscious anxiety. It’s a really stressful way to analyze behavior. 

Anyway, I say this because I think professionals often try to treat the anxiety rather than the autism and it simply isn’t as effective. Years ago, I was really upset about being rejected by a group. I thought about it a lot. Sure, calming anxiety and reframing things and whatnot helps temporarily. What helped permanently, though, is asking a social science forum why groups typically choose to reject members. I got some good answers that made sense in relation to my experience, and voila, the rumination was gone the next morning. I didn’t need to be told to get over it or to calm down, I simply needed basic social norms to be explained to me.

Weird, right? I feel dumb even saying it. But it’s the truth. Treating the autism (explaining social norms) was ultimately more helpful than treating rumination or anxiety ever would have been. 

I understand that we really don’t have good autism treatments out there for adults yet, but I would love for that to become a thing rather than just treating the effects of being in a world where you don’t understand the sociocultural norms. If we could treat that and understand them, I think a lot of comorbid issues would go away overnight, much like one of mine did years ago.

Sorry that this may seem a little scatterbrained, as this isn’t as topic that is much discussed, so there’s not a great way to write about it yet.",1

"Questions for People with High-Functioning Autism or Asperger's Hello everyone. I hope you are doing well. I just got diagnosed with high-functioning Autism or Asperger's, though I know the latter term is now outdated. It actually explains a lot about my behaviour and why I felt so different from others.

I have some quick questions for y'all just to get an idea of how many people with ASD actually share some traits of mine that I very rarely come across so I could get an idea whether it's just a small minority within ASD or if it's common among people in the community. 

As an individual with high-functioning Autism, 

1) do you like analyzing everything that neurotypical individuals don't and use logic everywhere and try to be as close to perfectly rational as humanly possible, or consider yourself more resistant to irrationality than the average neurotypical individual and are bothered by how illogical and irrational people are at times?, 

2) are you highly motivated, driven and passionate about one or more topics and inclined to enjoy setting and working on ambitious goals?, and

3) Anyone here who is NOT gifted, or at least doesn't consider themselves gifted in mathematics and programming, or isn't confident in their abilities in these domains? This may be a stereotype but I'm not sure; at least I don't consider myself gifted in those subjects, though I am above average in a few other topics.

Also were you prescribed medications when you were first diagnosed?

Here in the UK all they can say is I have autism. They can't say what kind because it's discrimination but I suspect it's aspergers. In the past I have struggled with work as I always reach a point I get too overwhelmed with everyday life and always end up taking too much time off which has led to disciplinary and even been laid off. During this time I've also suffered with mental health problems on and off. 

Now I don't work. I haven't done for 3/4 years. I claim UK sick benefits and this pays enough for me to get by. I'm actually really happy just sat in by myself away from people. I feel at peace.

"Overstimulation - How does it affect you? Question is in the title - I’m trying to work out if my experience is overstimulation or just plain old anxiety.

An example for me is leaving the house in the day. My heartrate shoots up, I get hot and sweat, I walk really quickly (like a motor is driving me), my vision blurs/eyes glaze, my hearing reduces, I become hyperfixated on how I look e.g. where my eye gaze is, my facial expressions etc. It feels like everyone is watching me. I feel disassociated like I am floating and in a game. Super sensitive to loud noises I didn’t anticipate. I’m super conscious of what I wear, presumably to blend in and I am even more reluctant to leave the house if I don’t look my best.

I presume the road noise, the light from the sun, the heat, being seen by others/the chance of bumping into somebody I know etc. is actually what is making me feel like the above, but I’m not sure.

To contrast, I enjoy walking at night when it is quiet, cool and dark and actually as close to relaxing as I’ve got.

"Feelings of stress/tension Hello, I work in a career field that causes me a lot of stress/tension and possible anxiety. I have to interact with people all day long. On bad days I feel a lot of tension in my chest and just a general feeling of stress. I liken it to feeling “pent up”.

I like to workout and do BJJ. I workout prior to work and then do BJJ in the evening. My mornings workout kind of prepares me for work and sets my mood and BJJ helps me wind down after work. 

My issue is I only get that stress/tension release from drilling and rolling at the end of BJJ class. However, often times I don’t get to roll because I’m not assertive or good at approaching people and initiating the process of rolling.  Due to this I often times am left on the sidelines observing and then leaving class more pent up than when I got there. I don’t know why I feel so pent up and why I can’t just approach people. I suppose this is more of a vent because the obvious answer is I need to just buck up and approach people but it’s hard for me.",1

"I did something dumb, even doubt my autism because of it I went in an exchange in another capital with my class , and we were staying in a hostel with the whole class. Now I met someone online who also lived in that capital and we started to date during my exchange time, only I dumped my class for it 3 times ( not participating in group activities) and I’ve damaged the teachers trust badly because of it, which is understandable ( being terribly late, or going while I would actually have dinner in a restaurant with my class, skipping them). I know autistic people have no hard time complying to rules, which I agree with, except when it comes to “love”, I’m seriously able to not mind ruining things for myself. I just do not understand why I just damaged everyone’s trust( I understand why but not WHY I did it, I feel so bad afterwards), I’m thinking it might have to do with narcissism. Thoughts?

Edit: I added why I do not understand why I did it. I cancelled planned dinner with my class and  arrived extremely late (4 hours), while we were supposed to function as a group ( which I hate) I damaged the teachers trust, mind you I’m 22 and childish as hell.

"Need advice on a couple of questions about dating and dating apps… 1. For those of you dating or in a relationship, when did you know it was the right time to start looking or being involved in one? I’m torn because I desire companionship and I haven’t had a “real” relationship since middle school (long story, potentially triggering so I don’t think I should go into details), so part of me feels like it’s time to get over it and move on. The other part of me isn’t sure I can handle friendship or dating right now with school coming up again soon, and just that I get drained even from simple online conversations.
2. What’s your opinion/experience with dating apps? I’m on Hiki right now (for those who don’t know, it’s a dating app specifically for Aspies), and A) I’m not attracted to or not compatible with a lot of the people on there, and B) the ones that I am attracted to or compatible with either live 500+ miles away, and/or are 10-20 years older than I am.",1

"Had a horrible conversation with a psychologist This is a follow-up to another post I made on here. Basically, I (16m) was diagnosed with autism, but I’m not sure if the diagnosis was accurate. I felt really bad because I felt like it was being pushed on me and based on a lot of wrong information that was slewed by my mom’s reporting of events.

I talked to the psychologist who diagnosed me to try to figure things out. The conversation was horrible. I went in thinking that I wasn’t going to be argumentative, and I wanted to be open to learning from her and getting a better understanding of the situation, but she actually was the one who was extremely argumentative. She didn’t have anything positive to say about me, and she was very condescending the whole time (for example, asking questions like “oh you’re like this, do you realize that?” and always acting like she’s 100% correct about everything).

One of the main reasons she gave was that I “couldn’t have reciprocal conversations”, which is completely wrong. Her evidence was that during the assessment, I didn’t ask her questions, but that was just because I assumed it was an interview format. I always ask my friends how they’re doing, and I’ve had people in my class specifically complement me for how good and easy I was to talk to.

I’m still figuring everything out (although I wish I was given more room to), and I don’t want to let one shitty person affect my opinions, but it is hard not to associate the diagnosis with her.",1

"Is this what a parent is supposed to do? I was thinking about some things as I am making notes to bring up in therapy next week. I was wondering if your parent or step parent did this or if they are supposed to do this. So I am almost 26 now and have my own insurance now but when I was about 18-19 my step dad would constantly talk about how much I would cost them any time a medical bill came in the mail. He would always show it to me and tell me how much I cost them. He would even come to the place I worked at the time and show it to me while picking up a drink he would order all the time(I used to work at McDonald’s). I was told that this was for my own good and to teach me how much it cost to go to the doctor but it has only caused me to fear going to the doctor among other things. For fear of wasting their time. I feel like an annoyance even if I have a legit reason to go. Hearing “look at how much you cost me” over and over didn’t feel like it was good parenting but I’m not a parent so I don’t know for sure. There is also the fact that any time something goes wrong with my car or something(I’m not fully independent yet as I haven’t graduated college and do not own the car I am driving)I freak the hell out. My parents don’t seem to understand why but like, my step dad used to scream at me for every little fuck up I had, or he would “give me a REAL reason to cry”. I pay for stuff for the car but I still panic every time. Is this supposed to happen? Has anyone else experienced behavior like this from a parent?",1

NTs could literally do anything and get credit for it, yet I do exactly the same thing and have to complete it on my own because “I’m a capable adult”. Yet somehow everyone else doesn’t get this treatment.

I also hate the fact that at work, people just assume I’m some kind of super computer or intelligent just because I’m autistic. It’s so damn tiring.

Even if it is the simplest of tasks, or a work task. “Sorry I’m busy” etc. Yet when they need help and I don’t provide it, people are first to accuse me of being in the wrong or being ungrateful and lazy. I’m not being lazy, I’m literally just doing what everyone else does. Yet when I do it, you pick up on it. When somebody else does, they’re off the hook.

It’s such a double standard.

I’ve also noticed that in general, NTs are so impressionable on other NTs. To the point where you are almost living life on easy mode.

"Anyone else have or had helicopter parents? I feel like along with aspergers, this was another thing that set me up for a difficult adult life.

I guess she didn't want that to happen to me but she doesn't understand that her being overprotective was equally as bad. In some ways even worse. Being raised this way really fucks up your adulthood. I'm still trying to shake off any dependency I have with anyone cause that's how I was when I was younger and it's something I still struggle with in my late 20s. I also feel so immature in behind with most people my age. Hell I even know people way younger than are more mature and put together than me. I get I have to accept my share of responsibility in this, but people also gotta understand this is all I knew growing up so its extremely difficult to just shake off.

"Dating an Aspie with avoidant attachment I started dating an Aspie May 2022. I love him very much and I think he loves me though he hasn’t said but we’re not together anymore. He’s undiagnosed though he recognizes that he is has Asperger’s. I’ve learned about Asperger’s through my own research not through him being self aware and sharing with me. He broke up with me after 4 months of being together the day before traveling the world together. We’re both travelers. We are no contact for the most part but about every 2 months one of us breaks it. His pattern is asking to be friends, then agreeing to go to therapy together, then saying he has no feelings for me anymore, asking to me friends again, and when I try to work with him it’s always an excuse that leads us to being no contact again. Yesterday he emailed me saying that we can’t be friends because we both know it would lead to more. He expressed that he thrives in isolation and wasn’t made for social interaction and that he has hurt me by involving himself. He’s also expressed that im kind and fun and he feels safe when he’s with me and he doesn’t have that in his life. 

I think I understand what’s happening but do aspies truly thrive in isolation? I thought this was just a response to intense childhood trauma. And the fact that he has mentioned he’s very lonely tells me that he is not thriving in isolation if he is craving connection? 

Any insight would be helpful. We’re back to no contact. This sucks because I love him so much and I’m willing to work on things but he seems to think this is his default and there is nothing to be done. I don’t want to invalidate what he is telling me either. I don’t know if it’s all true or if he is just scared and unwilling to work on himself and on our communication. 

I’m gentle with him and I know I’d be a great partner to him. But I obviously cannot force someone to want to be with me.",1

For me it was metal, with my greasy long hair and band t-shirts, I allowed myself to be however I liked. In the metal community, degeneracy, autism and weirdness is actually encouraged. When I was a metalhead, I actually faked being extra autistic because then my true autism would get a pass.
And when people asked me ""why are you being so weird?"", I answered them ""because I'm a metalhead, we're supposed to be like that"".
And whatever I did that was weird or autistic I channeled it out on being a metalhead.
It shielded me from all shame of being an autistic, but I was basically treated like a dog.

We were still close despite this because our social difficulties. Eventually I told him and cut him off leaving him ghosted pretty much. Later he reached out to me and I accepted because at this time I was no longer a people pleaser or door mat. I became cold angry and bitter. We had an argument over an online video games because I to begin with was irritable from having a bad day from work and didnt want to play. Then he says he never wants to play again with me and becomes extremelt judgmental and critical as he always gets. Then i try to defend myself and he keeps throwing all these labels like narcassist, and im child like etc and i told him of my aspergers and my struggle with stress and depression and he pretty much told me  I was full of crap. I admitted I have to work on aspects he brang up, and said hes right but then he says holy shit youre a narcassist. It feels like Im trapped and cant even defend myself.

"I never realized how different people's lives are socially Recently a friend of mine was fired on the spot from his general manager for breaking a $30 piece of equipment. Totally insane I might add. Next day, all of his coworkers and other managers boycotted the whole day to bring him back. Not only did they succeed on rehiring him but everyone pitched in to pay for the equipment he broke AND they increased his pay. One of the managers even cried that he was gone. Obviously I'm happy for my friend because he deserved it and honestly not even jealous about it but I was shocked to hear how lovely people treat their other coworkers on the job.

When I quit from my job, I learned that my manager purposely gave me crappy hours so I would quit and that my friend that got me the job knew about this but didn't tell me. He didn't bother to maybe tell the manager to not do that or at the very least tell me to look for another job. And with the way my coworkers talk with each other, I doubt my friend was the only one who knew about this. So no one stuck up for me and which is really disheartening because I knew some of them from high school and the rest were around my age so we got along really well. Even when I quit no one even asked where I went or that they'll miss me. Not a word from anybody.

And the third is the natural language AI chatGPT, which If you combined the three, could have a system that listened to 

1.	    What people were saying. 
2.	Captions it in real time. 
3.	and feeds it into chatGPT that could then give you three options to reply with subtext and sarcasm detection.

"Ruminating on past mistakes? I have an issue where I ruminate and fixate on past mistakes and it makes me upset and kind of depressed. It’s not even really social mistakes.

For example, I remember in 3rd grade myself and a classmate told the teacher we wanted to study over recess and she let us and we stole imaginary money (paper slips) to use later on in class auctions. 

Another example I had a girlfriend in high school and she was a really bad person (I wasn’t a good person either back then either) and I stayed with her for way to long because I was afraid to be alone because I didn’t have friends. Her family hated me and they beat the crap out of me one time and were going to shoot me.

"am i on the spectrum? Ever since i was a child, I have had troubles interacting and playing with anyone and my middle-school classmates always thought that i was weird or ”different” and i never quite understood the reason why. Thats why i was always a target for bullies. I had a few friends whom i sometimes hung out with in kindergarten and middle-school, but i mostly enjoyed my own company, playing videogames. I have always been emotionally and sensorially sensitive thus i get easily frustrated and want to be by myself. I don’t think that i’ve ever had difficulties learning in school but i have had very low attendance rate my whole school career, and i think the reason to that was the fact that being in a classroom full of people made me overstimulated. In highschool i was like everyone else (at least to the public eye) and didn’t even know who i was. (Looking back, i can’t even recognize myself). Now I’ve been observing myself for a few years and i’ve noticed that i get overwhelmed really easily, i have sensitivities to certain textures and i really need my alone time not talking to anyone.

I have noticed that i always had different fixations, noise sensitivity,  poor eye contact and abnormal postures ever since i was in kindergarten. I dissociate whenever i am in a mall or any other buzzing environment full of people, sounds, smells and lights. Once i accidentally bruised my whole arm on accident when dissociating. I acknowledge that it doesn’t necessarily mean that i am on the spectrum and it can be related to something else.

"Dealing with the jealousy of not being as functional as other people? VENT+advice please I’m 16F. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s and depression. I’ve been in therapy for long, but I feel like I have something standing in my way of progressing. I am very low functioning when it comes to social stuff, I miss out on a lot of social cues, I’m socially awkward, I actually have no irl friends who I have stable contact with, and just 2 online friends. 

I desperately want to become more socially available, because I’m lonely. 

But before I make any progress on improving that, I have a horrible problem with jealousy. I’m constantly spiteful of how I think it’s unfair I’m so bad at socializing. 

Every time I see someone having fun, I feel extremely jealous and often angry. 

When people around me say stuff like “I have social anxiety, and it makes me awkward” and then I see them have friends and connections, I feel angry, because I compare myself to them and think they don’t know the true struggle of being “actually awkward”. 

Same goes to my autistic friends from group therapy, I always thought my asperger’s can play a big part of why changing my habits is so hard, but then I see them having friends almost effortlessly, and it makes me even more jealous. 

I don’t understand why me specifically. I know it’s wrong to think of them this way, because they experience stuff in their own way and it’s not their fault, and our experiences cannot be compared. 

But I still feel the way I do. What makes it especially hard is that I feel very hopeless about improving my skills and I don’t even know what exactly I’m doing wrong.

You'd think with the rise of social media, people would be embracing being introverts but nope. People like everything else, use it to embrace their egos. Feel like if anything, the stigma about introverts has gotten worse. For our generation (Millenials and Gen Z) to be talking about boomers, we sure do double down on some boomer views sometimes.

"Is an aspie thing? Always follow my strict social and moral rules but I’m sick of people abusing my code.

Is a error that I keep repeating (is a signal of madness btw), to trust people and expect they to act as you do. Never happen. The NTs are more flexible in their morals?

What I can see is that normal people always bend the rule and they really use my moral compass to abuse my will.

And usually their behavior is masked by a nice moralist shit talk and lessons about the life and universe.

Is so fucking annoying this hypocrisy and I note everywhere, specially on workplace. Usually the Paladin of virtues and wisdom are the worst.

Today, like sometimes, I bend the rule too. Let’s play their game, right? Break some own mind created social rules that in my opinion put the society under control and for what? Nobody follows, just me.

When I have to break then I feel very bad with myself in the same time knowing that everybody will break too in the same position. And no one is going to help you.

Many autistic people are non-verbal, specially when young. What I'm curious about, out of pure ignorance, is why.

I mean, what exactly is going on inside their brains that don't allow them to express themselves verbally? I know it's not related to intelligence itself cause many of them are even geniuses. So, is it something related to anxiety, some part of the brain that doesn't develop as quickly as NTs, or something else?

I have to overclock my head with tension to achieve this and my speech will become really fast because of it. 

How to acquire the instant memory access ability?

 When I speak, I first have to fetch everything from my brain, then form a sentence based on the fetched model, then validate it and then I can speak the sentence. Otherwise it will come out wrong, if I try to speak instantly. 

Then I have to pause, and then do it again. I can't fetch everything at once like they seem to do. It takes a lot of energy.

"Does your brain automatically synthesize information rather than remember all the details? When I observe regular people interact, they tend to share their life experiences through storytelling. They say stuff like “the other day, I was walking into the grocery store, then bla-bla-bla” with a bunch of he said and she said throughout, in addition to commentary about how they felt. Essentially, they stay at the descriptive level. This seems geared towards social bonding.

When I think about the bulk of my own interactions, they tend to be at the explanatory and argumentative level. This means instead of describing every single detail, my brain tends to just synthesize the whole experience into a short summary “went to the grocery store, nothing out of the ordinary, got everything we need for the next 3 days”. Similarly when reading books, my brain just skips over anything that’s normal or predictable, and only focuses on the parts that surprise me.

Otherwise, the rest of my interactions are for getting my point across. There’s some agenda I want to influence, and I’ll provide arguments and explanations to support it. I also make up stories in order to convince, because anecdotes work on people who don’t think analytically (critically).",0
"Parents, what were the early signs that made you think your child is gifted? We just discovered that our son, who just turned 2 years and 4 months, have taught himself how to read. He started sight reading shortly after he turned 2. 

My son has always been good at remembering so we figured that he just memorized the words (although he knows how to sight read A LOT OF WORDS). 

Months later, we were surprised when he read an unfamiliar word. We asked him to read a word in our native language to be sure whether he could really read or not, and he read all of the words we asked him to. 

As a background, my son started humming songs at 13 months, knew all the letters and numbers by 15 months, and learned how to count (actual counting) by 18 months. 

It took a 15 minute trip to the grocery store for him to learn about shapes, including complicated ones like hexagon, pentagon, octagon, and trapezoid. He was about 16 months at the time.

"Gifted folks who struggled and then succeeded in career post-college, what were your valuable lessons? School was a breeze for me. 

I was consistently one of the top achievers. I was put in a special high school with a sort of Advanced Placement / Accelerated curriculum in my country in Southeast Asia.

But I was lazy, I barely studied, barely took notes. Was always distracted flirting with my cute female classmates. I procrastinated everything at the very last minute.

Many classmates kinda despised me because sometimes I'd get the highest grades barely studying. Likewise, some professors were also hesitant to give me As and B+s for my papers and work because they knew I barely listened and that I crammed everything, but objectively my work was good.

 I was lazy and had bad work ethic but coasted through one of the top Unis in our country anyway.

That bit me in the ass post-college, I struggled for several years after work due to my poor work ethic, tardiness, and inclination to just drink and party.

Got fired a few times too, in some cases, in spectacularly embarrasing ways. I'm getting way better now but there's always room for improvement.

"Loneliness Hello, I have been on the internet for almost ten years now, and I would like to talk about how it has affected me as well as just express myself freely for once, not only on some matters related to the internet but also how this society has affected me while I grew up with it, but before I start- 
I would like to preface my opinions by saying that anything of what I try to express here, to the people who read it- it would only be like viewing a small portion of a blurry, shifting replica of a painting, i.e my self. A replica seen through the lens of one's own assimilated experiences, correlated with their ideological perceptions and psyche, even trivial ones, and as I intuit that understanding can only be attained through experience- it is imperative that my writings are seen as subjectively objective. Any experience a person perceives is dependent on how they subjectively process it, but it does not devalidate the idea of an objective reality as one can only perceive the objectivity, subjectively- and I think that it is the same for people as well. I do not agree with the notion that opinions can only be subjective as there seems to be a real, tangibly magnitudinal nature to reality- one person being taller than another, some liquids being heavier, etc and people can be different in a similar way as well, albeit the way it expresses in humans does not make it any less complex. 

I am not here to dwell on irrational eugenics however, as I do not have any desire to compare one person with another, i.e to say that one is better than the other. But I cannot ignore these differences, coming to the actual point now- since as long as I can remember, I have felt different than others in the sense that not only do I feel like there are differences solely in the formation of ideas but also that there are these, anatomical differences as well...A feeling that I am fundamentally different than most other people, some of you might have heard of the term ""giftedness"", now- I get that this term is sometimes used facetiously/in wrong contexts (usually when the person in question misconstrues/misinterprets what it means to be ""gifted"") but I do not want to delve into that rabbit hole in this post, instead I want to focus on the scientific side of it. Ever since a long time, people have noticed that there exists some real physical differences between human beings, for example: Some people can naturally build more muscle than others (which seems totally unfair), but apparently it all comes down to hormones and genetics (more prone to muscle hypertrophism) and again, in a similar way some people are more intelligent than others but again, the human brain is extremely complex, so people devised different methods to magnitudinalize intelligence, there have been other methods to identify intelligence but as I do not know enough about them, I am only going to focus on I.Q, overexcitabilities, sensitivism, synesthesia and some other subjects. Now, this feeling of difference I felt as I said before, I am pretty sure came from a difference in sensitivity, fundamental differences in how I processed information (Mild hyperthymesia, hyperphantasia, and multiple forms of synesthesia) and more controversially, intelligence. I remember slogging through the entire K-12 system, when I first entered kindergarten- I had already completed learning about addition, subtraction,multiplication, and division, and whatever the teacher taught us afterwards in later classes, from K.G to class 6-
I had already learnt all of it by looking up the syllabus. School felt like a place I would go to indulge in mind numbing chores and misophonic, artificial ""productivity"" when I could have been doing more while staying inside my house. After years of wasting unreciprocated time in school, (Of course I do not mean to say that schools are a waste of time, I just do not think that it is made for everyone) I got frustrated, and quite depressed and that's when I had a mental breakdown which changed my life from then on forever.
I decided that I would pretty much, try to willingly fail in subjects as nothing interested me anymore, it was kind of a retaliation against the education system in which I felt so oppressed in. I wanted to be a paleontologist as well as an astrophysicist when I was nine but the necessary rote memorization, uninterested+ some toxic teachers, even major family issues left me feeling empty inside, the exuberance I felt as a child grew weaker and weaker and eventually fainted wholly. I felt like I was entrenched underneath the ocean layer,  crushed under the suffocative pressure of what seemed to me like a dystopian, bureaucratic future as I lay floating static within the sea bed, asleep and petrified. And gradually, I went from being a topper to someone who did not really care at all. As soon as I started getting horrible marks, the people- instead of trying to comfort me, understand me, empathize with me- rampaged through me like a rogue wave with their snide, fickle and sly remarks. I was faced with relentless verbal abuse from my parents, mild but still- disappointed looks from my neighbours and relatives, even called a ""failed golden child"" as if I was an experiment. 
Eventually though, I got better, through the help of a miraculous device known as the internet. Computers were rare back then and I had something which was even rarer- an internet connection. 

It helped to keep my marks upto a decent level, alleviated the ceaseless, self loathing tirades within my head and I branched out from my old views that caged me, I sacrificed my little study time for time on the internet spent googling various things, things I never imagined I could get my hands on.It truly felt like a wondrous moment, the whole first two years of it- it was like a boon to me, offering me respite from my plight. It wasn't necessarily escapism as I tried to be aware of the loopholes I could fall into,
so I tried to distribute my focus and that's when I realized that I was hypersensitive to stuff, as well as showing symptoms of hyperfocus, perfectionism, intense desires, etc. When I reached class 9, I knew that I was different from others as it would be an extremely triggering experience for me if I had to divert my focus from one topic to another. 

To me, every single topic I felt attracted to, needed to be understood fully. I would spent 7-9 hours per day, looking up things online and watching video-essays. That caused me to deviate even further from the norm as I read mangas that affected me profoundly, like no other indian media back then could have (anime was already scarce then but somehow its popularity was decreasing further still, nowadays it's probably the most popular it's ever been in India which can lead to better diversification in art I think, anyways I apologize for the digression). I read berserk, made in abyss, death note, blam, so many light novels and watched so many films (interstellar, the social network, satyajit ray films as well as tagore songs, ghibli, the theory of everything, etc), watched attack on titan as it aired raw (watched all 4 seasons now),
listened to some of the most breath-taking music humans have ever created and I just felt so enamoured, dazzled and even conflicted at the realization that entire worlds had been tucked away underneath these curtains of ignorancy. Little did I know that, in a few years- I would be participating in one of the biggest races mankind had ever created. I was already feeling the shockwaves from class 8, as I noticed a stark difference in the study content between class 7 and 8. It felt different somehow, more abstract and complex, less texts and more problems to solve as I felt rust growing underneath my skin. None of that is to say that I didn't perform well though, I did and it still felt easy to me- its just that the things they introduced seemed to be the tip of a massive iceberg which I didn't wanna become a part of until I chose itself by my own accord, on my own natural pace. Come, class 10 and it was right infront of me, a massive mechanical tide that would wash away the organic frivolity, only letting sheer practicality, money, and arduous, boring, rote work into it, into an illusory, periodic replenishment. 



No way to escape it, I got thrashed into it and felt forced to complete the entire ICSE annual syllabus in like 1.5 months , mind you I was still suffering from major depression, anxiety and a whole host of other issues. Somehow I got through it, with A marks I suppose, all I got was a ""great"" from people, very good but nothing exceptional. To be honest, I did not really much care what other people thought of me then as I had one of the worst burnouts I ever experienced which I had to deal with instead (any of you who read this and think that I didn't try to get professional help, I did. Its just that my parents were reluctant to do so, mental health stigma and all that). Then COVID hit, and it gave me some years to recover from all the shit I went through, processed so many things that I never had before and then something...happened, some of my family members died and that kind of broke me, I felt dissociated and I felt like I had nowhere to turn to except my online friends from places far away, they had similar tastes as me and I could choose who I liked to talk to, I had a wider reach and more people to connect to and so it is obvious that I would find my people in there. And I did, its just that they were scattered across the globe, I came across the concept of ""giftedness"", which did not only rely on I.Q tests but also a lot of other factors like overexcitabilites (I recommend reading da browskis book on it to understand it better), twice exceptionality and hypersensitivism- all of which I could relate to.


I even discovered stuff about neurodivergency- autism, OCD, ADHD, giftedness, ASPD, introvertedness, ambivertedness and extrovertedness, etc. My mom never really liked the idea of going to a psychologist due to stigma issues (as mentioned before) so unfortunately I was not able to get diagnosed with any of them, I am hoping to go now though, soon. I resonated a lot with what people with OCD described their experiences to be like, I also talked with some of the members of the autistic community as well and I was sure all the while, to question myself at every moment, I support the idea of provisional cynicism so it was really difficult at first to confirm my doubts about it but I am pretty sure that I have it to some extent as well as OCD which- nowadays, is pretty clear from the symptoms- I will still go to a psychologist though to be conclusive about it.",0

"Putting things into context Hi, this is my first post and originally I wanted to talk about a different and more complex topic but I thought I'd start with a simpler question of mine:

What is even the difference in intelligence between an IQ of 130 and 180. I have no clue really, I can't really imagine what it's like to have such an abnormally high IQ. Is the difference big? Is it less than the difference between 130 and 100? 

How do people even have an IQ of 180 (or higher than that I guess)? I'm quite jealous haha. I thought after 130 the results get exceedingly rare? Like in the bell curve? And still 22 people said they have an IQ of 180+ on the vote here on this sub which seems like a lot to me.

I also heard in the US they use a 16 SD test which yields higher results for participants? So the european one would be ""worth more"" for example.

"What have you done with your giftedness? I originally did premed, went to medical school, dropped out because it turns out I'm not that great at memorizing large volumes of information and studying long hours.

I then worked for a top high frequency trading firm after college. So all in all, I just took the easy way out and leaned on my strengths, although it's not really a passion of mine. I've yet to find something that I'm really passionate about as I get bored easily once I figure it out.

"How to manage the need for change I have always been driven by a need for change in what I do, where I live and the people I am with… the script usually runs something like find out a new interest, explore it in all its depths and dimensions, usually become good at it (start feeling comfortable with it), then lose interest and feel the need to pass onto the next thing to be explored.
While I do love this drive and curiosity about myself, it does create some difficulties when it comes to life in this world.
This pattern means rapidly exhausting a career for example… constantly changing does not put one in a very good position financially (especially since I’ve always been circling between things that require a long investment in terms of time to reach a remunerative position).
Even worse when it comes to relationships; it sounds horrible, but I am afraid of not being able to stay with someone long term (though there is a part of me that would like it) because of this need for change and new stimuli.

I've talked about it in a few replies to posts here, but thought it was worth sharing as I think when kids get to a certain level in secondary school or at further education, when they hit a wall and haven't experienced it they can lose momentum and not reach their potential.

This kicked off a whole range of comments - most of which were centered around the validity of IQ tests, and how one could erroneously think they were gifted by their result, but only because that result was BS, not administered by a psychologist, etc. I’m holding that “giftedness” isn’t so simple as a certain IQ score - for lots of reasons. 

My main point is that giftedness seems to always have an acceptance problem around it - meaning it offends people and makes them defensive. This leads to discussions about the “real” dividing line to claim that you’re gifted - like an IQ score. My son is exceptionally tall, and good at sports, and is accepted by a lot of people because of it. On the other hand, it’s my experience that giftedness has to be wrapped in bubble wrap and foam so it doesn’t make people feel bad - masking, etc. (And sure, giftedness can come with being aloof and aware of others feelings, but I really don’t think that most gifted folk are bounding about like condescending a-holes.) 

This may very well be my own experience that I’m extrapolating - so I ask the question of you all. Why does our extraordinary capability cause this type of reaction? (And I’d love to hear from folks who operate with zero cares to give AND are aware of it.)",0
"I think some people might like this I think by now most of us in this group have found that it’s mostly comprised of meta contextual questions that get repeated over and over about things like ADHD/Autism, cognitive testing, the definition of giftedness, “am I gifted” etc., and it’s severely lacking in any type of actual intellectual conversation or engaging discussions. 

Well, I think I found a group that fills that void for me. I was looking for a group made for contrarians, which is what I suppose I’ve come to see myself as, and I stumbled across r/criticaltheory . 

It’s not perfect, but there are a lot of good conversations in the group, and I’m really liking it so far, despite not agreeing with everything posted.

It really feels like a group that has surpassed the initial barrier of controversiality and unsupported statements to conversation

>Question about “Entarte” - without ontological category?

>The word Entarte in German is usually translated as “degenerate” in the context of Nazi ideology - e.g. Entarte Kunst = degenerate art.

>But I’ve seen some people say that it more accurately means “without ontological category”, and they’ve been relating this to Michael Knowles recent comments at CPAC calling for the eradication of transgender people on the basis that transgender is “not a valid ontological category”.

>Could anyone explain this translation and etymology of the word in German-and maybe provide a comment on the place of antisemitism in the 30s and transphobia in the contemporary far-right as targeting certain minorities on the basis of this apparent inability to be confined within ontological categories. This notion reminded me a bit of Zygmunt Bauman’s work in antisemitism.”

"I'm tired of trying to find where I fit I'm here because I just read a scientific article about gifted people, in another attempt to try to figure out why I never felt ""normal"". Over the past years I thought I had ADHD, or anxiety, or maybe I was autistic, or maybe I was ""just"" depressed and needed attention and to feel special. At this point I just don't know anymore but I recognized myself in every point listed in this article 

I started talking in full sentences when I was 2, I was always praised for my school achievements, without even really trying. Now in university I pass every exams, often with high grades, even when I just read the PowerPoint the night before. I read a lot and I have no problem memorizing a shit ton of info on basically anything

Great right? Yeah it's great in school but anywhere else it's just shit 
I always was the quiet weird kid who has trouble making friends, being the outcast without knowing why. I started smoking and drinking when I was 14 to try to fit and it quite worked but now I struggle with that too. I have overwhelming anxiety that make me unable to function some days. I review every social interaction to check if I behaved ""normally"". I have spent the whole fucking 23 years of my life wondering what was wrong with me and I just want to find out

I'm tired of those questions, I'm tired of asking myself if what I feel is normal or if there is something else going on",0

"Gifted Children Hey guys, So my 3.5 year old daughter, is quite bright. TL;DR - Do I put her into primary school (elementary school in Australia) early? To be with peers developmentally where she is at.

She is currently doing 4 year old kindergarten (pre-school), and is thriving and so happy there. We skipped 3 year old kindergarten, as being with her biological age peers the year before negatively impacted her; she had friends yet is very social so would hide parts of herself to fit in, and was clearly bored from lack of cognitive stimulation/activities developmentally at her level. So I found a kindergarten that understood gifted children and understood wanting her to be with the older age group (she is right at the age cut-off, is 2.5 weeks 'too young', so she is just the youngest in the room by a few weeks. Where as before she was the oldest in the room and developmentally 1-2 years ahead so it wasn't great for her. Now she is able to interact with others right where she's at).

But, although the kindergarten understands, and is happy to apply for her to start primary school next year with her current peers, there has been a lot of unsolicited advice from others, saying I should have her repeat 4 year old kinder and go to school with her age group (and be always the oldest in the class as opposed to the youngest). But I personally feel that wouldn't be nice for her, and that it would be a repeat where she feels the need to dull herself to fit in, or feels 'different' and insecure in her giftedness, as opposed to feeling she belongs. I personally think children are less focused on 'age' and just see their classmates as friends in the younger years, so feel developmental age is more important in terms of placement for her. Am I wrong?

I would love your thoughts! :)",0

"Why psychology would be the best major in the apocalypse - I just spent a crap ton of time writing this on r/college, and I just want more people to be able to see it I say psychology would be the best major for the apocalypse, more specifically with a focus in social psychology.

Sure, you could do agriculture to grow food, but my guess is that you’re not in a rural area and will not have access to the modern farming tools and techniques that are taught in contemporary agricultural science. Also, anyone can figure out how to grow food without a degree.

I saw other people saying engineering. Maybe construction/structural engineering, but again, unless your degree is teaching you how to build structures out of raw materials or rubble from old buildings, it’s not happening. Also, good luck doing anything while you maintain a crutch on computers and catalogued formulae necessary for calculating structural integrity when there’s no longer anyone to run electricity and what remains of the libraries doesn’t have what you need.

Someone said medical. That’s a great point, but that’s not a major. That is a doctorate or master’s level occupation. The only thing you’re getting taught at the undergrad level includes the names of bones and muscles and how to do organic chemistry. Uhm… good luck with that when you need to suture a wound, which is something taught in medical school (sometimes but rarely nursing school). [you could also do premed as a psychology major or any major, so it’s not that useful by itself]

Someone else said chemistry. Honestly, this is the strongest contender thus far. Just from the general knowledge, you will know how to do certain things. However, having said that, most of what chemistry consists of professionally is lab work and technical skills with complex equipment. Also, I would argue that the skills you need for more complex things require graduate degrees. These  undergrad students getting 1200% errors on their lab reports are not going to do you much good when you’re trying to make a bomb to clear out debris from a collapsed building. Still useful from knowledge of chemical reactions though.

Someone else said communication. 😂 What are you going to do? Give them a speech? Use the SMRC model to what? Communicate your message about how you can help people talk to each other, all the while trying to convince people that being able to talk effectively makes you a valuable asset? All I’ll say is good luck.

Someone said physics. Just no. That’s even more useless than an engineer because it’s basically just applied math. Math is important, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not going to be that important when the world collapses. It’s very much an intellectual elite type field of study that exists just for the sake of advancing universal knowledge. That’s beautiful, but unless you’re Einstein or Marie Curie, you don’t really have anything to offer in that department, much less if you’re an undergrad.

Finally, someone said public relations. This is a terrible choice. All public relations does is maintain a good face for business conglomerates and increase public awareness of the people that pay them to do so. I promise, your social media skills will not help you in a post-internet society.

Well, now that I’ve basically just taken a massive, steaming dump on all of those other majors, why do I say psychology? Simple, you will know what to do when crap hits the fan. Knowing how people are bound to react by understanding human behavior in social situations, including how individuals respond to stress, how they form relationships, and how they make decisions could prove useful in understanding how groups of survivors might behave in a post-apocalyptic world, how to negotiate with others, and how to form alliances. Because let’s be honest. We’ve seen what happens when there is no government (Somalia). A war state is pretty much going to be inevitable, which will necessitate forming alliances. Additionally, a psychology /social psychology degree may also serve to protect you and your allies by anticipating what other people are likely to do given certain circumstances, and it will also allow you to protect against social deterioration in your own group, such as mitigating group think and paranoia that can arise in dire times. Moreover, this degree would also teach you coping mechanisms, which will be invaluable when it comes to helping both yourself and others cope with the emotional and physical trauma everyone will experience from bearing witness to the fall of civilization and the loss that comes with it. Psychology also emphasizes communication skills in an applicable way, especially for crisis situations and in times where people might not be thinking properly due to the strain put on them by the current situation. Finally, if it is a goal to rebuild society, a psychology student (but more likely a psychologist) will know how to do that- how to get people to follow and conform to rules, how to assess the wellbeing of others after the fact, etc. And one of the biggest reasons social psychology is so useful is that it does not rely on anything else other than your mind. Once you understand how to do these things, you don’t need conplex tools or technology to apply them, and this makes you irreplaceable.

Now, like with other majors, an undergrad degree might not help you as much as people with higher degrees, but when worse comes to worst, those types of people will be in short supply, and you’ll be better than nothing. And even if you are to take a backseat to a professional, you’re going to be younger, stronger, and likely more resilient than an actual psychologist.

Anyway, that’s my argument. Feel free to pick it apart where you see fit. This was really fun for me, if you couldn’t already tell!

Honorable mentions:

Any performance arts - you may not think of it at first, but people are going to want entertainment and something to boost their spirits in the dark times. Psychology can help with that, but if there is no outlet of joy, it will be a losing battle. You might not need a degree for this one though.

Anthropology (archeology)- within certain branches of anthropology, you learn how to excavate and uncover remnants of the past, and I don’t think it’s talked about enough that you are taught how to interpret what you find in terms of behavior retroactively. This could prove useful in making sense of what is left of the world, and anth also helps you adapt to new cultures, which will make adjusting easier. 

Worst majors:

Business (unless you’re rich) - you might be able to trade and sell things in exchange for other things, but it’s not like you’re going to be starting a business to do it. Anyone can do what you do.

Economics - understanding how capitalism and money works won’t aid you one iota when both of those things are no longer in motion.

Philosophy - you know a lot but not enough, and your proclivity to exaggerate the preponderance of questions and metaphysical abstractions that have no answers isn’t going to do you much good, and it’s probably going to piss people off when they can’t understand you. This also goes for English and History.

Architect - you basically offer even less than a structural engineer.

"Daughter's school wants to do eval Hi. Hopefully this is a good place to ask this. The TL;DR is: should I go through the school to have my 6.5y daughter evaluated for the gifted program since they sent home a letter asking for permission, or since our family has a history of neurodevelopmental disorders should I seek a complete evaluation through a psychologist to ensure we have the whole picture? Or both? And any other advice for us during this process?

My daughter is 6 (7 in late summer). She's in kindergarten this year. It's her 1st year of public school. We did homeschool before this, and technically did kindergarten last year with her, but felt she would benefit from doing it at public school as well. Last school year was pretty tumultuous because her older brother (8) was seriously struggling with behavior and we were in the process of getting his ADHD and ASD (Aspergers) diagnosed and the right treatments started. She wasn't quite where I expected a beginning 1st grader to be when this year began, AND her birthday is only about 1 week before the cut off anyway. She's doing amazing this year. 

We had wanted to get her started in the public school system earlier but because of covid things and the (pretty bad) virtual option from our school we continued with home school for both her and her brother. 

I also have ADHD that wasn't diagnosed until I was 30(ish) and there's a suspicion of Autism as well- based off of conversations with a behavioral psychologist, and the information/observations more recently brought to my attention from psychologists who've been working with Autistic Women/AFAB individuals for decades. However, I'm not able to get a formal evaluation at this time due to our location/ limited options for providers/ high demand for children's evaluations on the few providers within realistic travel range. 

I was also classified as a gifted child in my early elementary years. I personally found the pressure to be a lot, and as I had more expectations, deadlines, etc. placed on me things of course became more difficult and less manageable. Much of this was likely due to my undiagnosed ADHD. 

I also have noticed a fair amount of other people who similarly were diagnosed later in life with ADHD or ASD,  mentioning that they were also placed into gifted programs as children. I have seen from my very limited amount of research into this that there is the chance of both or of misdiagnosis one way or the other. I also saw a higher chance of socio-emotional struggles among gifted individuals indicated in a couple of studies. 

Adhd was already on my radar for her because of her very strong emotional reactions and sensitivity to criticism/perceived rejection etc. That is not something she shows at school, AT ALL. She also has some other behaviors that I recognize from myself- that look more like inattentiveness/executive function struggles. 

This isn't something we plan to just ignore, but I do want to see what other's opinions are about going through the school and essentially having that label put on her (and potentially all the stress that comes along with it) at this point in time. We also could pursue the full evaluation from a behavioral psychologist. We could do both. Or we could see what the doctors say and hold off on the school system for now. I'm just looking for opinions. I understand that if she is gifted it isn't going to just not exist if we don't do the evaluation. I just want to make sure we choose the right path for gaining information. 

I did also email her PCP, who's special interest is ADHD & has worked closely with psychology in the past. He recognized our other child's ASD before we did and helped guide us to the correct people for evaluations and education.",0
"Anyone else feel not gifted anymore? Really been grappling with how trauma can rewire the brain… At the end of high school, top colleges were fighting over me and I threw it away to go to a faith based school in the South.

Life has kicked my ass with a series of really shitty things and I’ve gone to therapy for years. 

But over the last couple of years I couldn’t even get interviews after months and months of endless job searching. 

I applied to grad school for a mid-life career change for what I’ve always wanted to do that would allow me to have fulfilling work, and just found out I didn’t get it. I’ll apply again on the next cycle, but it just really sucks going from having a Midas Touch to having to fight really hard for everything only to be rejected over and over and over and over and over and over and over. I didn’t get on the waitlist either.

"WAIS profile interpretation Hello, my 18 y.o. son has received his WAIS profile.

How would you interpret this profile, especially in regard to the FSIQ?  


His verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning were both around 120, resulting in a GAI of 122 but his CPI was significantly stronger, with working memory at 135 and Processing speed 125. The FSIQ was at 130.

The subtest scores for PRI were BD with 12 SS, VP with 11 SS and MR with 16 SS. I might add that they also administered the Figure Weights subtest in which he got 15 SS and according to one study one could supplement either BD or VP with FW without loss of structural validity which would push the GAI to 125. On the other hand i'm sure there are reasons why it is administered that way by default.

I would appreciate your input very much!",0
"What kind of consulting do gifted people can do? Hello:

Typical gifted pathway - worked my ass off, kept burning out doing things for others, priotizing others (and my company) before others. Long story short - I have to re-start, and I thought of going into consulting. 

&#x200B;

Though, i struggle with how to defind myself. I thought I can ask for some advice.

&#x200B;

I have a pretty good specialization in technology - specifically looking at climate change, and architecture. Before, i was working in architeture - but focusing a lot more on sustainability, integration of innvoative technologies. But, I also was running/managing part of the firm, and picked up a lot of skill-set.

I am a polymath - but, I just do not want to work that 9 to 5 environment, or have someone who does not understsand what I am doing shout down my thoart to get things done and re-do things, etc. 

How would someone like me market myself?

One reason why I want to not limit myself to building/architecture is because I enjoy more than anything to learn about new things, and I thought to myself - why not just chose projects. I also have large projects that I want to work on - 

  
But, I suppose I need a way to bring in some income until those projects start going online. But, in the meantime - I need to market myself, and I just am curious how you would go about it.

  
Any suggestions/feedback would be appreciated.",0
"Have I missed my chance at a meaningful career? Have I missed my chance at finding meaningful work I can truly devote myself to? I'm 36. If there's still a chance, what method would you recommend me using to identify a career path?

Background: I grew up poor, in the middle of nowhere, so I gratefully jumped into the first university that gave me a scholarship. It was a bad culture fit, very under-stimulating and I didn't fit in. The guidance counselors were annoyed by my initial enthusiasms and I got no help there (""I wanted to work in a think tank too, but if I couldn't make it, there's no way you will""). Finally I got so depressed and checked-out, and I was never able to settle on a particular field of study because I had loved everything and now I loved nothing, so finally just graduated with a general social science degree. I also went to grad school at a prestigious institution, but I could never fit in and I hated the cutthroat world of prestige academia.

I eventually became a librarian because I love learning/research. But the pay and safety issues are unsustainable, so I know I've got to make a change.

Edit: One thing is I don't do well with stress/pressure. I'm a sensitive person so I also don't want to be exploited by the rat race. So I've also entertained the option of just staying in a low-level job, flying under the radar, and then having lots of time and mental space for reading, painting, writing, time in nature, etc. Is this the best path? But I hate the conflicts with my bosses who can somehow sniff out my intelligence. And I sometimes feel like a ship that just stays docked all the time.",0

"2E and wide disparities in skills I was identified as gifted when I was in high school and a somewhat recent assessment put my IQ at 138. I was assessed because I was struggling to maintain passing grades, primarily in subjects that involved literature that I wasn't interested in or math. I would often pass subjects like history with As quite easily and I was always advanced in writing and reading comprehension when I was able to maintain focus for long enough. I was diagnosed with ADHD in the 99th percentile and my parents decided against putting me on medication because in the years before I entered school, there was a lot of discussion about the overuse of stimulant medication in children and I don't exactly fault them for that. From Kindergarten to 8th grade, I was able to skate through school without ever studying and earn straight As. I was even put in a program where I helped other kids with math because it came so easily and intuitively to me. I think it was called Math Masters if I remember correctly. The issue I'm experiencing is my present inability to perform well in algebra. I started out by skipping steps, which got me into some trouble with my instructors, so I ended up losing interest. Eventually, when I came across concepts that I didn't immediately understand, I shut down. I grew to hate math as a result. I had a series of unkind math teachers who responded negatively to me struggling and it's been a common theme ever since.  


Fast forward to today, I'm a student at a community college. I have highly advanced writing and reading comprehension skills, and language in general comes extremely easily to me. I speak three languages and I'm learning a fourth, comprehension comes extremely easily to me and I'm able to intuitively draw connections between distantly related languages that are seldom obvious to most learners. I can get As in classes that involve language arts, writing and history without studying for more than fifteen to thirty minutes a week. I've gotten As on papers that I felt needed significant revision and felt like rough drafts to me. On the other hand, I had to drop my intermediate algebra class because very little of it sticks. I can understand the concepts when they're being taught and do the problems in the homework assignments with little error, but when it comes to the exams, I'm often the last one still taking it and I perform abysmally. This disparity can be confusing to me at times when I think about my overall cognitive abilities and capabilities as a student. It's also confusing to me because I used to be excellent at math but I hit a brick wall. I can multiply random three digit numbers in my head and produce correct answers but when it comes to somewhat higher level math, I often get confused about what the instructor wants me to do and all the different steps and skills I need to apply not only don't stick, they bore me to death. I often wonder why it is that I, as a person who has certain strong mathematical abilities can also struggle in high school level math.  


I should mention that my study skills are still atrocious. When it comes to math classes, I'm so uninterested that I zone out almost immediately. I hate it. I would rather drink out of a latrine than factor a fucking polynomial. There's still this part of me that feels like it should come more intuitively to me so I get frustrated with myself when it doesn't. I want to get past this mental block or whatever it may be so I'm not limited in my educational prospects to areas that don't require high level math. Is this just a limitation I should work around? Have I reached the limit of my capability in math? Is this one of those areas where I just need to learn to buckle down and study like I've never studied before?",0
"Hi, I am new. Hi everyone. I am just introducing myself for now. I am newer to Reddit. I tested Gifted in 2004 I think. I was in Kindergarten. Heard the whole story a few of us did I’m sure about being excellent, saving the world, being capable of anything… Now we aren’t doing those things.

Well I hated that. I’ve been misunderstood my whole life and I didn’t even realize it until maybe last year or so. I mean, I knew things were different and frustrating but I didn’t understand how far on another level I was operating with my emotions, thoughts, and interests.

"Is it normal to have giftedness characteristics and not have an IQ of 130 or above? Hello.  A few years ago, I took a neuropsychological exam and through explanation and discussion, I explained to my examiner that I aligned myself with many of the same characteristics that I found through my own personal research on giftedness and through reflecting on my time in school. I believe I encountered some of the same struggles. While the Forer effect might have been at play during this period of self-reflection, I found solace in finding that these characteristics I found online perhaps reflected my own, leading me to believe for a period that I found the answer to why I felt different. After the test, I found that I was not gifted but tested in the high average range and did not test highly for ADHD or ADD, but she found that I tested highly for OCD and signs of autism and schizoaffective disorder. Although I am not gifted, is it normal for someone not in that level of mental cognition to have a lot of similar characteristics? Or am I fooling myself into believing I do? I understand that some disorders like autism exhibit similar characteristics to giftedness so perhaps the answer lies somewhere in the middle.",0

"Two path, no signs? II I‘ve been studying social sciences, business, finance and politics. I‘ve worked in politics, finance and business. Next step is a first senior corporate job. I‘ve been working on this for over 7 years.

I know that earning well is important for me because I have plenty of chronic autoimmune diseases.

I also know, that what I was planning on doing is FINE. I would live a FINE life.

I also know that my passion lies in fashion, art and design.

"Q. Someone mentioned “monetizing” their giftedness in another post… For certain specific things, people with extraordinary ability outsource this role to others.

"Is it too late for college ? Is this even a good reason to go ? Hello,

Like a lot of people here I've been at the ""roadblock"" where due to not having to study to score high, I never quite learned how to study, or any form of discipline or diligence whatsoever. As a result I kinda didn't do well at the end of high school and in my 2 years of college. I'm ashamed to say I don't know most things people 8 years younger than me probably know. (I'm 24 , almost 25)

Lately (read: for the past 2 years) I've been thinking about going back to college. But there are many problem's with this and I'm not sure what the correct decision is.

- I have a ""life"" where I am. I have a best friend that I love dearly. I have a job, a startup, a place to live. If I go back to college, I throw all of that away.

- I'm a software developer. I don't know how much things will have changed in 4 years. I love programming, I don't know if I can stay away from it for that long

- I have plans. Plans to buy a house. Plans with friends. Plans to learn a ton of things that require me not being in a dorm and having time to spare. Plans to travel to places. 

On top of that, the choice of university is daunting. My school of choice is St John's college. 

I've absolutely fallen in love with this school. I'm not exactly sure why, but the format of their classes is very appealing. The major turn off is that it's liberal arts. It's not a degree that will be useful or that will teach me things I want to know, rather I see it as a pathway to thinking better and learning to learn and be more disciplined.

At the same time, taking an actual curriculum on a subject I planned to learn on my own may be better...? I could go for engineering or biology or even better, physics.

And perhaps one of the biggest reason I want to go is that I feel I'm missing something. Some thing that I haven't experience yet that I need to .
I want to, for once in my life, struggle in the classes, force myself to learn, to pay attention, to improve, to strive to be the top of the class, to be in a club, to be more independent, to not have to worry about rent or work hours and just 100% fully commit on learning things. 

But as well, what if what I'm looking for is already here , and I'll only realize once so can't go back anymore ? What if I'm not missing anything?

"can you lose your giftedness/have a wrong assessment as a child I just wanted to know if you can lose your giftedness or miss your potential if you fuck up during your childhood/teenage years. I was diagnosed with being gifted in primary school, but the older I got, the more I think I was misdiagnosed or just lost my gift. I think the only thing I am really good at is cramming knowledge into my short term memory for tests.

I am shit at logic puzzles, but I obviously was good at them as a child for me to score something up in the 99.5th percentile in official giftedness tests. How can I get more stupid the older I get? 

Academically, I am still doing well in Uni so that's not an issue, but I think academics actually have nothing to do with intelligence except blunt memorization and I am studying music (where theory is not emphasized much).

TLDR:   
I'm supposed to finish my Master's thesis in April, and I don't know if I can do it. I don't want to let myself, my peers, my profs down, but I can't seem to take control of my life. If you've been in a similar situation, I would love to hear your story and words of encouragement. 

Longer version:

This gets a bit more ranty/personal. I don't know if I can consider myself gifted, but I always had an easy time learning things quickly (mainly things to do with emotional intelligence, psychology, philosophy, literature, etc.). I actually learned maths and sciences well too, but my brother excelled way more than I did (I couldn't get past the fact I was always inferior to him). It didn't help that my dad (since I can remember) attempted to teach me (us) material about 3-4 years in advance. I became completely non-responsive to doing his work, as he was a difficult teacher and often resorted to yelling at me and calling me stupid (my mom was no better). I'm a little conflicted on the ""gifted"" title because I was often considered dumb, but did well in school. 

In school, I hardly studied. I could get an A by learning everything from scratch the night before, which used to be a point of pride, but in reality it's ridiculously stressful, unsustainable, and causing me ill health. My study habits right now often follow this kind of pattern: I get the assignment, I'm overwhelmed, I feel like it's too much and I can't do anything, escapism is my friend, then the deadline comes and the anxiety of embarrassing myself outweighs the stagnation. Evidently, I never end up doing my best. And that sucks because, with this, I can't see a future for myself. I can't see myself attaining any of my goals.

Weirdly enough, if I try to do something in advance, I'm at a loss of what to do. Yet, I can clearly prioritize when there's no time left. 

I kind of feel like this is just who I am and I can't escape. I'm also ashamed of it and I feel like I should just be able to try harder and tough things out. 

PS - This is more of a side note, but I find it so interesting that my brother and I both ended up ""gifted"" (having an easy time in school (especially the case for him)) as well as went through/have similar disorders (depression, anxiety, eating disorders). 

(I am ok, by the way—I'm mostly just struggling with the escapism thing).",0
"I'm 38 and just found out I'm gifted In a very random turn of events, some old records were found by a colleague with my information on them, showing I had a gifted designation (the records were from school).

I had no idea. 

All I knew was that my parents considered skipping me ahead from K to Grade 2 but I decided that for social reasons, I wanted to stick with my friends. My mom said that the school wasn't very clear with communication (about the designation) but it appears as if I was being supported as a gifted kid, when I look back at my experiences. I have spent all weekend processing and reflecting and it all makes sense. I feel so validated and understood. It's like a whole new context to see myself in and that really excites me!

"The Paralyzed Athlete: Living with Giftedness and Adhd Hey there, 

I’ve been gifted with a sharp mind that loves nothing more than diving deep into complex, abstract ideas. Unfortunately, I’ve also been cursed with ADHD, which makes it extremely difficult to focus and keep my mind on track. It’s like being an athlete with a strong, muscular body but being paralyzed from the waist down. I can see the finish line, but I can’t get there no matter how hard I try. 

One of the things I struggle with most is feeling like I’m not living up to my intellectual potential. I love challenging myself and pushing my brain to its limits, but ADHD often holds me back. I’ll start working on a project or reading a book, and my mind will wander off to something else entirely. It’s frustrating to know that I’m capable of so much more but can’t seem to harness my own power. 

Another big challenge is finding a career that’s both stimulating and manageable. I’ve always been interested in fields like science and philosophy, but these subjects require a lot of focus and attention to detail. Meanwhile, jobs that don’t require as much brainpower can feel boring and unfulfilling. It’s a tough balance to strike, and I often feel like I’m stuck in a rut. 

But perhaps the most painful part of living with giftedness and ADHD is feeling like an outcast. Many people see me as intelligent and capable, but they don’t see the struggles that go on behind the scenes. Meanwhile, those who are truly gifted and successful often look down on me for not being able to keep up. It’s like I’m stuck in a no-man’s land between these two worlds 

I would love to hear your struggles if you relate and i'd also love it if you could share how medication has helped.",0

It has led me to consider I might be so as well. Now I know I can't really diagnose myself when it comes to these things so I won't go around saying that I am gifted.

But let's say I am, should I do anything with that knowledge? Should I look further into it? Or should I just leave it be as it won't really help me in any way?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",0

"Am I stupid or am I gifted and the others are not getting it? Hi guys,

Am I stupid or am I gifted and the others are not getting it? Look at some of the examples below and try to judge if my plans make sense.  
In general I have like 10 years of developing campaign plans. I have read 18 books with a total of 1000s of pages. I have spent 1000€ on surveys to gain a deeper understanding on certain details. In detail:  
I have insight from the books which factors explain the media reporting.   
I have insight from the books and scientific literature which factors explain how media reporting is processed in the brain to create certain opinions and how manipulation is at play. To do this, I have read into psychological concepts and conducted own research.  
I have insight from the books into the theory of planning effective campaigns. And have planned many campaigns so far (read below).

Does that make me gifted or an expert on campaigning?

&#x200B;

 **------ EXAMPLES (pick one or two at random) ------**

**Example 0: Am I gifted in math?**  
Well in School I had like straight As in Maths and Physics. Is that exceptional? For me it's normal. I then went on to study Physics, where I barely came by (scored a ""pass"" on first math exam). Well I also did not like to study hard, maybe it was that. But well I never was exceptionally gifted in comparison to other physics students.

Well then I switched to economics where I scored 15 points out of 15 point on the math course exam. It's the top 1% of economics students, which should have a higher IQ than normal. I also did an online (free) test where I scored a 130 IQ on math, but less so on other IQ topcis, so average IQ was more like 110 or so. After graduating economics bachelor I went on to work as a statistician. Combining the information, I probably am gifted in the field of mathematics but not over the top gifted?

**Maybe Asperger explains the high math IQ**  
Also I did an online test on Asperger and almost all these free Asperger test say it would be likely I have it. (except the one test where it is about recognizing emotional states in faces, I can do that). That would explain why parts of my IQ is elevated, but not all. Also would explain difficulties in relationships. But it's not terrible. I have some friends I talk to and play online games with. I have good contacts with my colleagues. I worked on my social skills. It takes some brainpower to come up with the socially appropriate response, but I think I can manage it. You have to look for clues in the faces of people, like are they looking away, looking distracted, how are they talking, and also factor in what would be a ""normal average"" response. But I don't have not so much interested in ""small talk"". But I've worked on that too, I was much less interested 7 years ago.

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 1: LGBT Youth support (fail)**  
So I have been interested in politics for a long time now. My first topic of interest was LGBT youth depression and suicide. I crunched the statistical numbers and I found out, that the problem here where I live is not that people don't think LGBT youth should not be supported. They simply were not aware of the problem. Then I found out that the problem of lacking awareness is that something like LGBT youth suicide is not really interesting in the media cycle. It is depressing and once reported loses it's newsworthy status and interest takes a nose dive. So I searched for ways to attract genuine media attention to the topic through the back door. I found out that if we combine the topic ""LGBT youth"" with ""gay soccer player"" then suddenly interest would skyrocket. This is shown by past coming outs where it was the nationwide headline in the newspapers. You would need 100s of millions of $ to replicate the attention with ads, I calculated and I think that should be the goal metric to solve the problem. But somehow I could'nt convince other organizations working on it of this? I don't think they understood the strategy? Or they were just showing narcissistic fake compassion where you pose to ""work for the good cause"" but you actually just showing off how great of a person you are and how much you ""care"". So I did it myself. I myself created one of the biggest LGBT social media channels in my country (like a few thousand followers) working with the proposed strategy. Still no one would join the effort. Also, in addition later I found an alternative way towards the objective: The relevant literature on campaigning like the Core Curriculum of the Center for applied nonviolent Actions and Strategies (Capter one ""A Vision of Tomorrow"") and Chapter 3 of activist Popovis book ""Protest"", you find out, that you need a large vision that captivates whole of society and not a special topic, that almost no one cares for. So creating an alliance to combat mobbing in general would be the right strategy, here the interest of pupil, parent, womens, LGBT, disabled, migrant organizations would converge and they could stand with a united voice to protect all our kids. Explained this to people, did'nt work either. Again: Don't they understand the underlying principles of the literature so I need to start there? I thought it would be obvious once applied and I don't need to circle back to the theory?! Or again: fake narcicisstic compassion at work? Or did I overlook something and the solution is not as great as it seems? What's wrong here?

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 2: development aid (fail)**  
Again, I was looking at the relevant literature (""poor economics"") from Nobel Literate Banerjee. Turns out development aid is incredibly ineffective. Read a bunch of other research papers (like 25 to 40) too. Goal is to prevent hunger and starvation. Solution is raising education levels. Each year of general education on average rises income enough to stop hunger if you crunched the statistical numbers (average calorie deficit, price to close calorie deficit with cheap food, % of income increase that is spent on chap food). Also health interventions (deworming meds, vaccination, breastfeeding, iron supplements) have an extremely high ROI as the preven sickness costs of 100s of dollars (meds, loss of work). You can accomplish these health interventions with health education. So new Goal is to reduce price to spread general and health education as low as possible. Current price is about 200$ per year for schooling children and basically unattainable for adults in rural settings.

So if we program an free education app, we cut down the price down to free / 0.5 dollars to spread the app. What I mean is: You can work with the school system, NGOs on the ground, stars to advertise the app for free. If you run of that strategy you can run paid ads that reach 1000 people for 0.5 Dollars. The cost to acquire and help one user is pushed down from 200$ per year to 0.5 dollar for a lifetime. Free user recommendations not even factored in. And as 45% of the population in development countries already have a smartphone and 80% will have towards the end of the decade, this means we can provide education almost for free, while the upside for people is like 100 dollars per year. So the ROI is like 1000X after 10 years. Better then everything else. 5-10X is like the standard that is considered decent. 30X is considered very great. We are at 1000X. Not saying this is easy to pull of. But should'nt we invest really serious resources to see if this is possible if the potential reward is 1000X? What am I missing here? Talked to CEO of one laptop per child program, the biggest e-learning developing aid program in the world to date. She should now. She said it's interesting. There was no criticisms from her. Only thing she said is read a book which talks about ""deschooling society"" so the only thing she said was: Be aware not to force people into rigid education rituals, but the app would be not rigid but provide the education for everyone who wants it for free.

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 3: Corona politics (fail)**  
Ok I am getting into hot water here. So during peak corona there were two sides not talking to each other: Side one: 50% of us are all going to hospital of the virus if we get the virus. We have to fight virus at all costs. Side two: The virus is not dangerous. This is just a conspiracy to enforce the Great Reset on us. No one wants the corona restrictions. This is turning into a dictatorship.   
And I was more on the camp of the restrictions were to much. But not at all in the ""great reset conspiracy camp"". So, again I crunched the numbers / statistics on this. Turn out, majority of the population was ok with the restrictions, while some wanted more and some less restrictions. And turns out that fear of the virus was actually quite widespread, explaining the wide support of the restrictions.

So, again,  I read the relevant literature on campaigning, like the Core Curriculum of the Center for applied nonviolent Actions and Strategies (Chapter one ""A Vision of Tomorrow"") and Chapter 3 of activist Popovis book ""Protest"", you find out, that you need a large vision that captivates whole of society. You are focusing on issues were everyone agrees upon to advance your course. And if you read the very first chapter of ""The Politics of Nonviolent Action"" from Gene Sharp of his 900 pages opus dei on nonviolent action you read that you need to cut off the power of the opponent at its source. The source of the power of the opponent was clearly fear.   
Combining both concepts and conducting opinion research, I figured out that the common ground was ""understanding the restrictions"". Like 80%+ wanted transparency, they wanted to understand the restrictions and have clarity when a restriction would be suspended and when it would be in place. And a majority did not understand the restrictions. So you would pick the most unpopular restriction and simply demand to explain what metric exactly was crossed that pushed the danger to far and what metric exactly needs to crossed again to lift the restriction. Not explaining this would be highly unpoplar and reduce support for the measure. Explaining this would reduce fear on both sides (fear of a corona dictatorship and of the virus) and widen the common ground of both sides. Follow up demand would be to make the crossed line metric comparable to heavy flu seasons. Not saying this would have solved everything. But saying that this is much more effective then the one side shouting ""dictatorship"" and the other ""your irresponsible"". It never got to the underlying core issue that way. Again, tried to explain this to the organisators of the corona protest. Barely got them to understand it. They half-heartetly deployed the strategy one week, but no follow up next week. Next weeks everything back to normal like ""demanding all restrictions to fall immediatly"", although the literature says that's not how you do it. You politicize a small issue that you can win to build momentum towards the big goal.  Again: Don't they understand the underlying principles of the literature so I need to start there? I thought it would be obvious once applied and I don't need to circle back to the theory?! Or did I overlook something and the solution is not as great as it seems? What's wrong here?

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 4: Help to make peace in ucraine war (fail)**  
Ok again getting into hot water here twice. So, again I was crunching the statistical data on this topic. I found out that in general public support for the actions taken by my government is above 50% (close to 50% or as high as 70%). I also found out that the reason for this is widespread fear of russia (80% having fear of Russian aggression). Again, the literature (more details in example 3) suggest not to campaign on divisive issues and cut the power of the opponent at it's source. Yet, all the peace movement does is running on divisive issues and not attacking the power sources of the opponent but interacting with the product of this power structure (the public opinion the power structure has created). I think I have asked them and they don't know about the nonviolent action literature.

It seems like in general the organizations neither have crunched the data on public support nor have read the nonviolent action literature. So they have no realistic model of the problem and no realistic model of the strategy to solve it. Are they just copying what everyone else is doing? Just following the standard template and not wasting any thoughts on what the optimum solution would be?!

Anyway, so again the rule is not to make the big end demand but make a small demand on a non-divisive point to gain momentum for the campaign. In our case this would be demanding a newspaper to apologize for the weapons of mass destruction lie. According to my survey, 95% of the population supports this. If this demand does not get met, why think a more divisive demand would? Or you could analyse an article on the ucraine war for biases with a scoring system and demand the biases to be cleared. Again, this would arouse almost no protest from the other side, as it identifies a common ground which is: There should be fair and unbiased reporting in the press. No one argues against that. If the demand is not met in private malings, you would move on to public protest. If that doesn't work, you start a boycott. Especially pushing the advertisers away from the press by boycotting advertisers  that don't obey the boycott. This can hurt the opponent extremely as they make like 50% of their revenue with ads. Risking significant parts of their business for biased reporting doesn't seem likely. Repeat until demand is met and first victory is scored. Well accurate reporting would not mean peace right away. But it would increase the likelihood and prevent additional oil added to the fire by biased media reporting.

**Am I gifted in politics? Example 5: migration politics (fail)**  
(Triple hot water.) In my country there are two sides on migration politics. One side: Let's welcome all refugees and be open and tolerant. Migration critics are nazis. Other side: No more migration this will be the end of our culture. Again, the strategy would be not to take a divisive stance but to identify common ground to advance the campaign. Turns out it's not too hard. Reading the handbook on nonviolent campaigns by war resisters international, reveals framing of your goal is important and can make a huge difference in acceptance of the goal. 

Having invested some money into a survey, I found out that when asking people if refugees should be helped near their homeland at a safe place or at our country, 70%+ say it should be near their homeland. So actually, the divisiveness goes away if you approach it right. But politicans and activists still say they are ""against migration"". Saying it this way, only 30% of the population supports you, while being in favor of helping near their homeland gets you 70%+ support. Why would you frame the issue so bad? And it gets worse: I don't want to get into detail but saying you are ""against migration"" can really easily gets you placed into the nazi category. (Which is a logical mistake as 30% of the population has that opinion and they are not all nazis.)",0
"How do you ""think/feel"" about autism and ADHD? Last year I started going to a psychiatrist to get ADHD pills, and I got an autism diagnosis, but I'm having a hard time coming with terms with these diagnoses. I'm highly skeptical about the validity of these disorders, mostly on a personal level, but sometimes even when thinking about other people.

&#x200B;

When I first went to my psychiatrist I had spent weeks learning more about ADHD and I felt like getting a diagnosis for it would really help me. As a small child I was lucky that I got stimulated by my parents and got my mind engaged, but eventually things changed and I became ""lazy"". I've always guilted myself for not actively trying harder as a teenager, so finding out about ADHD made sense and brought me temporary relief - ""it's not that I didn't try harder, my brain just didn't know better"", or something along these lines.

I never got a formal diagnosis of ADHD, I just said why I thought I had it to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me a stimulant. So I always questioned if it was ""fair"" to get the pills, if I really needed them. I eventually decided to quit it, but apparently I got way moodier than when I was on them and my life got messier. My mom had an argument with me about it and now I'm taking them again, but only when I have to make chores or do college/work stuff I find very boring.

For my autism diagnosis, I don't really ""remember"" why I decided to get it. After thinking so much about it, I deconstructed any self-convincing reasons I could have for it. An online friend of mine got a diagnosis last year, and after talking a bunch to him and making my research I thought it made sense that I'm autistic too. So I scheduled an assesment with a trusting evaluator, and she concluded I'm actually autistic in my first session, just with an interview and a questionnaire.

I got quite excited about the autism diagnosis but this feeling got quickly dilluted too. I didn't want my parents to know about this, so I didn't have anyone to tell about how I acted during my childhood other than myself during the assessment. I wouldn't say I lied when talking about it, but I also don't think I really looked and behaved as an autistic kid. The evaluator said it was fine that I didn't have someone else in my assesment because she was really sure I'm actually on the spectrum, but I don't know how to feel about this. I feel like I cheated, if this makes sense.

&#x200B;

I don't feel comfortable saying I have ADHD or that I'm autistic. I can't not see ADHD as something other than a social issue, I can't see it as a personal issue I have. I just take stimulants because they give me an advantage and it would be silly of me not to use this in my favor.

And I don't know why I should consider myself autistic, I don't have a clear reason for this or any advantage to get. I can relate to traits but I don't know how much these impact my life negatively. I'm also pretty good at social interactions, even though there's a bunch of average interaction things I ""don't comprehend"". I thought an autism diagnosis could explain my problems but I don't see how being an ""extroverted autistic"" is better than just being a ""quirky smart person"".

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm mostly just venting here and looking for peace of mind. I'd like reading about how someone here thinks of these ""disorders"" since they're strongly related to giftedness and if/how you feel comfortable with these labels, how they help you or something like this.",0
"How do you deal with frustrations with other drivers? Hi! I'm not sure if this is specifically a 'gifted' issue, but here it goes. I've had my driver's license since 2013 but I've been growing more and more frustrated with other drivers (especially since actually having a car since last year). 

I stick to the rules and try to drive as considerate as possible, while there are many drivers who don't keep enough distance, drive way too fast, don't use their blinkers, merge into my lane without enough distance (so I have to break), pass me on my right (which is not allowed here) when I keep a safe distance with the car in front of me. It causes dangerous situations and frustrates the heck out of me. 

I don't understand why people create dangerous situations and why they don't stick to the rules of the game. But getting frustrated myself is A) unpleasant for me and B) influences my driving. I know I can't change how other people drive, so I'll have to change my reaction to it. (Just to be clear, this reaction is inward/internal, I don't express this to other road users.)

Does anyone recognize this? And how do you deal with it? How do you process the feeling of frustration? Or do you distance yourself from it? Any help is very welcome! :)",0

its a generally easy course (i'm not the only one who thinks it's easy... everyone says its laughable) and the multiple choice was fine but gosh i struggle so much on short answer questions *all the time*. with short answer the questions are open ended and literally could be answered with so many different course concepts.

my school suggested i might have a reading disability because of this but i don't understand how thats the case when i literally taught myself to read at age 3 and have no issues with phonetics.  i already have accommodations but i have to get an assessment done because of this issue to see if i need more support. but that still doesn't explain me nearly failing the worlds easiest course. i understand and remember everything so well. idk what to do anymore man this always happens every exam the short answers are ruining my GPA :(",0

"Frustrations about misunderstanding conversations and not getting to share my thoughts I just had a quick call for a potential freelance gig in my niche that would pay big bucks. The problem is that I had difficulties understanding what the interview questions were because I have trouble processing things quickly due to being 2e.

I'm worried that my answers were off base from misunderstanding the questions. Usually the clients I've worked with just communicate over message so I don't run into this problem.

It's not just this though, it happens all the time. By the time I understand what's going on, people have moved on and I'm stuck with really good thoughts that I never had the chance to share. This time was just more high-stakes unfortunately.

I'm sure this isn't fully unique to being 2e- what do you do when a convo has moved on but you still have thoughts about it? / do you get frustrated with yourself at the possibility that you went on unrelated tangents?

"My gifted childhood friend gave up on everything and is wasting his life. I'm writing in this sub, so maybe someone can relate and have more insights or advice.

This gifted software engineer friend \[30M\] was known as the genius in high school and college, getting almost 100% grades, was a local chess champion, good-looking, very kind, and likable, and had well-paid jobs. It seems like nothing could go wrong.

Two years ago, he quit his job, saying he was ""traumatized"" and ""had enough,"" and moved back to his parent's house. This is not the first time he has quit suddenly, but he used to get another job immediately afterward. This time it was different. He depleted his savings, living off his parents now, barely going out, and not even trying to improve his condition.

He stopped meeting friends and had no girlfriend. When I asked him what are you doing in this void you are creating for yourself? He mentions books, music, hobbies, the internet, and games.

His mom called me a few times to discuss this and asked me to talk more to him. She tells me, ""if staying home makes him happy, then why not? but it doesn't make sense. I could see he's not happy,"" and she's worried he's giving up on everything and is wasting his life.

When I talk to him, he is still the same bright person, always retains his wit, and has a solid argument for everything, and it is very difficult to understand where all of this is going.

I asked his mom whether she is willing to put some healthy pressure on him, like setting a deadline or planning for him to move and force him to change and take action. She said, ""never ever would I kick my son out."" She thinks he is emotionally soft and sensitive and would suffer immensely.

Here are the main unhealthy thinking patterns that I noticed:

* He thinks therapy is a waste of time and a way to assimilate and integrate adults. He said they only care about money and partially blamed capitalism for ruining everything and hacking the greedy nature of humans.
* He tried two therapists before, and he didn't like them and described them as patronizing and superficial.
* He told me how he knew how depression screening works and could get any outcome he wanted (which I believed because he was not diagnosed). 
* He thinks most SNRI interventions are hiding the problem under the rug instead of dealing with the root causes that make people feel like shit.
* He gave up on having a corporate job; he tells me: ""you don't understand; it's painful to witness the greed, inefficiency, lies, and unreasonable decisions made daily in a corporate structure."" He mentions how he witnessed evil people and sociopaths climb the corporate ladder, and the smart ones doing the heavy lifting are barely getting by. He told me, ""I didn't wanna be one of those people.""He goes on deep theory rants that I don't remember well, but I know he reads a lot (That's all he does right now.)
* Another strange behavior was that he didn't ask for unemployment benefits or insurance even though he was easily eligible. He states that he refuses to get this help from a failed society and that they make it difficult and embarrassing on purpose to apply.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",0

"Help! Tips for a 2E kiddo?? My son is 7 and is 2E.  (Gifted with ADHD)  I am often at a loss as to how to help him get what he needs and also not go insane.

His interests have fluctuated a bit in his lifetime, but are consistently more math/science related.  He is advanced at reading but dislikes it.  If he MUST read he prefers “non fiction” books.  (I found him in bed the other day voluntarily reading a book about physics and next to him was a book about pre algebra and an Ernest Hemingway).  

His most recent interest is in engineering, which we want to encourage.  The problem is that he’s engineering things by being… well… wasteful and destructive.  Entire Costco size boxes of bandaids, jumbo bags of rubber bands, bulk packages of packing tape, any cardboard he can find (board game boxes are a favorite, despite plenty of access to Amazon boxes), aluminum foil, kitchen utensils, feminine pads and tampons, toilet paper and paper towels, ALL the paper in the printer….  And now he’s disassembling furniture to use.

I mean, I want him to thrive!  God knows he’s bored at school…he complains they’re just doing subtraction and he’s into exponents and playing with pre algebra. The ADHD complicates everything as he’s all over the place, has trouble with focus, and goes from one giant mess to another.  Our life is…chaos.

"Inventors and ADHD Hey!
I was playing around with «chatGPT», and to my suprise i found out a lot of the big inventors and general inventors been speculated to have ADHD.
Tesla, Einstein, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Da Vinci, Edison, Galileo Galilei, J.K Rowling, Bill Gates, Gurdon, Pasteur, Stephen Hawking, Benjamin Franklin, Newton, Alexander the Great and a lot more people. 

Again; many of them have not been diagnosed, if any, but they displayed characteristics that are overlapping with ADHD (Rowling have been diagnosed). I’ve read a lot of articles that takes on giftedness and overexcitability, that gifted people can display a lot of ADHD-characteristics because of that + general boredom.

So What do you guys think? ADHD, overexcitability, boredom + drive and energy, just pure curiosity, high energy with a really creative side or anything else? - People with ADHD have been displayed as more creative and innovative then the general population.

If ADHD i was thinking that they had a bigger grip because of the ability to hyperfocus, their high energy, tend to be highly creative and innovative, resilience, conversational skills and spontaneity. That combined with high intellignece could make wonders.


Also, i am not really suprised, but rather sad. I didn’t get a lot of women listed, and in general listed as inventors. I Wonder How many amazing women-brains we have missed out on through out history. - (not suprised as in the way women have been viewed, treated and the gender roles that have been displayed through out history)

"Giftedness and 'extreme' music/art taste Hi everyone,

Gifted coming from a family of gifted persons, with highly gifted kids and so on. Working / teaching in University-like environment, well adapted although always felt like an outcast.

My question relates to music, but may be extended to art in general. In term of context, I tend to 'hook' very quickly on some subjects / intellectual challenges which often turn obsessional. Very difficult to unhook.

This is particularly true about music, where I slightly drifted from (heavy) metal to more extreme genres ( black metal, melodic BM...). I love the hidden beauty and delicateness behind this apparent wall of noise and brutality. By the way, I also absolutely love symphonic music and especially Mozart's operas.

I would like to know how frequent it is that gifted people turn to extreme forms of music and art and intellectualize the hidden beauty they find in them ?",0

"An extremely practical example of the importance of first acknowledging how the system truly works - getting a job. I'm sure many of you will remember my post from yesterday about accepting people where they actually are. Here's an extremely practical example of the importance of that (even if only for selfish reasons).

I had an initial interview which is normally conducted through an HR recruiter. Now, my resume contains amazing things for an accountant. I've automated half of my job away before. I served in the Marine Corps. I've solved problems that no one had the answer to, and no one knew who had the answers or where they could be found. Consequently, my resume looks amazing *if* you are an accountant.

This won't come as a surprise, but HR people... aren't accountants. They rely on ""Applicant Tracking Systems"" to choose resumes for them. After I gave the internal recruiter all of that information, he proceeded to ask me about things that were so basic, I would never think to mention them. After all, every accountant does a month-end close process. It's like asking a nurse if they have any experience with *looks at paper* ""patients.""

Now, here's the rub. I have really high-level accomplishments to put on my resume. If I didn't, what would my resume say? That's right! ""Performed bank reconciliations, monthly account reconciliations, variance analysis, etc."" That would get me through the HR process though, so in this case, our ingrained belief is that meritocracy leads to accomplishment, but unless you first acknowledge and focus on the system as it is, you may get passed up for a mediocre candidate because they accidentally conformed to the system better.

I have quite a fascination with the behavior of neurotypical people, and I've made several posts about their behavior and my inability to cope with it. I find the replies are often mixed. I think about half of this sub reflexively stands up for people in general because they automatically think of any negative discussion as being tantamount to bullying.

Look, I'm 33 now. I didn't always have this annoyance with the inefficiency of society even though I had every reason to be. It gnaws at you over time. One thing I've learned in the last 15 years is that the step after learning known systems is to start examining systems with a lot of mythology built around them. I strongly believe that's how you go from 90th percentile to 99th percentile.

People are a really good example of this. I believe this reflexive ""standing up"" for people is inefficient. If you want to help people, you have to meet them where they are. Being unwilling to admit the extent of their faults or examine their causes is not helpful. It's tantamount to ignoring the problem.

I hesitate to put this here, but I'm becoming very disappointed in this sub. I know IQ doesn't correlate with conscientiousness extremely strongly, but in a technology-driven world, high-IQ individuals (who are usually open to experience) are the most capable of changing things. Instead, I see a complete lack of pragmatism.

The general advice to cope with stress seems all so trivial and unsuitable.

"I'm struggling to find motivation to improve my cognition after abuse Let's just start with the point. I was severely abused as a child for 18 years. I was moderately malnourished, medically neglected, lacked an education completely (wasn't sent to school) and physically/emotionally abused daily

I'm 19, I just moved out last year and I have a tremendous amount of trauma that's manifested in mood disorders as well as possibly some more serious disorders like BPD, schizophrenia, and DID. I don't have these disorders fully but I can see there's a high chance of development because of heritability and because I'm showing prodromal symptoms.

Could these factors have severely impacted my intelligence? 

Intelligence is extremely important to me. I frequently feel motivated to take steps to cure my mental illnesses with the hopes of drastically improving cognition but in the back of my head there's a voice of impostor syndrome telling me I'm struggling cognitively because I was never particularly gifted in the first place. Maybe in the 130 range at most but not in the 150-160 range.

I don't know why I feel intuitively that I am or how to move beyond these doubts.

If I believed there were something worth restoring I'd be very motivated to do so but when I have even a glimmer of hope it's like a drop of blood in a pool of sharks

On paper, every aspect of intelligence measured by IQ tests is influenced by severe and chronic stress. I know that to some extent my IQ would be higher if I had been educated and if my brain could have developed properly instead of being on survival mode. If I didn't have to shut myself down all the time to avoid the pain of existing with the memories I have and the vicious voices of anxiety. Thing is, I'm not sure how much. 

As my mental illnesses have progressed, I've seen tangible decreases in my cognition. For example, as of last year I can't visualize images in my head even though I was able to visualize very well before that.

I don't feel that I exist most of the time. My sensory experiences fluctuate. I know I'm dealing with severe dissociation.

I know that this could affect intelligence. Because I am not certain I constantly ruminate over the possibility that it's not true


What I'm not looking for is predictable advice. ""Go to therapy"" ""take medications"" ""stop worrying so much about intelligence"" I've already considered all of these which is why I'm making this post.

If you have any knowledge on 
a) the effects of severe stress on intelligence 
b) evidence that scores/intelligence can or cannot change drastically 
c) personal experience with this 
d) genuinely helpful methods of dealing with impostor syndrome and pathological self doubt

"I cannot cope with the neurotypical need for patterns and rituals. I've realized this is a major issue in my life. Nothing makes me more angry than this. There are a series of rituals in society, and neurotypicals cannot cope when they see any departure from the pattern they're used to. I assume this is common to gifted people, but I see the ritual and the purpose of the ritual, and I can depart from the ritual easily to better address the purpose using another method.

One example is renting an apartment in a new city. They have two-pet limits and don't see the underlying issue of preventing animal hoarding and being a disturbance to your neighbors. They also need to see two recent paystubs. I took a sabbatical, so they have trouble seeing an income of $90,000 as being able to pay the rent on a place that would otherwise require $40,000. Some places will take a bank account balance, but they want you to have $25,000 in the account. Here's the crazy part - they won't even take all six months' worth of rent upfront in many cases. I say again, some places have concerns even when I pay them the entire balance of the lease upfront. I am, however, allowed to use paystubs from a job I obviously won't have when I move, and since I have three pets, most people are just telling me to lie about how many animals I have.

"Choosing a school for my 5 year old. Hello everyone!

My 5 year old absolutely loves Math and is doing extremely well doing high number multiplication. Thanks to advice from this group, she's being doing Beast Academy and really enjoys it! 

We live in Calgary and Kindergarten is not mandatory. She's currently in Montessori and will start Grade 1 in the fall.

Unfortunately, the public schools where we live  don't offer any support/challenges for gifted kids.

We applied to a public charter school for gifted children, and she's been preselected. We'll find out at the end of the month if she gets in. The downside is that many kids have also an underlying code besides their giftedness (ADD, ADHD or on the spectrum), which I worry might impact her learning and making friends.

We also applied to French Immersion, and she did get in. It's a great school and as much as I like her to learn a second language, I'm afraid it will impact her Math as it's taught in French (she doesn't know any).

Any advice would be appreciated!

1. Has a specific executive functioning/social-emotional aspect, targeted to gifted kids' needs
2. Creates a community for parents and families to connect
3. Gives students a chance to work at their pace and excel as far as they need to 
4. Groups students by ability, not age
5. Pairs the best educators with adequate training in working with gifted kids with the students who need it
6. Allows students to work on passion projects

He has made some friends at his current school, but is absolutely not challenged academically. We've supplemented his schooling with coding, robotics, the Johns Hopkins CTY program, etc.. We found out last week and academy that normally only takes middle/high schoolers would be opening up to his grade next year, and are waiting to hear about acceptance. 

What opinions would you have regarding moving him to a school that has a ton of resources and caters to gifted, vs. keeping him where he is at comfortably socially but unchallenged academically?",0
"Talk to me about asynchronous development in young kids My possibly gifted but untested Kindergartener (almost age 6) is having a really rough year so far and we’ve been trying to find ways to best support them. 

We think they may be gifted for a few reasons both related to how advanced they are academically but also they’re very advanced verbally and have been asking really interesting questions since before age 2. For example they started asking questions and having conversations about what happens when you die around age 2.5. They can read books at a level which is more typical of 1st/2nd grade. Adults have often commented to us about their unusual precociousness. Both me and my spouse were in gifted programs and academically advanced throughout school and college so it’s not too surprising.   

Behaviorally though, the year has been a struggle. They struggle a lot with outbursts, since they often have ideas while the teacher is talking and they tend to be impulsive about shouting them out. They’re also not great at respecting classmates’ physical space. The phrase  “class clown” has been floated around as sometimes they get a bit out of control and start looking for more attention. The teacher has also said they aren’t as good at navigating social conflict as peers.

Together, these issues have led to a lot of problems because they’re complaining about being so bored and being more fidgety as a result. They hate “school math” and this has been the worst behavior time because they’re ahead and it moves too slowly. We got Beast Academy at home and they love that. 

All of this is making me feel like school isn’t designed for my kid. Their self confidence has started to be impacted and I’m not sure if we should consider this asynchronous development as part of giftedness or not. Will it even out? Do we need a different school environment? Should I be so worried?

Edit: The reason we worry about their self esteem is the school is big on their behavior point system and they are often sent to the principal’s office to chat. They like talking to the principal but don’t like being obviously “in trouble” all the time.",0
"Best countries for the gifted For context I’m bringing up gender and ethnicity, only because if people react badly to gifted men, it feels as though these attributes worsen being able to climb up in society to a place where I can gain autonomy.

I live in Asia where it’s relatively patriarchical, we don’t have as strong of a feminist culture here but women for the most part are treated well in the workplace (just maybe more invisible / favours pleasant, agreeable women).

I’ve also lived in the States briefly where feminism / diversity narrative is very strong outwardly but as a foreigner and Asian, again I feel invisible or people stare as though I have two heads when they find out my personality doesn’t suit my gentle image.

I’ve tested for giftedness across different channels, and am also possibly on the spectrum but I don’t want to find out because the information to me is useless and doesn’t remove my challenges.

I’m thinking of moving abroad, after a few failed workplaces. Where would be a good country or workplace situations or jobs where a gifted, highly pragmatic, “speaks literally / speaks their mind”, non-caucasian woman might thrive?

I’m also highly disagreeable, not on purpose, but because I often see from A to Z faster and am talking about Z when some people are still talking about J. This is not bragging (I thought I was delusional earlier on) but only believed in myself when I achieved results multiple times.

I need a role with a lot of autonomy or where people collaborate but work with efficiency rather than ego. I also work in tech and am always the only woman in the room. I am ok with solo roles too. I’m just exhausted from feeling like an alien or getting dragged down by jealous colleagues.",0

"I Feel Like a Vitamin D Deficiency Ruined My Life This only got cured last year. So I suspect that I was Vitamin D deficient from around 15 years old. Like I can only remember very little from that time period. It feels like amnesia or a blackout. Very concerning when stuff from before is extremely vivid and clear. I remember feeling like I was in cognitive decline. I couldn't remember anything. I managed to lose my phone at University and information wouldn't go in like it used to. Like I remember before the defiencey that I could commit something to long term memory by staring at it and reciting it a few times. While I was deficient I could barely remember anything. It was really embarrassing. Particularly when I was always praised as this gifted child with this exceptional memory.

It made me very depressed and suicidal. Now that I'm back again to what I was. I'm not in a haze and I can commit stuff to memory without trying like I used to.

However my issue now is that all my most important schooling happened while I was handicapped by something outside my control. Sure I have a University degree but it's not a final grade I'm proud of. I work a job just above minimum wage, it's not something that you need to be highly educated to do but I like it.
Though eventually I feel like my interest in using my ""powers"" to do extra, make stuff more efficient.ect is going to get old. Then I'm scared as to who is going to hire me? How am I going to get a better paid job without the degree with the poor grade. Worries me.",0
"how to figure out giftedness besides regular IQ testing? is there a standardized procedure to figure out giftedness? an official giftedness magistry™ that decides that? 🤔

I don't consider myself gifted, I think I'm above average, with very strong competences in some areas, but people who are gifted keep pointing out they think I'm too.

I don't come from a family where giftedness was a thing. working class parents, alcoholism, abuse, that sort of thing.

I've done IQ tests in the past, and were above average, but not immensely.

so my issue is: numbers. I have (self diagnosed) dyscalulia, I suspect it's required through trauma, I have a lot of math trauma, so numbers are shit for me. 
(I still can't stand to use quad paper. I often blank when numbers are involved, especially under stress. 
idk if it's purely trauma related, cause I can, with a regulated nervous system and no time pressure, and noone around, come up with mathematical equations for practical purposes, but i freak out when someone's watching)
I have cptsd too, that's officially diagnosed, so, anyways. 

how does one find out if I one's gifted, if regular IQ tests are a triggering no go due to their numbers and geometric pattern detection focus? 
can I email the official giftedness magistry™ for assessment or how does one figure that out?",0
"Identity issues I know I am gifted i have no confusion about that.  I am annoyed i only found a few years ago (i worked it out) but my real confusion is around whether i also have autism.   I was assessed a few months ago and was told no, but I am not convinced. I mean I am 45 and probably masked. Many people look at me like I am a total freak when they meet me and run away, the more i become who i am the more friends i have lost.  I don't know if this is just a transition thing as I am changing or whether the real me is just really repellant to be around or both.  People either love me or hate me and there is zero in between.  I find it easier to get along with autistic people and we also get along like a house on fire a lot of the time. I find some autistic men to be the male version of me.

"Not a high IQ-level, but recognizing other characteristics I (27F) am going through a hard time where I feel the need to understand myself better. In that quest I've found that I recognize myself in some typical charcteristics of giftedness: being HSP, perfectionist, strong sense of justice and a critical mindset. Not a bit but a lot. (Side note: I also recognize myself in some ADD-characteristics.) 

Now, I'm starting therapy in two weeks because I'm struggling a lot. Some struggles are:

\- Always tired, even though I sleep enough and have my blood checked (it's fine).   
\- Feeling alienated, misunderstood, people call me intense.   
\- I start many projects, but finish almost none.   
\- When I find something really interesting I become hyperfocused and obsessed. I can devour difficult books in a few evenings if I find it interesting. But the moment something bores me, I find it extremely hard to focus on it, understand it or motivate myself to do/study it.   
\- I think way too much and then I start thinking about my thinking ... My thoughts distract me a lot and consume all mu energy.   
\- I hate small talk. I can do it, perfectly even, because I adapted. But it exhausts and bores me. But deep conversations give me energy. I can dive deep into a conversation much quicker than people appreciate.   
\- I'm that irritating 'I told you so' person: I see what's wrong long before others see it and am 90% of the times confirmed in what I foresaw.   
\- I love learning, I'm an autodidact, but I have difficulties learning something that someone else has imposed on me. When something \*must\* be done, I loose interest. It's got to do with not accepting authoroty that easily.  
\- As a kid I did very well at (primary) school, I understood things faster than others and my level of reading was top 3 in the class. But I lost motivation to study when I started high school, my results started to drop and I had to change schools eventually to follow a course of a lower level. There were no courses that I found interesting enough to really want to work for it. And the fact that maths was so important in E-ve-ry course was very demotivating.   
\- I adapt other people's emotions and find it difficult to hold my sense of self in a bigger group.  
\- I feel as if I'm talented and gifted in things that aren't appreciated in our society: high EQ, intrapersonal intelligence, philosophical thinking, creativity. But not in the things that are highly valued as rational thinking, mathematics ...   


This is a nonextensive list and includes only my struggles, not things that I experience as positive. 

When I read about giftedness I recognize myself a lot. But the problem is, I've done an IQ-test (WAIS-IV-NL) a few months back and my result was 116. Far from 130. On some level this score feels right as I don't think I'm that smart and I was very motivated for the test. On another level: I didn't answer some questions because I was afraid I'd be wrong. As a hypthetical example: 'How big is the moon?' I don't know that exactly, so I passed, but later learned that saying something as 'It has a diameter of a few thousands of kilometers' would've been right. And I'm also not a quick thinker, I need my time. But the psychologist that took my test was impressed how far I got on some questions. I feel that being slow has influenced my result. Also: there were a few questions that I believed to be difficult so I started thinking about it wrong and after sometime realised: 'Oh no, I'm totally misinterpeting this! I'ts simpler than what I'm doing!' But then the time was up. And these things frustrate me, honestly. 

Idk what to do or think right now anymore. These IQ results are now holding me back from believing I could be gifted, even though I recognize myself in it. I feel I could cry. I feel so lost ...   
Have others had this experience? Or are there others with some insights for me? Things I'm not seeing? Is taking a second IQ-test a good idea? Useless? Not 'fair' since I've done it before? 

I'm so sorry this post is so long, sorry for grammar mistakes (English isn't my first language), sorry if it's a bit incoherent ...",0
"Gifted child worrying too much about what friends think of her. How to encourage her to be confident? My second grader is lately obsessed about her friends, she joined gifted school this year and since being in this environment rather than leaning into the freedom to express herself in progressive-project-based learning school setting she has become less confident about herself. Teachers are sharing feedback around her always wanting to say or do what her two other friends want. To the extent she shuts down in group setting. She was a confident vocal (voice my opinion) type kid in old school. Now she is constantly worried about “how can I draw as good as this person?” “My thoughts/work are not as good as my friends work” “I will copy the work from my friends sheet as mine might not be perfect” she is losing sight of what is expected from her and thinks about what others think. She has even recently been involved in behaviors that is not “her” she knows it’s not right choice but would do it so her friend wont feel bad. 

I know gifted or not, child or as adults we struggle to find our voice in new settings. But how do I ensure my child doesn’t lose sight of how wonderful she is and be more confident in school? She is totally different person at home. We as parents use positive feedback more often and celebrate her personality at home all the time.",0
"Gifted child... how can I help him Hi all, I hate posting things like this because I feel 'show-offy' in any mother groups. 
But my beautiful 5 year old was just diagnosed with adhd by a behavioural paediatrician and giftedness (we are waiting to do the official diagnostic test until he is on appropriate medication for his adhd). 
I am not gifted, but my husband, his father was deemed gifted as a child (and also starting grief counselling seling due to the death of a sibling, and moving country - USA to NZ) 
I see so many posts about 'being the gifted kid and now an anxious adult' and we really want to nurture my son without putting that pressure on him. 
He is 5 and loves to read chapter books (james and the giant peach, Charlie and the chocolate factory, charlottes web... ) 
And knows his timestables up to 13x13. 
BUT while he excels in stem and reading, he also forgets to put his pants on sometimes - so you know, he's also a typical 5 year old!

I digress. 

How can I help him? What do you wish your parents did to help you? What should I NOT do? 

He's a sweet little boy with a wicked sense of humour. 

Also please be nice, I'm not trying to show off, nor do I think he is any more special than any other child. I'm just looking for guidance.",0
"Can experiencing nostalgia very intensely be a form of overexcitability? It's the one thing that I could never put my finger on. Other people don't seem to experience it and it's not part of any mental illness/disorder (I mean why would it be). I remember when I was little, probably around 10yo I was in bed thinking about the past and how I missed it and suddenly just started crying. I don't think I could describe it as nostalgia back then but that's what it was. So it's not anything new either. 

I do experience it just thinking about the past, usually when I'm in the right mood, like a melancholic one. But music is what really induces it. And more specifically, music I used to listen to a long time ago, typically the more time has past the stronger the nostalgia. I also save memories in music in a way. I know this isn't uncommon but to the degree I do it may well be. There are many many songs that take me back to a very specific moment in the past when I listened to the song. 
Along with what I can only describe as an overwhelming feeling of bitter-sweetness.

"Inching at a snail's pace I'm 23 years old, and I'm faced with some very tough decisions. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and I recently found out I was gifted. I've spent my adult life jumping from one fixation to another, going to school off and on, and fighting through seemingly one adverse experience to another. After surviving multiple years of domestic violence and getting clean from several substances, I spent 1.5 years recovering from prolonged trauma and I find myself at a fork in the road. There exists a multitude of paths, each with their own eventual splits. The possibilities are endless and it is daunting. The troube I'm experiencing is the fact that I'm no longer fresh out of high school and I've experienced first-hand what the world has to offer, and how merciless it can truly be, and I'm terrified. I'm no longer the naive 18 year old kid filled with excitement about the possibilities of life. 


I have posted in here before about my social alienation and come away with valuable insight, and I'm in a better place in that regard. I have a girlfriend who is similar to me in many ways and happens to be highly gifted, more so than me. We have interesting conversations, we exchange ideas, and best of all, we can coexist, with her working on tech-related projects and me studying languages, writing and doing other activities I enjoy. I'm slowly forming connections with others and it's both rewarding and enlightening. 


However, when it comes to choosing a path in college, I'm stuck. I have to consider to some degree what my financial situation will look like going down a particular path and most of my strengths aren't conducive to reaching the goal of financial security. I also need to take time into consideration. 


Where my strengths lie, I could very easily excel in something like history, linguistics, or a language in particular. I've grown quite accustomed to Slavic languages, which may be of some use somewhere. I've also always excelled in writing, whether it's fiction or merely the ability to express my thoughts and ideas clearly and in specific detail. However, I'm not certain what I can do with that if I expect to have any sense of financial security in the future. I also have a strong interest in psychology and I've considered going down that path, focusing specifically on working with underprivileged LGBTQ people. Perhaps I could work at an LGBT center. 


Being concerned with time, I've also considered starting a web development program at my local city college. I have absolutely no background in it, but you start with beginner level courses and the program is rather short and provides career counselling and assistance. 


There is so much I can do and I feel like I'm just hemorrhaging time I could be devoting towards a particular skill or vocation. I'm just stuck on what I should do. Has anyone else encountered this and pulled through? If so, how did you manage to do it?",0
"Does anyone else here only recognize their own giftedness in moments of alienation? I am a 58 y.o. female, retired academic. My husband is a not-yet retired academic and almost all of my friends have higher degrees and are bright and successful. After spending my 30s and 40s chasing career success, I belatedly realized that happiness is all about relationships. So I cherish my relationships. And I am generally happy where I am.   
I do not go around thinking I am gifted. In fact, I hardly ever think about it. I just try to live every day in the most fulfilling and helpful way possible. But every so often I walk face first into an invisible wall that seems to separate me from others, an invisible wall of something that I think is giftedness that makes me realize that I am really different than others, usually in a kind of depressing, lonely way. 

Fortunately, this doesn’t happen to me very often. Maybe those who are more gifted experience it more than I do. If so, I’m sorry. 

Example: About five years ago, I came down with the flu and was quite sick. High fever, chills, fatigue, weakness. All that. Basically stuck in bed all day. So, to entertain myself I spent hours learning Kanji characters (I didn’t decide just then to study Japanese. I had been teaching myself for a month or two (around a trip to Japan)). 

My husband, seeing me in bed with a fever and a bunch of Japanese-English language books and learning tools strewn about, said: “Why are you working so hard when you are sick!? Take it easy! You can just watch a movie or something.”   


But I explained to him that I  prefered working on my Japanese to watching a movie, however entertaining that movie might be. And he kept on with the “don’t be a workaholic, take it easy” thing. And I kept trying to explain: Of all the possible things that were in my power to do that day, learning Japanese was the most fun and the most relaxing thing I could think of. Way more fun and way more relaxing for me than watching some comedies on Netflix, for example.   


Anyway, I am not sure he ever completely understood. And this is my husband! Another academic!

"Jack of all trades, master of none I decided to write down all the past interests of mine that I could remember just to see if a pattern I noticed was true. And man not only was it true but I had no idea I've gone through so many different hobbies/phases. Dozens upon dozens of them. To call it a wide range of interests would be an understatement. 

I tend to get bored of things and move on really quickly and the pattern is that I lose interest in almost all of them due to some kind of an obstacle that prevents me from advancing or exploring the topic at a pace I would like to. That obstacle might be lack of necessary tools/materials, lack of challenge or unclear progression (last two usually go hand in hand).

This is probably in large part due to my ADHD (and possibly ASD, waiting for assessment), when something sparks my interest I usually delve into it very deeply and research it thoroughly. And because of this rapid progression I inevitably hit a wall at some point where I either lack material resources or insight as to what the next step in learning is (majority is the former though). This was either not the case or somehow counteracted in all my hobbies that lasted especially long. In the future I'll try to consciously plan out the progression to be more gradual & clear and make sure that I have all the resources I need beforehand. While likely pursuing more things simultaneously to make up for it.",0

I used this factor analysis of overexcitabilities to mark the items I relate to just so you know what I'm talking about.

I'm still waiting for my autism spectrum assessment (which is in a month) to know what is really going on here but I'm quite confident it's either one of these two or both, I mean it has to be. But of course I don't actually know yet whether gifted is the explanation. I've done a bunch of leaked professional and semi-professional tests and I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that I'm in the 130-140 range. It's not like I expected it either, I genuinely had never considered myself more than slightly above average and my academic performance mostly reflected that. 

The thing is, the term ""gifted"" already sounds bad enough in English but in my home country there isn't even such a concept nor is there awareness of it. The closest alternative is ""bright"" but that's just silly. I can't just suddenly go ""hey, btw I think I have a very high iq"", like come on...

"creating the first IEP - what normally goes into one? Our son has been identified as gifted after scoring very high on the CCAT7 and then WISC tests. He was offered a position at a gifted school because he meets the criteria, but every teacher, admin and counselor we spoke with said it isn't always necessary or worth ""uprooting"" a student who's in a good spot. He has lots of friends, supportive teachers and the only real negative we can see is that he's not challenged enough in class. Granted this is the 3rd grade.

So we've been told by everyone to make an IEP but I honestly have no idea what to put into one for a gifted but otherwise completely normal kid. I understand that some accommodation needs to be made for 2E kids. I also know that many IEPs are made for kids with other exceptionalities but none of that applies here.

To note, the school doesn't have a spec. Ed teacher who could pull gifted kids out of class for an afternoon per week. It sound like there are a few older gifted kids and they are in their regular classes.

"4year old bored at school Reposting this from parenting, 

How do I support my child when she complains about things being too easy at school? Initially I took it as kids just saying kids things but it gets to a point that she says it almost everyday. 

She is 4 years old, reading chapter books and doing maths more advanced than her age. She picks up reading when we read to her but we have no idea where she learns maths from. I have no plans to move her up a year but wondering what can I do so that she won't lose interest in learning. She is getting restless and shouts 'too easy' when teacher asks questions. She also goes around the class telling kids their work mistakes after she finishes hers. I would like her to stay humble, able to handle boredom and at the same time remain inquisive at school. 

How can I support her at home or is there anything the teachers at school can do? 

Also, we suspected she has adhd and plan to get her assessed when she is 5. She doesn't play with her classmates, couldn't relate to their super hero/princess obsession. Teachers at school said that she is very well behaved at school, when she is at home she couldn't sit still and she is always on the go.

"I'm progressively becoming dumber and dumber each and everyday. Help. So I was a very smart kid back then. I was a topnotcher since kinder and even graduated as valedictorian in elementary. And then high school came. I got into STEP  and still got good grades but I wasn't at the top anymore. At first, I was devastated. I was so used to being the best kid in school and it shattered my ego and everything. High school marked the start of my procrastination as well as my depression. But despite it all, I still could keep up with everyone in my class. Senior High, I got into STEM. I still got fairly good grades too, considering it was during the pandemic. But my mental health got worse quickly and I started to lose my motivation to study. But I still grafuated with honours, although I would prefer to have graduated with high honours, especially because almost all of my friends did. AND THEN COLLEGE FUCKING CAME. My mental health is the worst (so far...) and I even attempted to take my own life once or twice. College showed me how fucking stupid I really am. I really have no idea why I thought Civil Engineering would be the best course for me. Calculus kills me everytime I even think about it. I go to school everyday feeling ashamed of myself. It's finals season this week and all the tests I've taken so far have been less than satisfying. I've studied a lot and memorised way too many shit only to find out that 75% of what I studied weren't included in the tests. I AM SO FRUSTRATED I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I really miss the times when I could ace my tests without even trying. Nowadays, I could give my all and it would not pay off. I guess my procrastination, which is worse than ever, and the fact that I freeze everytime I face challenges didn't help one bit.

"Here is how i want to help gifted people and some of my story on OWNING and discovering my own giftedness  This is copied from my Gifted Adult Meetup Group: 

The purpose of this group is to fill a much need gap in society; to create a space where gifted adults of all genders, ages and sexualities can catch up and have meaningful conversations and experiences.

Being gifted can be an extremely isolating experience when no one understands what you are going through, how i is hard to fit into the work force and even find a partner or even relate to a psychologist.

You may not be able discuss your ideas about what you are working on with others or get tired of trying to explain why you do things differently - which is usually pretty much everything!

But take heart there IS a way to thrive and meet other like- minded people and this catch up is one of them.  
You don't need a diganosis, you can be self identified. And if you aren't sure, come along and if it feels like home, it is.

The events will be a combination of free chats maybe a small fee if we are booking a venue or getting a coffee/ meal and there will be some paid masterclasses where i will be covering different topics on giftedness. I will mix it up with in person and online events too.  
But, I am SOOOO open to suggestions about what you would like!! Whether it be a puzzle solving day or a group chat on a specific topic I'd love to know.

My Story

I never knew i was gifted as a child or adult until a few life events happened that made me wake up. As a child i was moved to a private school in year 5 as the work at the normal school was too easy. As a young adult I did a masters degree and became a psychologist. All good. Married a really smart guy. Then after a few years i just started becoming mind numbingly bored with everything. Why? i'd outgrown it and needed a new challenge. So, i wrote a book on perfectionism, people loved it. I went on TV in America. I created life coaching programs. Then my marriage ended. I started dating. I couldn't find any one i could relate to dating. No one. Couldn't find a job I liked. Got stuck. Everything i tried to do i felt trapped by the rules and constraints. Even in academia i felt like my art and creativity was being surpressed when i went back to do a design degree. I was depressed. I did a lot of therapy, and why was it my clients were getting better but i was still stuck, even though I'd healed a lot of my family of origin stuff. There was something else going on. Yes a mid life crisis true. Then one day i met some women on facebook that were gifted and i totally resonated, it opened up a whole never avenue of identity that I hadn't owned. It was still hard to own it because how dare i ever feel good about myself! i had so much shame around doing that. But i realised i would never be happy until i did. So, i had to say fuck what others think I'm brilliant. And I'm here to help humanity in a big way. Next hurdle overcoming the pressure of that sense of responsibility and stop sitting paralysed in my room for months on end. Just take one step at a time people, your dreams will materialize... My next idea is to do a documentary on giftedness....Can't wait. I made the below video a while ago. I dont know if i am autistic, I was assessed as not being. but I'm not sure it was accurate.",0
"Is What I am Experiencing Normal? Hi everyone. I've been having trouble trying to determine whether what I've been experiencing for the past few years is normal, and I thought I could post something on this subreddit looking for answers.

Just to preface, I am now in first year of University.

I was assessed and classified as gifted back in grade 3 and then ended up transferring to a gifted program at a different school in my city. I stayed there for 2 years, and I liked it, but I ended up having to switch back to a regular public school as my family moved. I've always struggled with my attention span (in the process of getting tested for adhd which I 100% think I have), but I've noticed that I don't think as differently/hard as I did when I was in the gifted program at school. I get good grades in comparison to others, but I miss having a challenge. 

I'm honestly just not sure if this is normal... Is it possible to lose your giftedness? Or am I just not getting the proper content that pushed me as hard as I was pushed in the gifted program?

Is there anyway I can get my old self back? I used to be so strong in writing and now I feel like my work isn't half as good as the work I did back in grade 4 and 5.

"Can you guys explain to me how/why giftedness is a neurodivergence? Edit to clear up some confusion, so it turns out I had just misread/misinterpreted the rule, it doesn't say that giftedness isn't neurodivergent. Just wanted to clear that up

Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit, though I'm not new to neurodivergent communities. I was tested gifted (iq 134 I think) at age 5 so yeah, hello

So anyway I was reading the rules and a few of the faqs and have determined that giftedness is considered a neurodivergence in these parts. The thing is, on a different subreddit (not naming it to get around rule 7 just in case), the rules state specifically that giftedness is not a neurodivergence. I would ask over there why it's not, how they arrived at that conclusion, but I'm not sure if mentioning iq is allowed over there. 

Btw I'm not trying to imply giftedness isn't a type of neurodivergence, I'm just saying I've seen 2 directly contradictory sources of information and wanted to ask because I genuinely don't know. Most of what i see on the internet implies that it is but I want to know what makes that the case y'know?

Anyway that's all I have to say for now, thanks!",0
"Building a Gifted Program @ K-12 School I posted this on a different subreddit but got no responses so I'm hoping that this one will be more appropriate and will get some responses and ideas. 

tl;dr: We're planning on starting functional gifted services at the K-12 school I work at in Florida. How do we do it?

I work at a K-12 charter school in Florida. We have a couple of dozen gifted students but currently do not provide gifted services. The plan is to change this for next school year so we need to create (or purchase) a gifted program so we can start servicing the students.

I am currently working under the impression that I'll be a department of one and if it's not full-time, I have enough certifications that they will find other things for me to do that will make it a full-time position.

What do I need to know about doing this? How are programs typically set up when you have to meet with such a wide range of ages and abilities and interests? What services are typically provided? How long and how often would I be meeting with the students? This will likely be a pull-out program rather than a push-in program, but nothing is set in stone so if you can provide arguments in favor of one over the other, I am all ears!

Please also answer the questions that I should be asking but aren't. I'm not even entirely sure what questions I should be asking.

"Great with difficult tasks, can't do ""easy"" tasks I'm a freelance writer with a wide variety of work. Some projects are stupidly ""easy"" while others require a lot of thought.

I'm currently in school for herbalism so I'll only have to freelance for a few more years in theory.

(Side note- all I can think about is herbalism when I'm bored while writing. I just want to be studying and making new teas and infusions. I don't want to be writing stupid articles just to rank.)

I'm sick of crying and losing money over these simple articles. I've worked seemingly ""boring"" and ""easy"" jobs in the past but I was always outside and able to listen to podcasts so I had a great time.

I put ""easy"" in quotes because it's all subjective and I don't want to talk down on assignments that pay my bills and allow me to provide for my family, or on a client who has treated me very well. Some of his assignments are right up my alley, but recently I got a HUGE order that makes me want to bang my head against the wall.

Any advice?

Edit- sitting outside helps a lot and I need to do it more often. Of course the obvious like exercising also helps me focus. It's just a matter of actually doing it. I'm thinking of making a strict schedule for myself.

Edit 2- unfortunately my fellow ADHD'ers have reminded me that the disorder does in fact suck

"Gifted Meetup and Masterclasses Hi all i have been working with a coach for the last year on how to live joyously and well as a gifted person..

"Thoughts about physical exercise and possible ADHD? Hi all, 

I am a 28yo(F) and I am encountering some problems in which I am not entirely sure what is the cause or the sollution.

So, for about two years now I believe I am gifted: I show almost every sign from a very young age (ranging from extreme eagerness to learn, boredom in school to intense emotions, large vocabulary etc). It is just quite expensive to let me be tested and I am also a bit nervous to do so. However, I still plan to get officially tested within 2 years, because I think it will help me with accepting the way things are in my life.

This is where I would like to hear your thoughts on:
My brother has been tested at a young age and was diagnosed with PDD-NOS(autism) and ADHD. He had done everything in his power to make my life miserable, causing severe childhood trauma, from which I am still recovering (luckily I am quite far in the process). Due to his problems, i was preventively sent for autism/ADHD tests as well. These tests came back negative and I was not tested for giftedness. My school also did not want to check for it when I was about 7 or 8, since my readings skills were behind (that turned out a medical issue, nothing to due with my intelligence).

My mother has always been very dismissive in a really toxic way about exercise and I was extemely tense since my brother was harassing me all day. I became quiet and I never really dared to express myself physically (singing, running, existing). On top of that, my medical issue (not having the right kind of glasses) caused extreme headaches while doing exercise and everyone laughed at me because I was a sports disaster due to being unable to estimate angles where things like a football were coming from. Now with the right glasses, I still can't get myself to the physical exercise, even though my head is racing all day and I feel like I have far, FAR to much energy.

Sometimes I am wondering if I might struggle with ADHD as well, but that would contradict my earlier diagnosis and it seems not really fitting since I had no learning problems with school: I have been in an almost constant hyperfixation-mode until the end of high school. Then I collapsed from the abuse and everything became too much.

So, i spent the years working on becoming a more healthy person, but I still feel haunted still in terms of doing exercise like biking, going to the gym, etc.  I really want to learn how to channel my energy, without feeling extremely miserable. 

So my questions are:
1) Side question: Are there more people with giftedness and ADHD experiencing this (read: would it be interesting to find out whether I could have ADHD or not?)
2) Main question: What are your thoughts about doing exercises and what helps you to make that work for you?",0
"Any one else feel this way? When I am very interested in something, every other subject loses its gravity. No matter how bored I am, I can always pull out a book or go to a website and read about physiology. I can study other things, but they often feel like side quests. I want to have knowledge in several areas. However, it’s such an effort not to think about physiology when reading about other subjects.
Like in math, I will get bored and start thinking about what is going on in my mind, like what brain circuits I am using while being bored and what neurochemicals are active at that moment. Then the questions spiral out of control until I follow up on one that I attempted to satisfy. The craving for knowledge on this subject is almost addictive. I am ADHD and medicated, just so you know. Feel free to give any tips or advice.",0
"Advice for Younger Gifted People and Education This is advice that would have made my life easier a few months ago. I was the kid in high school that rarely (if ever) studied, and I finished in the top ten of my class. I never learned techniques to study, and that ended up hurting me after graduation.   


My freshman year of college was pretty easy for me academically. Then, bam! The first semester of my sophomore year rolled around, and it hit me like a truck. I had a 1.8 GPA the first marking period! I buckled down, and I realized that I needed to change my habits. What helped me was putting a larger emphasis on my homework; I didn't even know there was a different way of doing it. Instead of doing the homework to get it done, I did it to learn the material. If something in class wasn't super clear, I read a book about the theories on my own time. If I wasn't getting it, I also reached out to professors and friends for help. I finished out the semester with a 2.4 GPA, and I increased all of my grades except for one. It was my hardest semester, but it was also the most rewarding. What I recommend doing is teaching yourself how to learn before you are forced to do so by the difficulty of your courses.   


Let me know if any of y'all have any other questions! I'm happy to help when and where I can.

"Any entrepreneurs here? Tired of dealing with a business world that doesn’t get it Basically what the title says. Thankfully I work on my own, but the amount of shit I have to deal with is incredible. 

In the past, I have seen very superficial colleagues (and sometimes idiots, I am sorry but that’s what it is) being chosen over me for management positions. Guess who they relied on after being promoted? That’s right, yours truly.

So I thought “fuck it” and went freelance. I have been working on my own for nearly a decade now. The exact same thing continues to happen, I am just getting handsomely paid for the annoyance.

But I struggle to find new clients, because I am expensive, and that’s because I offer quality. It’s difficult to make people understand that, and I often don’t have visibility as a contractor or I am asked to sign an NDA.

I am considering setting up a company and hiring others to do my job, and I have spoken with business consultants who said “are you sure that is a good choice” and “why don’t you just charge differently and continue working on your own”.

I live in a HCOL area and I don’t have the luxury of hesitating any longer. I’d rather not go into details on what I do.

"Re daughter My daughter is 9 and was assessed as 'gifted' last year. We don't really talk about her as being special or anything but encourage her to work hard, and enjoy learning (as we do with our son, 7). I hear the stories here and don't connect them with her as she is otherwise a very regular kid, with friends, hobbies and so on. 

One thing I notice is that she has this energy for everything and really crams everything into a day - piano, reading, playing, sewing, writing in the morning and then after school activities - basketball, drama, singing, swimming, tennis and wants to do scounts, rock climbing, painting and so on... I want to say yes to everything but also work 4 days and run the house and so she thrives while I'm running her around and I feel she is never really satisfied and could always do more. Whatever we are doing she is up for it and more. I love this but it's really full on as well. I don't know if this is related to her IQ, and if so, and advice, or if it's just part of her? I'm sure it's not behaviour exclusive to high IQ.

"dyscalculia I've been treated like I'm dumb my entire life so I started to believe I'm dumb and not able to understand math due to having dyscalculia has helped contribute to this thought pattern. 

They've tried for a long time to calculate my IQ and it has always changed. They finally wrote down that they cannot accurately determine my IQ due to multiple disabilities especially cause dyscalculia and a processing disorder.

 I have gifted friends who have explained to me that I'm not stupid and I seem to understand some complicated stuff that the average person doesn't but they can't seem to convince me and I always feel like there just trying to make me feel better although that isn't the case. 

I see a common idea is that gifted or [higher than average inteligence but not gifted] means high IQ or great ability in mathematics. So I have to ask do people like me exist and can this be true that I could be smarter than average even with that disability? 

I hear twice exceptional exists but I never hear about dyscalculia and gifted people or above average inteligence. I've always felt lonely and I've been prone to talking over people's heads or getting disregarded in therapy due to appearing smarter than I am.

"Am I silly for wanting ACT accommodations? I have diagnosed ADHD, which my giftedness has overshadowed for most of my life. I did wonderful in school up until 9th grade where the overwhelming emotions of being a teenager, experiencing imposter syndrome, and my horrible ability to detach myself from reality anytime something slightly overwhelmed me caused me to down spiral. I found refuge in online school until that became too much and I was (and still kind of am) months behind in school. Eventually, my brilliant mother pieced together that I had ADHD. Now that you have my life story I'll get to what this is all about. I know I could take the ACT and get a fine score. I took it once in 7th grade for some program and got an 18 (a score that I was frustrated with as I knew I could get higher.) And again in 9th grade and got a 24. I know that I could take it and get a score that a lot of people would accept as good and move on. But aren't I still being held back from my true potential by a learning ""disability"" (quotes because I don't know if that's the correct term to use?) I'm having trouble figuring out if it would be silly to ask about this. I know that I'm ""smart"" enough to level the playing field, but that doesn't change the fact that I have a very hard time maintaining internal focus. I am constantly thinking about a **multitude** of random things, this can come from a thought that just pops into my head or a specific word that jumpstarts a memory/previous thought that I had been dwelling on. I find myself reading sentences 8 or 9 times, before realizing I'm not even reading them at all, just going through the motion of ""reading"" whilst thinking about something, and not even *realizing* it. Someone, please give me an outside perspective on this because I'm too uncertain.

&#x200B;

Now that I'm re-reading this I didn't mention that I am medicated, but medication only goes so far, and I really only feel it helps with giving me satisfaction after completing a task (cleaning my room, doing the dishes ETC.) It does not, however, calm that neverending need for any sort of stimulation (internal or external) I can find.",0

"Is not the liberation of our gifted soul the answer to many of our world's problem? Let's face it - 

  
We are witches. We understand slightly more - thus, see through contradiction and break through molds. We are what helps us (humanity) go forward.

"Do you think this is appropriate on a cover letter? Hello, I am gifted and see myself as the rose with 1000 thorns. I am tired of each trying to pick me up, only to throw me and step on me each time a thorn appears. There is a delicate approach in understanding ourselves  - yet, I have grown tired of hiding myself - so fearful that if I show true self, someone will touch and get hurt by my thorns.   


Especially since it has led me to be burnt out, and miserable - trying to protect others, while those who claim to care for me and protect me are the very people who do not see me.  Everyone thinks they know me - everybody is certain that if they were me, they would do so much more - yet they do not understand the complexity, and pain of being gifted.   


I understsand - the idea of of masking/unmasking ourselves is quite controvertial with this subreddit - but, i hope for those who feel my desire to expose myself would invite further alienation would respect that I cannot see how much further I am going to get alienated given that I have lost so much trying to mask myself. In that regards, to those who feel me -   


I am wondering if you feel this is an appropriate way to add to a cover letter.

"My four year old got his first A+. I have mixed feelings. As a child, I was years ahead of my classmates in math.

I was taught that getting high marks was very important and I was rewarded for them. I remember being devastated when I didn’t get a high mark on a homework assignment.

My four year old son is also years ahead of his peers in math.

He attends a play based junior kindergarten and he has never been graded for anything.

He also attends the Russian School of Math two grade levels above his age (but that might change). 

We enrolled him because we want to encourage his talent and recognize that he might find school boring. His classmates at school are learning to recognize numbers and he’s playing with the Collatz conjecture (seriously).

Usually, RSM gives stickers when the kids do their lesson work.

This time, there was a large red A+ written across his lesson because he did the entire thing independently (he did it in less than 15 minutes and spent the rest of the time drawing constellations and silly faces)

My son didn’t know what it meant. He wrote A minus next to it because “minus is the opposite of plus”

I know on the surface this sounds ridiculous but should I ask them to give stickers because he’s too young to be chasing the A+. He’s so much younger than the other kids in his class.

So what do you all think? 

Bonus: if your kid attends or if you attended RSM, I’d love to hear your experience.",0
"Am I narcissistic? I am currently a junior in high school and when talking to my peers I usually have two thoughts. “Wow this person is dumb” and right after, “why would you even think that?? You can always learn something from somebody.” I try to live by that motto every day, but sometimes I try to talk to people my age, or even my elders, and I always get bored or irritated because they don’t understand concepts or they are so confident while saying something so wrong. Then, when I try to correct them, they get mad/defensive. I have heard countless times from many different age groups that “Oh my god you make me feel so stupid” but that really isn’t my intention. I just want people to be educated when they talk on certain subjects. It has now evolved into some of my friends saying they know a certain subject we are discussing and then I ask them about it and they admit that they really do not know. The reasoning that they give me is “well I feel dumb when I talk to you and I don’t know what you’re talking about”. But if they don’t know something I would rather they admit it and I give them a better/more in-depth explanation then act like they do know. Typically I get agitated when I find out they lied and not when they need a better explanation.


Edit: Ok I see a lot of “well people are allowed to be wrong” in the comments. So should we just stop fact checking people then?? It’s not the fact that people are wrong, it’s the unwillingness to be wrong when someone tells them they are

Also, i think some of you missed the part where I said corrections and not advice. I am not going around telling people that their morals are wrong or that god isn’t real. And I’m also not telling people what to do in a situation or invalidating their feelings. What I said I was doing is giving people the correct information when they are wrong about something that CAN BE PROVEN.

Edit #2: if all that you’re going to comment is that I’m a know it all and that I want to look smarter/argue with others, please don’t comment. I’m looking for actual advice so if you’re just here to tell me what I am then don’t comment. I know

Also, when correcting people, I am not turning it into a lecture. Its just them being wrong about something, me telling them what they were wrong about, and moving along in the conversation. Unless they ask me the reason, I usually don’t go off on a tangent about why.",0
"Self confidence How many of you are healthily self confident, or like me ,brief periods of false bravado aside, anything but self confident about your intelligence? I expect to be exposed as a charlatan,fake, fraud sooner rather than later. That's not because anyone has said I am. Indeed the high IQ community has been more positive about my cognitive ability than I am about myself .  I have immense self doubt, despite doing fine on psychometrician created and/or normed tests. Much of it stems from 'bullying related trauma' and not having a degree. I've been very phobic about pursuing further education because of the trauma.",0
"I seem to have a distaste for sympathy? From my understanding, I'm not gifted im just an idiot. Plus I got ASD and ADHD.  But I can't find anywhere else that I can post this that relates. I hate how when sharing information about my situation people only sympathize and offer hugs. It makes me incredibly annoyed. Cause I'm looking for solutions and I'm constantly wanting to analyze the world around me and I want them to toss ideas and concepts back even if they're wrong or right so I can go over options and dissect the information. Don't get me wrong I'm glad people care and want to help me feel better. But their attempts don't help. Sometimes it feels like the only thing I care about in the world is the information and nobody can follow along I get outcasted and they go into default mode not knowing what to say.",0
"Some ramblings about my condition as ""F1shfuck3r2003"" Honestly Just a stream of thoughts to try and justify my condition. I am a Young Guy 19 years old, all my life i felt like there is a disconection between the me i experience and the one i show, a mask If you Will, i don't know for certain How that mask portrays It self in function not only for what i can shape of It, but Also the limitations of my thoughts in defining How i seem to the outside world. And If i were to continue this i think i should stabilish what i think of myself and what i objectively am. In what i believe is and ""dunning krugernization"" of the big give personality traits.

I am highly introverted( or lowly extroverted whatever fits your hat),being so i despise being the center of attention and mostly wish to talk only at one person (that fits a criterea) or a group of like minded people.

My neuroticism and overall emotional stability seem to little bit lower then average but often i see me in those profoundly non-social stressfull envioroments and in them my self steem persists as a burning rage of hate against existence itself , i simply am able to completly cope with any form that i know of existencial depression or overall existencial dread while being aware of It most of the time.

I am highly open to ideas and criticissm as well Very creative in my Fields of interest, that would pretty much even at a general level ALL of the sciences as well abstract and philosphical Fields, and expend the majority of my time aware of what i need to reflect or Just reflection and introspectivo almost every Second of each day. even tho the epistemology used to gather and hypothesise over the data might be questionable.

I believe i am selective when It comes to agreeableness as i feel pretty much nothing towards most people misery and often think of them as well as my self as functions in a system that can be reduced to It's most fundamental values and treated as nothing more, and yes i see the issues with that line of thought, and i do scold myself a Lot over what i think and what i should think of the people that surround me in a form of internal debate that resembles the atriction between what to Desire and what to restraint, that of wich some would call ""a moral conscience"".

And for last we have conscientiousness.
I am not Very conscientious but that would be more for lack of necessity than otherwise, with what others would be worried about like debt or overall living expenses, i am okay (for my life i have been a Very privileged but Still quite contempt and never very greedy about what i wish to be gifted more then what the social contracts require) and instead worry about things that aren't urgent, like what Will be the consequences of genetic engeneering If It is released an upgraded form of gene therapy on the Market or If there is a way to unify the universe into a being whose concsciousness would be able to subvert the Nature of what It is made of, and then what would be the results of the change of Power between the made and the material It limits It's expression. I got Carried out, Sorry.

But i Still would like to have a deeper understanding of myself as well How i am My greatest enemy and what to be cautios of when REMINDED i am an imperfect human being.
As well the roots of what i think could develop in some form of mysogyny and i fear that.
But being more clear, i suspect that my misantropy, wich It's bases is Very questionable and i could to some degree be considered a racist, even tho ALL of those are given rise to lack of experience and overall social anxiety. But as saying, i think my misantropy is not equal across the sexes, i think i fear both women and Men, but mostly because i expect the worse in them, or expect almost no concsciousness or self-critical thinking, aligned with their fact i need and Desire some degree of bonding and ""to be accepted"" as well seem most of those Men who seem uneducated and are from minorities,. Be It Black or latino. Or in the case of women a necessity for aproval for those i see as authorities. I don't know the exact reason why these fears, although i have some ideas, the fear of them is real and i am not proud of It.

Well If by now you Still don't think i am an asshole i would probably greatly hate you or be weirdly empathethic depending on the reason of such ""aproval"" and If you do think i am an asshole, i say to you that i would like to know why and How i could be an overall more agreeable person as well being more able to see the ""Gold from the mud"", to be more respectful and less entitled due to My ignorance and my hubris.

"What is the best type of therapy/psychological help for late discovered giftedness. Lately discovered via psychologist and IQ test that i’m gifted she could recommend only one psychologist specialised in giftedness but the location is to far away. also the psychologist was not familiar enough with the subject. I experienced in many psychological help in the past that it was not beneficial, only thing that had semi effect was cognitive behaviour therapy, although the psychologist recommended to search for more specific treatments that are specialised for gifted people but couldn’t really explain what it is.

So what’s my problem: overstimulation and imbalances in energy levels due to thinking, adapted behaviour, under stimulation, extremely driven, restlessness, depression and isolation, overthinking in social environments and hawks eye/loop perspective, burnout/bore out multiple times, inability to create, procrastination, loneliness, being misunderstood, can’t find like minded friends even if i am an extraverted person and have friends. next to that i am the school dropout/challenger type of gifted. 

And yes these symptoms are related due to giftedness in development. 

Are there any other people who experienced something similar or can give advice?

"Does anyone feel like people are narcissistic, tribalistic, or nitpicky these days? I remember this conversation where I was trying to explain my experiences and thoughts but this NPC thought it was a direct attack on his soul. I think people look down on me based on looks and status. They also don't understand that statements can be true in some context and not in other contexts (black and white thinking). I also experienced distrust based on nothing but looks and other superficial differences.

Has anyone here faced similar experiences? How are you doing and what do you think we as a society can do to fix this? Many people are already talking about this narcissism/tribalism/lower iq trend but their words are largely flushed into the toilet.

"6.5 year old, I'd love some opinions. Hello all,

My 6.5 year old son has always been an advanced reader, and loves doing math problems in his head. After some interesting conversations with his teacher it was clear that the teacher wasn't going to allow him to read more challenging books than the class, or provide any extra math problems to keep my son interested.

We decided to go out of pocket to have him assessed, as the school board won't be assessing him until he is around 10 years old.

The psychologist reported back a fsiq in the 92nd percentile, a GAI in the 98th percentile. Of note was her verbal comprehension where he was in the 99th percentile. They are recommending an IEP for giftedness.

We don't want him moved from his class, we mostly just want something we can point to while we say, ""No, he won't be reading the picture books at home.""

Are there any downsides to getting the IEP in place? I guess I'm looking for the perspective of anyone who had an IEP like this.",0
"Hypothesis on Lifetime Success - Lifetime Success is Largely Determined by the Ability to Overcome Deeply Ingrained Cognitive Biases in Behavior. I have spent a disproportionate amount of time in my life thinking about why people are the way they are, the problems they have, and the root causes of those problems. I suspect that the issue is the brain's natural approach to life includes a series of cognitive biases that helped evolutionarily but no longer do. They seem to stem from the brain's desire to conform information it's ""seeing"" to its already existing model.

One prominent example is the tendency for group conformity demonstrated in Asch's conformity experiments. While many of us may be in the 25% of people who always chose the correct line, I don't believe we're perfectly non-conforming in more socially important situations, but I believe the ability to be non-conforming in certain situations is what sets people apart in major ways.",0
"Disclaimer - I am not gifted, have any of you experienced bullying from gifted kids? I got mocked through out Middle school/Music school, changing schools 5 times - staying 5th at time when lockdown started Sorry if I cause you pain by reading my comment,I am not aware of my english mistakes - Grammar, spelling, punctuation. I've been bullied all my life , never had friends when I was little due to lower IQ, lower inteligence, I was treated the same way as Charly Gordon by bakers from ""flower for algernon"" I couldnt understand why people laughed at me, stole my personal items, made me do foolish things in public to make me a mockery, I was their jester and their taste of humor involved me being picked on. There were few gifted student, gifted girls who often got seperated from regular classes attending gifted program or more accelerated program - this is due to being forced getting tested early age 8 Woodcock Johnsons IQ test - or atleast evaluated further suspecting giftedness. At 1-4th grade I was pushed away from groups/my class, I didnt talk alot, I had nothing to say particularly, I dont remember my childhood that much - just the abandonment and teachers calling me stupid dull acting surprised if I could perform atleast average or if I can recall anything from previous classes. Teachers were open to speak infront of all class if student wasnt performing good - if they made a mistake/couldnt understand material, so I was a mockery to teacher probbly that nfluenced students to bully me and see me as a low mediocre pathetic human, I remember being called cringe when I rarerly spoke, I could hear those girls they whispered to one another idk how they thought I couldnt hear or if anyone couldnt hear - it wasnt in my native language they did say (cringe) in english might have thought I'm incapable of learning another language which took me more than 5 years. I was ostracized alot because of them, + when I asked my teacher not to get bullied by my classmates, teacher decided it's best to talk with all of the clas instead of (who, i mentioned) make my every day shittier than it allready was cuz now they started calling me many different words relating to (Me asking teacher for help) making a mockery of that action I took. I moved out from that school I got into 10th grade, 3 months into new school I moved cuz I tried to kil myslef I was hospitalized. 3rd school they sorted children by difficulty level, I got sent to highest difficulty for english classes despite as I appear very poor beginner level of english, I got selected cuz my grade was 8/10,I got bullied by teacher, she asked(Why are you here instead of lower difficulty) - I'm guessing she has never felt insecure cuz the whole class was involved hearing her words directing towords me + my social anxiety made it worse so I was sent to lower class difficulty instead middle cuz my teacher never heard me speak english.

"Threatened by other people's intelligence. I'm sure I'm not the only one dealing with this kind of thing. I'm 22, was categorized as gifted as a kid, and generally for most of my life I was considered by most people to be smart. Very smart even. While I don't feel very smart myself, that perception that people have of me has solidified as a key to my self esteem. In a sense, I'm only good insofar as I am polite and smart.

Now, intellectually I understand that this is silly. Your worth isn't determined by how smart you are, and the fact that someone is smarter than you (whatever that even means) doesn't make your own intelligence meaningless. My friends will not suddenly stop valuing me because someone smarter happens to exists nearby.

And yet I can't help but feel like the mere presence of other highly intelligent people is a threat. That I should always do my best to prove myself superior. I don't want to make a fool of myself and miss out on friendships because of my own insecurities.

How do I stop feeling like that?",0
"How common is it for you guys to feel like therapy isn't going anywhere?

Perhaps they were just incompetent and improvised instead of giving professional advice, who knows.

I sometimes think (and this probably sounds hella narcissistic but it's not meant to) that I need someone much smarter and wiser than myself for therapy to work. I need something novel in terms of solutions and I need help with things that are outside of my control (such as executive dysfunction from ADHD but that's a whole 'nother story).

"How to be content? 26 (M). 
I have been certified gifted from a young age, iq 135 at 9 years old but never told, then 145 at 26.

Growing up I had always been puzzled by how silly, illogical, and dumb my peers were. They didn't understand the long teem effects of decisions, they didn't digest information as quickly, and thier social dynamics were easy to predict and influence. Additionally, my overbearing parents didn't allow me to socialise much outside of school, which made me feel more isolated and lonely. I had a few good friends but the only commonalities we shared were memes and video games. They didn't share my fascination with the world, my physical activity level, and most of all mu understanding of society. I was seen ad smart, wise, and confident, with many kids coming to me for help ans support. But there was no one I could turn to. My parents were cold and distant. And with that I decided to do my best and that when I've grown up my freedom as an adult will help me bulid my prefect world. 

I moved abroad for uni, started businesses, made friends from all over the planet, but never felt fulfilled. All the people I meet are predictable, too emotionally influenced, and almost none understood my fascination with everything. This led me to years of depression, feeling deeply isolated and sad. No one noticed ofc nor did i want them to. I thought that maybe I should try dating, something I was putting off until I had at least found my tribe, but since that failed why not I thought. As a tall man with many desirable qualities, I had no issues meeting interested women, but the criteria for a romantic interest turned out to be much higher and harder to meet than that of a friend. 

I went to psychologist to talk about my loneliness with. He noticed that I might be gifted, had me tested, and voila a 145. After i asked my parents if they knew, my mum told me about the other test and that they didn't  think much of it. I was confirmed to be different. An Alien. Something I always knew but never wanted to admit. He said that I am unique and deep relationships will always be hard to create for me. I lowered  my expectations of others to help close the gap but it's hard.

My food tastes more bland with every passing month, hobbies keep getting dull, people are books following a cliche storyline. Why do I stay? Why do I continue to exist? I've travelled extensively, I tried so much but felt so little. Why can't I be dumb and happy? Why can't i be reckless? Why can't I make mistakes and be OK with it? Even if I force myself, it'll all be fake. I don't have the pleasure of naivety. I try to find pleasure in the little things but I need more. How can I be content? 

Ps: I treat myself well, excercise, cook/eat good food, try new activities constantly and try and meet interesting people. But I'm getting sick of it all. I wish to be erased from existence so that I can finally feel at peace. No suicidal thoughts, just hopping thanos snaps me away aka natural causes.",0

"Anyone else feels higher levels of giftedness is seen as insanity? See, I experienced war trauma as a child. And thus, I was orphaned by the world at a young age. Parents absent, communities that did not know how to love. Teachers a bit overwhelmed. 

To cope with a world that never understood me - i simply disassociated and built an inner world. I had no cable growing up, so i read books to run away from it all. I found solace in Matilda - i was certain I too had a gift. Because why else would life to be so unfair. 

Since then, I simply showed people what i thought was the ideal of being a human. Someone kind, someone who believed in the ideals and values of not just my parents culture, or my new nation but that of the world. I learned from Disney and I tried to be a prince in the best way I could. This is how the mind of a gifted child with no home, in constant trauma found hope - that one day, it will get better. 

So, as I grew older, everyone saw me through their lived experience and the little i showed to them. Even with my closest friends - they failed to see me.

I did not know i was gifted - because my schools identified me as a slow learner. Yet, i did end up in University, which was a break thru for my family. The first - and I did enter the work force and i excelled - i was a rising star but i still thought me a bit insane simply because they did not understand my inner world and complexities.

Like I had people who came from wealthy families who accused me of having a wealthy father and connection. Others saw me defending the poor as a facade and brand. Its almost like they all saw me as a sociopath.

"There isn't a way out, is there? Today I went to the psychotherapist to tackle various problems.  But somehow I had the feeling that I couldn't be helped and that this will never change.  I have the feeling that there is no way out of this ""madness"".  I have the feeling that therapists somehow don't understand me with all these dubious connections that my brain forms.  All these possibilities that are there. 3000 thoughts at the same time that I can't sort.  The knowledge that everything is possible leads to this insanity, in which I am no longer able to do anything.  I had my therapist appointment at 11am today and I didn't even know how to address the fact that 11am is the middle of the night for me because I have a completely opposite sleep schedule.  Sometimes I feel like pure madness.

I mean that I often do things ""on the side"" that other people would never think of.  I'm often said to have a ""different"" way of thinking, people think I'm crazy.  And if that's what I'm told, then sometimes I wonder what ""madness"" I'm actually living in.  For example, some time ago I wrote and illustrated and published a book.  And that's not a huge achievement in principle, but I do something like that on the side.  I sometimes have the feeling that my whole life is so ""on the side"".  On the side, bachelor thesis, writing books on the side, on the side madness.  

I do things on the side that other people work towards their entire lives.  And right after that comes ""What's next?""  Somehow there is no rest, no break.  And there's no way to escape from that, is there?  I might be able to do something like that, but normal everyday things.. THEY are highly complex for me.  Showering, personal hygiene, as you can see, sleeping.  supermarket purchases.  In those situations I act like the biggest idiot.",0
"Verbal high IQ My 7 year old just went through evals (to look into an ADHD diagnosis). He has always been pretty curious and verbal. He tested 99 percentile in verbal skills (WISC-V) and listening comprehension (WIAT-4). The reason we took him in is because he has sort of low frustration tolerance and tends to get in trouble for chatting at school. His other scores were more average (80-90%). 

The psych emailed his teacher and said his chatting was boredom, and he needed increased challenge. I can promise you that his teacher rolled his eyes all the way into the back of her head.

I guess I just don’t know what to do with the information? If anything. He has an impossible bar for himself in everything he does. What if his teacher doesn’t agree that he needs more challenge? What does it mean if a kid tests “gifted” in a couple areas but within normal ranges in all others? Does it matter?",0
"Heya! Hi!

I was in the gifted program in school. I just don't know where else to put this.

I'm not the smartest person. Most of the time, I'm the stupidest in the room, but I'm very good at intellectualizing and putting my feelings into words that resonate with people when I really try.

I used to be really proud of this, but I'm realizing that perhaps I intellectualize too much. Like, I put my descriptions of my feelings on my sleeve, but I never hand people \_me\_. When stressful events happen, I logically handle it and logically 'experience' it before I actually let my brain process the emotion, if that makes sense? I'm learning to sit with uncomfortable emotions, let people in my heart rather than my head, and how to remember that my mother loves me when I'm sad.

I just wanted to see if anybody was willing to try with me. I'm looking for friends that I 'click' with, and it's really hard. A lot of my friends think with their heart before their head, so I feel like I hurt them a lot with how emotionally unavailable I am, and I don't want to subject them to that. I also don't want them to know just how much I actually mask around them, because they might see that I'm an entirely different person when I'm alone and realize that we don't actually click.

I want a friend who's down to be told 'this conversation is boring to me' and 'I don't like this particular thing about you but I like you just enough still'. I want a friend who's kind of a jerk, I guess. Are you a jerk? Maybe we'll get along.

Give it a shot :) Be mean to me!",0
"I can make friends. I can’t keep friends. I (20f) have no problem making friends. I pride myself on being friendly, compassionate, easy to talk to, and reliable. But, through all my teen years and now into my 20s, I cannot hold on to a friendship. No one is outright unkind, but they just kinda stop talking to me over time. I’ve attributed this to many things over the years - my depression, the fact that I was homeschooled for a while, my social anxiety, my odd interests. But those have all come and gone, and, no matter the variables, I cannot hold on to friends. I think it’s also worth mentioning that I actually have quite a few good friends who live across the country or whatever. I’ve maintained those friendships for years, but I can’t just call them up to hang out. It’s also easier for me to hang out with guys, and people significantly older than me, but I think they are a lot less likely to ask me to hang out.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.",0
"struggling with master thesis Hello, I am glad I found this community.
Tbh, I am not sure if I am gifted (no diagnosis and I just recently started researching this topic more), but I do think I have similar problems.
- perfectionism
- overthinking and thinking too complex
- I also get carried away fast with side topics that come up during research but are not that important for my thesis
- paradox: only got A's in my master courses, but taking super long time to finish thesis / not good with deadlines

My problem is, that I am wanting to finish my thesis but I am also very slow! I got all the information in my head, I know everything that I need to write but it is hard for me to write it down in the complex way in which it exists in my head. And if I write ""mediocre"" sentences I feel like I am writing nonsense/sth. that does not do justice to the topic. At the same time I just want to finish and probably never write an academic thesis again. Which also feels weird, because I do cognitively understand the research, but I am so bad in writing my thoughts down. When I get in a flow though, I write very good stuff.
If this makes sense to anyone, I would be so happy to hear your advice/experience.",0
"Question for autistic members of this sub I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was 12 but I don't use the ""Asperger's"" label. I also found out I was highly gifted recently. There has also been a disconnect between my presentation and clinical expectations, which is fairly common, but also a disconnect between my experiences and that of other autistic people. 

I want to address the disconnect with clinical expectations, because after my diagnosis, these expectations played a role in the way I was treated by people in my life. Basically, it was assumed that I was incompetent in areas where I had always shown competence before. There's also a disconnect between much of the information I've read about autistic interests in some research materials and what I experience. For example, I've read that it's fairly common for autistic people to gather information and facts about particular subjects of interest, often without fully understanding what these facts mean. I have found that these descriptions tend to take on a tone of pathologization, implying disorder and disfunction. All my interests since I was a child, no matter how small, has been described as a special interest when my interest in that subject may either be passing or merely one of my multiple interests I like to pursue. I have no interest in learning about something without understanding and applying it to some sort of personal or creative endeavor, either. 

&#x200B;

Other traits that are associated with autism that present atypically for me include language, communication, repetition and routine. I have never struggled with understanding abstract concepts. I would, from a young age, consistently think more abstractly than my peers. For example, I could be sitting in class and the teacher would ask us to interpret a piece of art or literature. I would have a few interpretations in mind but I wouldn't say anything because I assumed everybody else had at least one of those interpretations or something more insightful. I would wait for 10 seconds or so for somebody to offer up their interpretation. Half the time, I would be the only one with any interpretation, and other times, one or two students would have an interpretation that was rather concrete. I would be the only one making interpretations that were abstract and tied into other topics of discussion. 

&#x200B;

In communication, it was assumed that I didn't understand metaphorical language, humor or small talk when I was either bored by conversations or understood the jokes being told and simply didn't find them funny. Sometimes, a metaphor or idiom would spark a thought or an idea and I would try to discuss that. That would be interpreted by my peers as not understanding that they were joking or making an analogy. This is an area where, upon examination, I showed the exact opposite of what many would expect from an autistic kid.

I also never struggled with many allistic social norms that many autistic people mention struggling with. Many autistic people mention that they struggle to understand when 'lying' is expected of them, for instance. Sometimes, I'll find communication guides created by autistic people full of observations and translations of allistic social communication and I'll realize that the way I communicate aligns more closely with allistic people, at least in the way I intuitively understand and interpret social interaction. Combined with how I tend to express emotion and even feign interest out of politeness, many people, including some autistic people and most psychologists, find it hard to believe that I'm autistic. I never made an explicit effort to mimic body language or social interaction. Most of the ways in which I struggle involve a disconnect in my interests and passions. While I've never fit in, I could understand most people which helped me to develop a sense of humor that a lot of my peers could appreciate. I was the class clown in high school.

&#x200B;

I also hate routine and sameness. I get bored of foods, activities, music, etc. rather quickly. I've never been able to listen to songs on repeat and I've never had ""safety foods"" that I would eat on a daily basis. I crave new experiences.

&#x200B;

None of this is to say that I'm likely not autistic. I am. I didn't talk until around the time I started reading around age 2. I've merely highlighted the contrasts I've noticed.  I just wanted to share my experiences in the hopes that other gifted autistic people could resonate, share their own experiences or insight. I also apologize if any of this is unclear or worded strangely. I'm running on three hours of sleep in 36 hours.",0
"What does a healthy student/professor relationship look like? Hey everyone. Lately I’ve (24F in my last year of uni) been struggling with what constitutes as a healthy student/professor relationship. I’m posting this here bc idk where else to post this and I trust this sub! Ultimately it could be a gifted problem and I figure a lot of you know how to navigate university. 

Questions:
- What do healthy student professor relationships look like?
- Do students and professors ever become friends or is that inappropriate?
- What are ways I can reach out to my professors? I get extremely nervous that I’m bothering them 

Here’s my background as to why I ask. You don’t have to read to answer but if anyone has advice tailored to my situation I would be forever grateful<3

CW: Sexual assault

Basically I just don’t know what a healthy student/teacherORprofessor relationship looks like. 
Basically I was raised in a weird household, not healthy. I went to high school at a speciality school in which I grew extremely close with the teachers of my major. They treated the kids they liked more as adults than children and since it was our major we spent a lot of time together. There were two men in particular I was closest with. One of them got arrested the year after I graduated for having sex with one of my friends in my class. After arresting/sexual assault incident THE ENTIRE department quit, like 5 other teachers, all of whom I was close with. The other man I was particularly close with also quit and kinda fell into a depression hole and doesn’t work rn even, I just couldn’t believe it because I had so much respect for him and he has such a strong work/ivy league background. To note, I was extremely passionate about my major and the connections I made there and what I was building, and for it to literally all crumble the moment I left was so shocking. I just felt hopeless especially seeing my mentors fall, it’s so hard to be strong in this world and when the people you look up to can’t even handle it? The people you thought were strongest. It’s like since there was so much lying and hiding it made it all feel fake, what I had built and made me question the fuck out of my passion. 
Anyway, now I’m literally terrified of teachers or getting close to them in any capacity. I’ve met wonderful professors since and just cannot help but run away at small talk or any attempts of bonding. But the sad thing is that I want that bond more than anything. I plan to work in academia and have always related to teachers more than peers. I feel like it’s common to persue your career through professors or connections they’re able to get you. There are so many smart teachers I have that I want to pick at their brain. But for some reason, when I try it feels literally inappropriate and wrong, like I shouldn’t be attempting a friendship with them. I worry that I’m trying to fill a parental void my parents can’t give me and seek validation from my superiors. Obviously I can see the unhealthy boundaries, sexual relations or just a toxic relationship that could happen between any two people. But it’s like…are we allowed to be friends and chat? 

Lol I am confusion 🙃",0
"What Even Is My Memory? Sometimes I feel like I have learning disability because I either remember things or I don't.
BELIEVE me I've tried to nail a consistent method for why some things stick and some don't.

Like I think it's a mixture of having to be interested in the subject and actively applying information on a practical basis. Like practice exams were never my thing, I need an interesting problem or reason to apply this information. And that's not always there and I can't will it into existence.",0
"What could a fun and satisfactory life for a gifted person with ADHD look like? Freshly diagnosed at 22 and confused Hi everybody (with or without ADHD),  


Are there any life paths where both my ADHD strengths and my giftedness can work together?   


My therapist just diagnosed me with giftedness and ADHD. I came forward to him about having chronic pain and not being able to manage life and university at the moment. He took the time to reevaluate my diagnosis of depression and came to this diagnosis.   


Which means my whole life is build in the way where the giftedness helped me mask the ADHD and cope with it. But the pressure of it all leads to debilitating headaches. (Leaving out the details, but you get the gist).   
I need to work on things, be stimulated and engaged in fun projects!   
But I am seriously reconsidering the academic path I am on at the moment (in social studies). Even though I am good at it, the self-organization and self-motivation draiiiiins me and I am not able to show up with my strengths at most times! The lifestyle doesn't fit and I can't hold it up.  
I whish there was a research boarding school for adults.   
Are there any life paths where both my ADHD strengths and my giftedness can work together?   
I would like to not struggle against myself and stay ""below my potential"".   


Help! How are your career paths treating you? What works well in your life because of your giftedness? What do you struggle with? What elements would you not choose again for yourself (maybe college?)? What is it worth it to ""bite through""?   


I would be so happy to hear about your experiences. Thank you very much!!

"How to know if your child is gifted? Some of son's pals were asked to appear in CogAT test. I think my child may be gifted, but I was wondering how to know for sure. While there is no definitive way to determine if a child is gifted, there are a few signs that can help you identify if your child is gifted. He is able concentrate on tasks for extended periods of time and also have an unusually large vocabulary for his age. What are the other traits that I should be looking for?",0
Gifted or testingmom - Which is better for my son in grade 2? My son has been shortlisted for CogAT on the basis of his science project.

"Needing the right environment to thrive to an extreme degree and need ideas / thoughts I’m sharing the following things about me only to explain my efforts in how I’ve been coping in life, outwardly successful, ambitious and doing relatively well compared to peers.

Like most of you I have similar sentiments and experiences in loneliness, nonstop existential questions, childhood trauma like being accused by my teacher of copying homework because they didn’t believe I wrote my own essays, misdiagnosed with depression and adhd, multiple overexcitabilities to the point my life and work can only revolve around it, told I’m gifted unsolicited by six different therapists, finally took IQ tests which is not an issue for me as much as other “giftedness aspects” as stated above are.

I don’t know if this is a consequence of it, but I also struggle with low self esteem and am highly sensitive to sound, light, smells, small disgusting things that look out of place but no one notices, other people’s reactions and feelings. All of these things are OVERWHELMING. At work, I’m highly disagreeable not on purpose but because I come to different conclusions as others, and I’m in an environment where people are considered accomplished and smart. I started writing this post because I just had a miscommunication with a tour guide who told me my expectations for the tour are too high, when I expressed my expectations at the start we’re to complete X Y Z locations and they cannot get that this is my goal that I wanted to complete, when completing X is enough.

Over the years I’ve realised the need to put myself in environments and around the right people so I can cope, function and actually thrive. These come in little bits and pieces, and I’m still learning. For example, I cut out all my friends who found me “weird” and didn’t understand what I found so exciting about my interests. I was always sharing insights with walls. After cutting them out, I felt less sad and hurt about myself. I don’t know if anyone has experienced this before, but I can’t be in environments where I’m thought of as boring ever again. I also changed my workplace to one that is more equal for women so I can speak out about my ideas, and where healthy disagreement is rewarded. It’s hard to find social company that can keep up with me, but I found it a niche interest group tied to my overexcitabilities. There are some issues because I’m a woman and most of my interests only have men in the communities, so there’s a lot of loneliness there but it’s better than being around people I have to pretend with. Finally, with sensory issues, I stated exercising, meditating but I notice that for me to have a good vacation for example, I need to plan to the finest detail, check with the hotels on the cleanliness in advance and only go for 5 star hotels, review the service to not be disappointed. All of this sounds extremely intense but it’s just so on holiday when I need everything to be perfect fo relax, even the smallest things like a waiter being rude or a dirty spot in the hotel room can affect my mood and disgust meter.

Basically, I found out that the way I cope is extremely exhausting. I find myself quite broken actually, super neurotic, my communication with other people is way off but I don’t know how to change it or cope. I get upset on a daily basis because even though i try my best to consider other people’s ideas, I can see the most pragmatic and lowest resource route right away and people only realise this much later. I don’t mean to sound elitist but most people are really stupid in the sense that they waste more resources and time to do something because that’s the only perspective they can see, and they can’t be too open to other perspectives because of unspoken social rules.

I wrote on this sub because I wonder if anyone else is also designing “perfect”environments for themselves and has tips and ideas on how to best cope. My conclusion is that I have to be extremely rich so I can do things the way I want and think is objectively the best, catering to every tiny detail so I no longer feel disgust from sensory issues",0
"Best age to start music? Hi Gifted Community,

I have a 5 years old child who was assessed as gifted (he is very much of a numbers guy. He loves puzzles, non fiction books etc.) I have been told by many that it would be good for gifted kids to learn musical instruments.

I played the piano for many years when I was younger and now I appreciate it as an outlet for self expression. I’d like him to have that too. 

Would love to hear your stories about your learning journey with music or your children’s stories ie. Is it easy for gifted individuals to learn musical interment? If you play, is it a big part of your life? Do you feel like it’s an outlet that balances out your life?

This is just amazing. It's hard to find academic publications about giftedness in the context of adulthood. Academic publication focusses on child education and development, not much about how it's like to be as an Adult, even less so when you weren't diagnosed before well into adulthood and been wondering what's wrong about you. Not to mention when you have a learning disability

The author wrote this thesis after many years of clinical practice (more than 20y, uncertain)

In chapter 4, the author made a survey of litterature for what's available and gives an enjoyable thorough review. Even raising concerns that seemed to be mised from existing publications.

# Highlights

## Preamble

> “Despite decades of study with gifted children, the topic of gifted adults remains underexamined. This thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of the study of gifted adults by shedding new light on what is currently driving researchers’ interests in the topic and what various stakeholders think needs to happen to build knowledge in the field.”

(p. 2)




> “Experts in gifted research agree that there is an urgent need to evolve the field of gifted adults (Dai et al., 2011; Rinn & Bishop, 2015; Ziegler, 2009), and currently, it appears that interest in adult giftedness is growing amongst researchers, clinicians, and gifted adults themselves. However, there is little information about why this topic is attracting attention, the scope of different stakeholders’ interests and the extent to which they align, or how we can build knowledge to address key areas of concern to various interest groups.”

(p. 14)



> “This research and the thesis seek to provide some answers to two related questions: 
> 1. What is currently driving interest in the topic of gifted adults? 
> 2. What is needed to continue to move forward and build knowledge in ways that are meaningful to the various communities of interest?”

(p. 15)




> “My interest in the topic of gifted adults emerged slowly in response to questions in the work with certain psychotherapy clients. Over the years, I noticed that many of the adults I worked with shared a cluster of characteristics, subjective experiences, and narratives but, in contrast, had little in common in terms of age, identified gender, cultural backgrounds, occupations, and family situations.  Some of these clients had received medical diagnoses including depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder (...) and other personality disorders, but none appeared to show persistent signs or symptoms of such disorders. 
> Rather, each told stories about themselves that included intermittent ‘ups and downs’ that worried those around them (more than themselves), a sense of not fitting in, frequent boredom combined with delight in a range of experiences, interests and activities, and experiences of deep immersion in complex topics or issues. I eventually learned to ask about their learning experiences, and uncovered common experiences of finding school work easy as a child, misbehaving or being an exemplar in the classroom (and sometimes both), and thinking well beyond, and often at odds with, the requirements in school and, later, in work contexts.  
> It did not occur to me, my clients, or their referring physicians to consider that they might be gifted, because we all understood the concept to be contextually linked to education and academic achievement in school. 
> Nothing in our training or personal lives led us even to consider the concept. For example, my son was identified as being gifted in primary school, and our family experiences were exclusively around identification procedures based on psychometric tests and teacher nomination, or programming decisions and pedagogy, all within the school context. In other words, gifted education. The term gifted was not mentioned or considered relevant outside of the education system or beyond childhood.”

(p. 18)




> “**Generally, my clients’ questions about giftedness and their explorations are driven by personal interest**. Together, we are curious about what it might mean for them to understand themselves as being gifted, and what the implications might be for careers and relationships. While the word gifted does not initially sit well with my clients, what they read and learn about usually validates, to some extent, subjective experiences that have previously been un-named, misperceived, and/or hidden. **For example, many speak about having deep and passionate interests, and enjoying solving complex problems that others may not find interesting. For most, their attention to detail, absorption in ideas and projects, and (often) resulting fatigue has been viewed by others as dysfunctional and therefore pathologized**.”

(p. 19)


> “Nonetheless, the adults with whom I work tell me that they also find aspects of the published literature about gifted adults disturbing. In particular, they report that the focus on IQ and achievement in both gifted education literature and much of what they read about gifted adults in academic journals is jarringly at odds with their experiences. This is not to say that intelligence and achievement are not important aspects of my clients’ experiences and lives.  Rather, they tell me that the concepts are over-emphasized in the literature and misrepresent their personal values.
> (...)
> Additionally, those who have not chosen to pursue high-status careers report that reading gifted-related research about underachievement confirms deeply held beliefs about failing to live up to some (assumed) potential.
> (...)
> The contrast between my clients’ positive responses to some of what is written about gifted adults and their negative responses to others sparked my interest in what is currently known about gifted adults and, related to that, how ideas are presented in the literature.”

(p. 20)


> “[Despite decades of research about gifted children, the topic of] gifted adults appears to remain underexamined. (...) given the apparent discrepancy between my clients’ subjective experiences and some of the published literature about giftedness and gifted adults, where there are agreements and disagreements in the field.
> ”

"Do you ever feel like people are insane? Like, there is no reason at all to live the way we are living. At all. No reason why the ""week"" should be 40 hours. No reason why ""normality"" is the way it is - in fact, ""normality"" is completely insane, destructive and counterproductive.

Everybody is suppressing part of themselves because they're taught they need to suppress their feelings for absolutely no reason but to conform to nonsense arbitrary rules in order to make it in society. So everyone suppresses their body, needs, autonomy, spontaneity, emotions, etc  to fit into preconceived boxes that are completely arbitrary in the first place.

Everyone passively accepting nonsense hierarchies where basically everyone except a fully abled, white, hyperproductive, confident, heterosexual, etc. man is seen as a subhuman. It's like we collect identities and make a sum at the end to see how human we are. Then you get bursts of social movements when people for a fleeting moment realize they can voice the injustice. Headlines for a week, a month. Then everybody forgets.

People working like slaves in their tiny suffocating individualistic life, not questioning anything, not standing up, ""because that's how things are"", doing perfectly useless if not harmful and destructive jobs to enrich a handful of people who are in turn caught up in superiority complexes and a need for power to mask their own terror of death and powerlessness. Induced scarcity in turn induces competition. No one questions the idea of scarcity in the first place. Humanity enslaved to an idea of its own invention - money.

Then people buying useless and environmentally insane stuff. Then choosing a ""minimalistic lifestyle"" when they find themselves buried under piles of plastic products of distraction. Spending the money they earn in toxic distractions to forget about everything for two days.

Everyone knows that people are dying and there's so much suffering because of the greed of a few rich sectors of the global population. Yet no one really acts to change it or even talks about it at all. Problems are left unfixed. People shrug and they go about their daily habits.

Everyone obsessed by normality and prove they are _______ enough. People struggling to survive yet still finding the energy to fight each other constantly instead of getting together in a normal way to think about solutions.

This is the perspective of someone who lives in the west. But I think many things are generalizable (is that a word).

I can go on and on but it's all summed up in ""people are insane"". I serously do not feel part of humanity.",0
"The shape of a better world As for what a better ""shape"" of the world actually means, i Will be more speciffic.

saying shape is obviously a metaphor, for It does not have one, It is only a function to Itself, a tool where It uses to express something of It's Nature as well what made It's now state possible, the shape is nothing but the sum of the behaviors that are noticible in ANY kind of self growing/complexing system. that is, independent of form or way, It exists alongside the function that inhabits.
As for a better way to put It, society is a function that exists as a byproduct of those lines that mold and select autopoeisic behavior, as well protect and create, essentianly culture and sub-cultural divisional that exists alongside the Nature of humans as a while and It's derivations from the medium where It's creation was necessary.( Sorry for the overly abstract talk)

But one of the questions i am here to ask is, If what i Said is actually what It happens, then is there a way to better understand the most fundamental aspect of the behaviors behind the creation of self preserving paradimes? And If yes, there is some way to translate such ways that the systems use to develop alongside the necessities of It's subjects to minimize suffering and proliferate progress?

It obviously has many similarities to the theory of evolution, and i suppose It tales after the dinâmica between Power and oportunity, that is one is subjective (Power to act upon oportunity) and so inherent to the existence of the subject and the other is objective, that is simply what It is as an envioroment to the subject and the thus outside It's control, except It's predictability that It uses to maximize effectiveness.
It as can be seen an envioroment Can Also be an subject, an individual, formed to act Just as the ones who see It as an oportunity(micro-organisms/macro-organims, similar to a stair that It's perspective of up or down defines It's dinamic).
That of course has limits, not that it is sure what are they, Will there ever be ultra-organisms? Or even planetary ones? The size of plannets and so may live of the energy of the star It exists alongside as an parasite and almost living dyson sphere?

Many thoughts of course, exciting ones and terryfing ones, perhaps both, wich should be even more exciting even tho we haven't even scractched the Surface of what could be beneath.",0

When I'm with friends from school I have to downplay what I achieved so I don't hurt their feelings; they make comments about how they will never be like me and I'll just get all the awards or get into every programs/jobs I want when I graduate. 

When I'm with my friends and family it's like they don't understand how big this is for me. I mean, it's never been tough in school but I was never passionate about my subject like I am now. I feel like they believe it's normal for me to do something like this, like I could go to space and they'd go ""uh good job, anyway what are you doing next weekend?"" (You know the ""yes very sad"" meme from loki? Instead of ""very sad"", put ""very nice""). 

I know everyone seeks approbation but am I asking for too much? I don't want a ceremony, or a gift or a party, I just want someone to acknowledge what I did (and I'm aware it's not THAT great, but it's the best I've done in my entire life). I feel like a narcissist just writing about this.

I am proud of myself, but I feel like I canno't show it and like grades are taboo in a highly competitive environment (and with people in general apparenty). Can anybody relate? How do you deal with others envying you and your family not really caring about your accomplishments because they just got used to it?",0
"Waldorf school for a gifted child? Hi, so I wrote recently about my 3 y/o being assessed as gifted.

It was recommended that we look into special schooling for her. There's a Waldorf school in my area and I was wondering if this might be appropriate for a gifted child?

I just recently started looking into it and idk what to think. It's much nicer than the public school but not like anything that I've seen. I'm worried that it'll be boring. But regular school is so boring too.

My 3 y/o has never been to preschool or daycare or anything because I don't know what to pick. She chills with family all day, reads books, plays with toys, watches tv, plays in the yard. Seems to be fine with that, so idk what else to do.",0
"Gifted child with disruptive behaviour (We live in South America and do not have access to specific resources in other countries)

Our 4 year old son has no diagnosis and has only been deemed gifted with a social delay due to covid isolation, by his therapist. 

(Edit: to clarify, he has been assessed gifted already, but no other diagnoses)

At home we don't have many problems. He's a bit impulsive and messy. But also helpful and sweet. He usually sits quietly looking through his books or plays complex imaginary games with us.

In preschool however, he's pretty much a special needs kid. He requires a special ed teacher to go with him a lot of the time. He doesn't respect authorities, is anxious and disruptive. Even violent sometimes. We have to pick him up 15 minutes before the other kids because he's too much. It became very clear just how different he is at the end of the year ceremony. All the other kids were sitting quietly with their parents while our kid was running all over the place and had to be taken out several times because he was disturbing the ceremony.

He can name every bone and organ of the human body, tell you how a space rocket works and classify every type of marine animal. But he won't sit down at circle time or do simple crafts. He even got kicked out from his first preschool because he would break things, hit and even bite other kids. (There were some signs that he may have been abused there. He told us he was scared because the teacher did something, and would cry in horror in the mornings before going there the in the end.)

I've read that giftedness can be mistaken for adhd because they share some traits. But more recent studies seem to imply it's also common to have giftedness in combination with adhd or autism. Although it seems so much has changed in how all neurodivergent conditions are viewed in just the last couple of years that it's hard to catch up and actually understand any of it as an outsider. And especially giftedness is described as either nothing more than a high IQ, or a complex neurodivergence. 

Also, he's already been evaluated. And covid isolation was extreme here. Kids werent allowed outside during some months, and schools closed for over 2 years. I can tell it's had an effect on almost all kids his age. But I still wonder if it's the full explanation. 

Being smart may be part of the problem, because he uses words and concepts that other kids don't understand. But he's also bossy and gets frustrated easily. He's much too rough when he plays. He gets caught up in the moment and goes too far. And responds with violence if he feels rejected. He's also very much a sensory seeker. He chews up his toys and clothes, and gives bear hugs that aren't always wanted. Things I recognise from my cousins with adhd. But that his therapist says are normal.

It's unlikely that he will be able to get any support in school for either giftedness or adhd. But it would help us, his parents to support him in the right ways.

It feels so disheartening seeing him struggle without understanding. Right now people assume we're not raising him right, which feels awful and isn't true!

Any advice from other parents would be so helpful! (Or gifted/adhd adults)",0

"my child was assessed as gifted We've been taking my 3 y/o to see specialists because she doesn't talk. Their assessment says that she's actually profoundly gifted.

Her doctor says that she needs special care as a gifted child and that maybe this will get her talking more?

"Fear of having children due to my own experiences I love children and would in theory wish to have children some day, but my own childhood experiences have given me pause.

An anecdote: I started speaking both Swedish and German at nine months and at age one I started putting together sentences with seven words. Unlike most, I started rolling my r:s immediately (usually children pronounce r:s as ""j"" here). I was nicknamed ""the talking baby"". While my kindergarten teachers found this endearing, it caused difficulties for me. I refused to go to kindergarden as the other children spoke in a weird manner (""dada and gaga"") and I did not know how to interact with them. Once I stood up in the bed when we were supposed to sleep and asked in a frustrated manner why there was no staff there I could talk to (pretty much word for word). Eventually I started pronouncing words in a similar manner as other babies, though according to my mum this period was brief and I quickly returned to a more ""normal"" manner of speech.   


This is just one example from my life, but there are of course more. At one hand I don't know how I as a parent would deal with a child similar to me - or rather how I would be able to help it navigate society. On the other hand, I am so used to my own way of experiencing the world that I'd not know how to raise a child that would be wildly different from me.   


How have you dealt with this? What are your thoughts? And so on.",0

"Thank you psychedelics TLDR; after struggling so much to heal from past trauma, struggling with to accept and love myself, especially my giftedness, psychedelics have saved my life. Psychedelics have transformed and healed me in was which conventional modalities like therapy and antidepressants were unable to do.


For most of my life I’ve struggled to be myself. I struggled to be confident of myself, to believe in myself, to be compassionate for myself and most importantly to love myself. 
For so long I hated myself. There were periods in my life that for months I would wake up and immediately become crushed by fantasies of killing myself or ending my life in some way. I knew that even in those time while I was alive, I couldn’t sustain the way I felt for much longer. I felt hopeless and helpless.
Years of pursuing therapy and being hurt by therapist, years of trying antidepressants which had no effect, so much time waiting and wasted and it felt like help was never coming. What made it so especially difficult I felt was my intelligence, giftedness and neurodiversity. Such a pain, the feeling of being too smart for most therapists, and those times I met gifted therapists I felt too different.
So in the process of seeking help for so much pain, I continued to be hurt. The trap of my own self hatred and loathing turned the failure and loneliness solely towards me. I blamed my giftedness most of all. It was a tragic irony, so many people would praise and compliment me for my mind and talent, yet I hated what they admired so much. It hurt to consider that someone would say how they wished they could be smart like me, then go home to their wife and family. While I go home and can’t even find someone to pay that understands me. I was desperate for so long, but in time desperation was another feeling I learned to ignore.
My mind, supposedly a gift, but at that time my greasy enemy. It forced all my feelings away, suppressed and ignored. I felt nothing and all I had was my thoughts.
Now things are so different than how they were just a year ago. While my life still has struggle and difficulty, loneliness and pain, I’m no longer a victim of anything and everything. I can authentically say I love myself, I love my life and I love the world and beyond. This state I’m in this beat I’ve ever emotionally been in my whole life. 
I live in an old RV on my parents property. Been unemployed for nearly 4 years. At this start of this period of my life, it was my lowest low. I’m still here, for now, and I’m at my highest high. I believe I had to be in such a disappointing and toxic environment to learn that my external environment is irrelevant to my internal environment. I don’t need a nice place to live or a job to derive my self worth or allow myself to love myself. Any disappointment or shame I may endure will not compromise my unconditional love I have for myself. I don’t need another person or societal construct for permission to for me to accept and appreciate me exactly as I am.
How did I do this, how did I have such a shift and change so much? Most simply it has been through the use of psychedelics. It was just a year ago I had my first experience. And while that one experience was transformative in its own small way, I’ve had a variety of experiences at this point, and that’s been exactly what I’ve needed. When I struggled to be understood let alone helped and healed by other people, psychedelics allowed me to understand myself and become my own healer. I was able to get the answers I needed from within. I was able to face my fears and my demons, fight them in battle and become my own hero.
While many of my experiences were enjoyable and fun, I was never doing this for the joyride. There were many challenging and unpleasant experiences, but those experiences are what I needed to be a me that’s worth being. Not simply to heal, but to become empowered. I found my own strength.
My journey with psychedelics started with a guide in non-clinical private sessions. I tried large doses of mushrooms, ketamine and 5meo-dmt. Eventually I qualified for a scholarship for clinically administered ketamine in ketamine assisted therapy. And most recently I’ve been exploring mushrooms on my own in private. Sure these substances can be used for fun or to escape. But when the intention is to dive within, to heal, learn and grow, so much is granted.
So I write all of this because I’m so grateful what psychedelics have done for me. They have healed and changed me when so much else left me hurt. And it was only after years of trying all the conventional approaches did I become desperate enough to explore such things. So i share this small story about myself, for others who may struggle in living their lives and struggle to love being themselves.",0
"Coping with existential pain Since I was young I’ve always been one to ask myself big existential questions. Usually these are just interesting ideas to ponder, and nothing more. But I feel as I’ve gotten older and my awareness has sharpened and increased, my existential musings have devolved into a sense of powerlessness that causes me a lot of intense anxiety. It’s really hard to go about your daily life when you’re aware of the fallacies of the systems around you, yet are equally aware that you have no choice but to participate in them. 

Unlike with other anxieties, I can’t tell myself that these things aren’t real, because they are. These questions don’t have answers and that reality terrifies me. I don’t know how to calm or soothe myself, nor can I shake this nagging feeling of hopelessness. It probably has something to do with me starting my early 20s and having to figure out my place in the world. But I’m not sure what to do. Can anyone help?",0

 in the begenning of my first year, I was kinda frustrate by the pace I memorize my Paper note for my undergrate medical school(I m in the first year),

When I read my  Paper note of my Lecture, I almost understanding the lesson, only one or three read is needed but I can't memorize (I was feeling not stimulate), for better memorization, I start make a synthesis of what I understand, My memorization sky rocket (30-45 hours to 7 hours)

But I noticed that I memorize even better when I read college textbook in my free time (other no-related field of my study) I can read only one time and I can rembember for  2 week - 1 month (I can be at my rythm and it more precise=>more stimulating)

I was thinking doing that with study related field, but I dont know if it is something recommanded to learn your lesson for textbook, I see a lot of negative thing.

If people can share you thought or advice me on this, Im verry happy

"Skepticism in kids I’m raising a gifted kid (8) and see a lot of similarities with my brother and I as children in not trusting the word of adults. Examples that have come up include: not believing that not flossing results in bloody gums, or that not every kid is going to want to play his games (very elaborate with complicated rules based on games or shows they haven’t seen), or that people think long nails are gross (because they’re constantly dirty and broken; we’d be having a different conversation if it was about gender norms). I’m seeing a lot of resistance on things that either have non-immediate consequences or social consequences, especially having to do with doing things he doesn’t enjoy. 

Like I said, I see similarities with my childhood, but I don’t remember any particular “aha” moment where that changed. I did fine long-term, but my brother still really struggles with learning everything the hard way - through personal and often painful experience, because he doesn’t take advice - and I’m afraid of what that says about my son’s future. And it’s baffling when he’s so smart.

I’m wondering if this resonates with anyone else, and if you can think of things that helped you move past this false self-certainty? I realize there probably won’t be a silver bullet.",0

"Don't tantalize over grades, chances are it means nothing in the grand scheme of things. As a grade 11 student, my biggest priority is my future and getting the best grades possible. Gifted kid burnout has hit hard though, as the time when effort is more important than natural ability has finally caught up with me. As a result, my grades have seen a noticeable dropoff from last year, causing a lot of built-up stress. I'm sure a lot of you are just like me.

If you feel you are sucked out of the moment by worrying about the next \~ 5 years, I encourage you to look at the numbers (not in the way you may think). I created a doc and mapped out all of my grade estimations until high school grad, one being VERY conservative and the other very optimistic. In my mind, the amount of stress led me to believe the difference between the two estimates would be above 5%. It was less than 1.5%.

Academics do not define intelligence or self-worth, so don't waste valuable life on the anxiety of what-ifs.

"Am I the only one who gets bored of people? To explain briefly, I have a tendency to get bored of a subject very quickly. Some take me more time, and some are very fast. 

But this here is about getting bored of people. Today, it hit me that I had a tendency to cut off relationships because of boredom. If that makes sense, after some time, I am pretty much able to guess a person's line of thought. I will fast-forward conversations, and it tires me that they keep being so slow. This caused me to cut off quite a few relationships, because if there is no attachment (and by that, I mean a sense of duty to answer), I will just stop answering after some time. I always feel pressed for time, like a junkie needs to get more shots, I need to get more out of conversations; and after some time, I just let go.

"Gifted with average iq? Okay i’m sorry if this sub gets a lot of these posts but i couldnt really find any other posts that answered my question.

When i read descriptions of gifted kids i find that i fit and have fitted very well in to that experience, a lot of stuff would make sense from my past if i think of myself as gifted. Those descriptions (which i found on various websites) didnt really mention iq but it seems to be pretty big criteria here. 

I took a short mock mensa test and my iq was around 100. I was a bit distracted when i took the test so i might have been able to score mildly higher but the result isnt that surprising because while i am very good at humanities i am pretty average at math.

It’s not just that i’m smart and conflate that with Intelligence, i am good at learning and finding connections its just more in terms of language and humanities and as mentioned before i fit well with the description of giftedness including the more subtle traits (feeling allienated, being very sensitive and curious, always had a strong sense of justice). 

Idk is it possible that i could be gifted? Its not that i want to get an ego boost i just want to understand myself better so i would like to know your honest opinion

"A lot of “IQ” tests seem trainable I took the online Norway Mensa test I think (test.mensa.no) for the first time and it says I got a 138. Obviously I know it’s not the real deal. 

But a lot of the questions are the same patterns over and over. I’ve never done a real IQ test but these seem extremely trainable. The only problems that seemed hard were the last 4 which I had to make educated guesses on while low on time. 

How much does a real test vary from these online ones? I kinda feel like some of the people in this sub are just tooting their own horn thinking they’re special or something. I wouldn’t say I’m smart, I was a CS major at a school relatively well known for the field, and there were those few people there who are just levels above the rest at math/cs. I did the whole math/programming contest thing in high school and college (AMC, Putnam, etc.) and once again there’s a clear distinction between people like me and kids with obvious talent. 

Just the speed at which they pick up new concepts and apply them to new problems is on a different level. I could train/practice for 10 years and still not have that raw ability. 

So yeah people say online Iq tests are bogus and all, but if they’re even somewhat similar to the real thing then literally explaining a few “tricks” to look out for to a normal person before the test seems like it’s enough to immediately get a lot of the puzzles/questions. 

And if the argument is that of course it’s trainable and your “real IQ” is what you get the first time going in completely blank, then what’s the point? There should be some notion of the test where no matter how much someone who is not “gifted” can prepare for it, they can’t do well.",0

"RANT - Lack of activities for very young gifted kids I suspected my son was gifted by the time he was 2 and we discovered he could read.  Though, I was maybe in denial since all I could find was early reading as a splinter skill for autism (had him screened several times- he doesn't have autism).  He is now newly 5 and has been formally tested as gifted, but it would be obvious to anyone even without testing.  He really gets into his interests which are all weirdly academic and I'd love to enroll him in day camps or weekend activities to support his interests but none of the groups ever accept kids with younger ages.  I feel like the whole world just ignores giftedness until 8 at the earliest and fail to make any real academic accommodations until high school or college.  Why is this? Obviously kids can be identified from toddler age.  His current interests are math, biology, chemistry, physics, and space -there are literally no events or classes for his age that aren't coloring sheets and learning the alphabet.",0

"How do you act when someone explains something you know to you? So my way of sharing deep thoughts/the things I know is by starting with the basic information (for example: it rains a lot in that place because there are many mountains). It may be due to masking, or just because it's my way of communication. But what it often results in is some people starting to explain the whole rest of the concept to me (like in this specific example, explaining why mountains cause more rain). Not everyone, but there are some people I know who are just huge ""explainers"" and do it especially much. There are also cases where I ask simple questions (like ""do you have your *own* computer mouse?""), and that person then says things like why do you even ask that, you also use a computer mouse, everyone uses one, etc. Or there might be situations where I want to take the hard way to solve a problem so I can challenge myself, but someone then starts to explain the easier ways and assumes I have no idea about how to do this thing either the hard or the easy way.  

First of all it does often make the impression that these people assume I somehow know less, even though I might know just as much as them. But mostly it's that I don't know of any polite ways of saying that these people do not need to explain. When I use the simple ""I know"", it often results in conflicts or the other person not listening. So how do you let such person know? And after they already shared the explanation, is it worth bringing it up?",0

"Am I gifted? ( I just want people's opinion because I’ve done my research and I am very unsure) I (F19) got my adhd diagnosis 3 years ago, and it’s all making sense because my mom and her sisters are clearly adhd, and my little cousin is adhd too. My dad is on the spectrum and his brothers are neurodivergent too. I know it’s difficult to believe but for me it was normal to be like this, but the more I grew up the more I noticed how different we are from other people. My mom showed me a video of a French humorist talking about her giftedness. I saw myself A LOT and what she was explaining and my mom told me she wouldn’t be surprised if I was gifted. I want people's opinion because I just want to know more about myself. 

I was always very self aware. At 3 years old, I had a very clear and developed language, so much that the other kids were finding me weird. I was also extremely compassionate. I could understand and feel what other people were feelings. I struggled to make friends because I had this habit to talk about very serious and adult topics ( politics, feelings, etc ), and other kids didn’t want to be my friends because they thought I was boring. When I was meeting someone who was a lil bit like me, we could spend HOURS talking about serious topics. I don’t really know how I learned so much about serious topics when I was like 8. I think I was just always very observant and I was listening well without noticing, so I knew a lot about certain subjects and it was normal for me, and the adults were very impressed lol. 

I can understand and feel emotions. I am very sensitive with the way people looks at me, the way they talks, their posture, etc. I often helps people understand their own feelings. I explain to them why they feel that way and all the logistics around it. I analyze emotions and feelings in a very rational way. In my head, it’s an enormous schema. It’s all making sense for me. The problem is, I am too sensitive to this. I feel like I’m too conscious and I understand too much. This makes me prone to overthinking, fearing rejection, panic attacks, sensory overstimulation and this b*tch called anxiety. I feel too much my own emotions and other’s emotions. 

Adults tells me I’m very mature for my age. I see people my age as immature, annoying, unserious, etc. So I prefer being with the older adults so I can have decent conversations. But it’s difficult to understand too much…

I am not extremely good at school, i am a bit less good than the others, I hate mathematics, I hate how I can’t learn like the others lol. I think it’s because I can’t do things when I don’t do it my way. What do you think?",0
"Educating Me Hi all, 

Found out about my ‘gifted’-ness a little over two years ago, recently gained insight to the fact that I am growing past the fase of denial and am now actually quite eager to learn more about said subject. I’ve been listening to some podcasts of psychologist etc, and applying these new knowledge to day life and find that I actually have a lot less conflict in the working area. Hence me wanting to learn more and me returning to this once so dreaded subred to find some more info. 

So YouTube shows, podcasts, documentaries, all of it is welcome! One side note: I’m a science fanatic and can’t deal with any hollistic-reiki-tarot-religious facts. They might have been helpful to you; but they creep me out. Having said that you can always plead your case, nothing beats a valid argument.

"Hi all! How many of y’all are 2E (twice exceptional)? [2E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_exceptional?wprov=sfti1), in case you haven’t heard the term before, means you are gifted - in this context intellectually - but also have some sort of neuro or developmental disability. 

(Including: dyslexia, visual or auditory processing disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, sensory processing disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.)

I theorize that people who are gifted do have a higher rate of neurodivergence. For example, I have diagnosed ADHD which comes along with some fun comorbidities like auditory process and sensory processing issues. 

Even more so, and I’m not sure how much of it is gifted (if any), neurodivergent, or just my personality, but I have more trouble getting to know people and bonding. As an adult, the only people I’ve been able to become fast friends with have also been neurodivergent and/or gifted. 

One of the biggest differences I notice about my communication style compared to people not in the above categories is how I’m either pretty reserved or ‘nerding out.’ 

I tend to hyper focus on a topic for a while & learn as much about the topic as I can until I can have quite extensive conversations. I love to share knowledge with people and have them share knowledge in return. Even though I am in some ways quite reserved, I love learning about other people and their experiences & unique way of seeing the world. That is probably why autobiographies/memoirs are my favorite lit genre. 

Anyway, I find that reddit can be a kind of toxic place, and I have an annoying habit of either saying nothing at all or writing 5 paragraph very genuine essays (always on my phone no less!). Which doesn’t mesh well with many others style (it can be a bit overwhelming for the recipient, no doubt). 

I don’t really have trouble with social cues - more a general feeling of unease around most people. But I do love nerding out in a non-reddit-y way with like minded people (in other words people who have a love for sharing hobbies and knowledge without being patronizing those who know less). 

My experience is that the most gifted people I’ve met are those who are not just top of their class academically, but also highly intelligent in a general way. They tend to be more genuine, less afraid of admitting when they don’t know things, and are less likely to be exclusionary about interests or patronizing when someone makes a mistake or doesn’t know something. 

Anyway, I created /r/indepthaskreddit a few months ago for people who are quite intelligent, but also welcoming, often neurodivergent, and prone to writing essays if a topic falls into their area of interest / expertise. 

if you got this far and any of this  resonated with you feel free to drop by and teach us something",0
Are gifted people just as susceptible to confirmation bias? Like for example believing in pseudoscience like astrology and law of attraction. Thinking that someone behaves the way they do because they’re a Gemini or that they saw a red sports car because they thought of it.

"Let's bury the multiple intelligences With this sub getting larger and larger, it also attracts a crowd that is not educated on research on intelligence to be perfectly honest. In the last few weeks I have read people going on about different kinds of intelligences. This is a ~~myth~~ aged theory that needs to die, especially in a place like this one. 

1. The idea that the brain holds different types of intelligence was founded by Howard Gardner in the 1980s. He theorized that there are eight (or 7, or 9 but these aren't the popular ones) types of intelligence: 
- musical 
- bodily-kinesthetic
- interpersonal
- verbal-linguistic
- logical-mathematical
- naturalistic
- intrapersonal 
- visual-spatial

It *sounds* nice. Everyone is good at something and an individual who fails at logical-mathematical exercises but is generally great navigating life on an interpersonal level would be intelligent in their own right. So especially educators have attached themselves to this theory and won't let go... 

2. Despite it being wrong. 

The theory was *immediately* met with skepticism within the field. Multiple, separate intelligences would indicate low correlation between the types - they have been found to be highly correlated though (whether one subscribes to the theory of the g factor or not) and increasingly so with cognitive testing coming closer to a correlation of 1 over the years. 

There is **no** empirical research to back the idea that there are separate intelligence or that these are some definable and differentiatable types of cognitive potential, which is immediately understandable given that the theory of multiple intelligences is so vague and arbitrary, that it cannot possibly be objectified or quantified - therefore it's not entirely falsifiable either. Gardner has come forth and said that MI being successfully applied by educators is empiric evidence for the theory's validity. However this reasoning assumes the validity of MI to prove MI, therefore it does not qualify as empiric evidence.

Most importantly the key part and why it's generally considered as virtually disproven as far as that's even possible is that the idea of these separate special areas in our brain is inconsistent with the findings in cognitive neuroscience. According to the current state of knowledge, different cognitive tasks share neural circuits. This would mean that they cannot be entirely separate cognitive tasks. 

(Gardner himself has admitted that ""talent"" would be more fitting than ""intelligence"" but that wouldn't have granted him any recognition; the next best thing he's famous for is opposing intelligence as a term all together) 

3. This does not mean that intelligence also defines ability, but ability is not intelligence. This also doesn't mean that we have correctly identified *all* the cognitive exercises that make up what we consider to be intelligence.

Edit: corrected my usage of myth, it's not a myth, that was polemic and also false",0

"Problems of giftedness to which I found no solution for now. Hello everyone! I wanted to ask if anyone here encountered some probles which I'm going to discuss further.

Problem #1: I freaking hate when people talk about things they know nothing about. When I encounter this I just force this person to learn the lesson I'm teaching them, or at least I make them understand that it's better to not mess with me. I use various socially based and other tricks to put them under pressure that grows with time to until they understand my point.

Problem#2: I also freaking hate injustice in any form I encounter. There were many moments when I've started to defend some random person whih was subject to unjust treatment and, optionally, unable to defend themselves. I never avenge for myself really, but if I'm defending someone I can be really violent, and even though usually I put intruders under proportionate aggresive responses and risks but sometimes situation spirals out of control where I use disproportionate in power, very aggressive and/or violent moves to freakin  discourage any further interference. And sometimes this kind of relationship emerges suddenly, very fastly. For example, for some time while earning my BSc degree I was a neighbour of a woman who was abused by her husband who is alcoholic. I've tolerated two nights of fights behind the wall and then I just broke inside of their flat (the door was open luckily) helped to incapacitate her husband forciblyand called cops and local psychuatric/narcological paramedic team, they put him into specialized narcological hospital, eventually they divorced and this man was kicked out of this flat. So frequently I establish extremely intense but short-living connection to some other people, solve their troubles and leave them alone when I'm confident tht the person is safe and sound.

Problem#3: I nearly compulsively gain leadership in any group of people. Usually I gain leadership by mixing up charismatic and expert power types. So basically I weaponize knowledge very frequently.

&#x200B;

For some reasons this state of affairs troubles me. I know that in give circumstances I did the right things, but something inside casts doubts.

UPD:Thank you all, guys for your comments and points of view. I read every one and thought through them thoroughly. I thought and finally recognized that the construction of my personality itself is vulnerable to such problems. So, basically adding my multi-diagnosis psychiatric illness and some traumatization gets me right to these problems. None are about giftedness, and all are about personality and about filling hollowness with problems of others and not my own. Thanks everyone again.",0
"How do you handle feelings? I think through feelings. I have a very, very challenging time feeling my feelings. 

In therapy, today, we were setting up for an EMDR session that had just been making me tear up a bit. My therapist asked what the negative scenario made me think (easy to do). Then he asked how it made me feel, and everything sad inside me evaporated, and I responded ""I don't feel anything."" It was wild how quickly the switch flipped inside my brain and body. This is what I think I've struggled with so much is my ability to shut emotions off so much that I don't even recognize them as ""feelings"" but only as cognitive challenges.",0

"Should I just accept life and move on? I'm  turning 30 this year. I found out I'm gifted only a couple of years ago  and it was an eye-opener on why many things in my life  happened/happens.

As I'm growing older, I'm becoming more and more in tune with my emotions. But I'm also  feeling more isolated, misunderstood, meaningless, alienated. I've had 8  jobs in 6 years. I've lost all of my friends and the relationship with  my parents is broken. Luckily, I have a wife, who is a highly-sensitive  person, who tries a lot to understand me, thinks the same about a lot of  things and is supportive.

I have  this cyclus of existential depression. I'm constantly seeing the  discrepancies between how things could ideally be and how they are. Most  of the time, I'm witnessing injustice, dysfunctions, and hypocrisies in  the world, but also other people's apathy and ignorance. I see how  things should and could be, but they are not shared by those around me.

My  father, who I suspect of being a narcissist, downplayed (and still  does) my feelings, my interests, my achievement, my life in general.  I've been silenced almost continuously and only 'socially desirable  behavior' was allowed. I have the feeling I live my life on 50% of my  capabilities. I now have a high-paying job as a Data Analyst (only  started out as one this year, before that I tried marketing, trading,  accountancy) and in 6 years my gross salary increased with 65%. But I  never tried my best to achieve this, I just went with the flow and ended  up here. I never have had the feeling of doing my best and actually  working my ass off.

I find it  difficult to walk the  conventional life path dictated by mainstream  society. I have difficulty finding true peers. I get bored and  under-stimulated easily and have trouble finding people who can  keep up  with me. I need a lot of alone time to process my thoughts.  Perfectionism and boredom makes me delay or sabotage tasks.

I've  visited 4 psychologists in the past year, and basically, they all said  the same thing: get over it. Yes, life sucks. Yes, people and society  sucks. Yes, it is hard to find friends. Just deal with it and be  stronger. Personally, this was a big disappointment. I feel as if I have  to cope with being continuously depressed and settle in in 'the playing  field', having a conventional life as mainstream society dictates it.  It was as if they all said: stop overthinking and stop being  ""different"". Is that how it is? Is that how my life will look like?  Hoping to find some peace in how I see things and accepting that is is  different from how most other people see it? Hoping that I find some  peers and some friends while I don't have a social life or hobbies or  friends right now?

As they play with the strings of karma and fate,

Taunting and pleading, asleep or awake.

Taking the lead, inappropriate at times,

Controlling the others, as they speak their lines.

The set always changing with each passing word,

Sometimes the silent, the most loudly heard.

Through all of the scenes, director or not,

They all take their places, leaving few empty spots.

They exit the stage when caught unrehearsed,

While everyone thinking that they should come first.

So many are they that the program never done,

All at the same time, they are only one.",0
"growing into giftedness I first got my IQ tested in the 5th grade as a means to skip 6th, so my parents always knew I was smart, though I don't think they knew that being gifted was a thing. They always supported my acceleration, even when it meant graduating a year early so I could get to college. College hasn't been much better in terms of a challenge. I graduated with my undergrad a semester early and I'll have my masters by next spring. I always wished growing up that I had something to challenge me; I was constantly looking at private schools and dreamt of going somewhere with kids like me. I was the easiest of 5, though, and so all that sort of fell by the wayside. Now that I'm an adult I'm trying to make up for my lackluster education in childhood. I'm teaching myself Japanese and I'm hoping to start engaging more with maths and sciences.

"Finding out you're gifted as an adult Hi, first-time poster here. I was wondering if any other posters found out they were gifted as adults and whether the way they see themselves or their history changed as a result. 

I just turned 39 and got confirmation today. I never even considered I might be gifted until a colleague started reading about giftedness and wrote me telling me that she thought I fit the profile. I always considered myself smart enough but nothing really out of the ordinary, just good at some things. I never thought much of my achievements and I struggled to see that other people's thought processes and experiences differ from mine, that they might need much longer to finish the same task, etc. Routine testing at school was not a thing in my country when I was growing up. My mother always suspected, but I always thought that she was so young she could not possibly know and that every mother thinks their baby is extraordinary.

At the same time, I have been trying to explain some of my peculiarities for years. I always felt different growing up and I tried to give myself many explanations, blaming my upbringing, an unusual (for the time) family formation, a very abrupt change of life in early childhood, etc. I began to understand myself better after reading about high sensitivity, but that still left some elements that I was unable to explain. Reading about giftedness made me think about dozens of incidents from my past and it helped me to understand why they might have happened, which is somehow comforting and stress-inducing at the same time. It's also made me feel sorry for my teenage and young adult self, who consistently dumbed herself down and made herself a clown in order to fit in. 

Long story short, finding out I'm gifted as an adult has made me reevaluate my whole life and see many elements from a different perspective and I wonder if anybody else went through/is going through the same and whether their self-perception changed.

"Managing multiple inputs vs multiple outputs while thinking Hello, everyone! I would like to ask you a question about your experience with the manageability of different thinking processes. 

Disclaimer: I am not sure I am gifted. When I was at school in my country assessment wasn’t a thing. There are many aspects that make me think I could be, then other that make me doubt a lot. 

That’s why I am curious to know: if you have difficulties with multiple input intake while thinking, can you still be gifted, or may it point to a concurrent neurodivergence, or does it mean anything at all?

I have noticed that when I receive multiple complex pieces of information, I have trouble with them, unless I manage to merge them in a single thread. For example, I am bad at strategy games because I can only keep track of one front at a time. When I do mind calculations, I can’t retrieve the results of the middle passages when I need them because I forget them. I like sewing, but I find pattern making overwhelming because of the multiple geometric manipulations together with their own consequences (to me, Rubik’s cube is a mystery).

On the contrary, I am quite good at doing the opposite. Given a piece of information, I can easily see all of its ramifications like the branches of a tree, choosing the one I want to go along with and continue to the extreme. I was good at grammar because of this. Just don’t ask me to explore all the branches together.

Does anyone of you relate or know why that might happen? Thank you!",0

"Does anyone else feels this? Heey! I'm a very new account and a very recently discovered gifted person and I have a very serious question.
So... Ever since I was a kid I had this dream of living in a magical library with infinite knowledge where time stopped and all social interactions I would have were with animals, I would spend every single second reading abou everything and anything an learn about the world, this fantasy could just me escaping the bullying in real life I guess, but as I grew older I started to feel this extreme frustration on how I am a human being with a limited lifespan an will never know everything about everything.

So far, my doctor and mom is the only one i´ve talked with so far (over 2 years now since opening up), and now, you guys are the third. 

\- This causes a form of internal loneliness and emptiness that i can´t describe. I do not have   
outer loneliness, I have a lot of people around, both family and friends. But i still seem to struggle a lot on the inside. The friends I have who are close, are childhood friends, and I have not talked to them about this issue and will not. But deep down, I don´t get stimulated from them either,   
and it seems that we are only together on the principle of being childhood friends.   


I really don´t know what to do anymore, and it makes me feel extremely sad that i feel this way (about my childhood friends and people in general). - Can i have some sort of a personality disorder or something in that category?

Have any of you been in the same situation?",0
"doubting yr thoughts vs doubting yourself as a gifted individual (2e or not) I am new to reddit as an active member. 
What I observed in this subreddit so far is, that there are a lot of insecurities present, which I am way too familiar with. I also noticed that I sometimes have the urge and sometimes give into it in a way that translates to ""ok, I'm explaining to y'all what giftedness really is. I also dont give a fuck if you agree with me, cause honestly, you're just not as profoundly gifted as I am. so, we can never be friends anyway."" 
It's funny, isnt it, that we do it here. prove our giftedness, defend it before anyone even allegedly attacked us for being a know-it-all at best, a freak at worst. 
I crave true peers so much, you might call me desperate. I am for sure lonely on an existential level. therefore, I first want to prove to you all, that I am as intelligent as I (secretly) know I am, and you better upvote my thoughtfully crafted post enough (still wonder how many upvotes wd actually be enough.. a million?), so I dont have to condemn you. but.. contrary to how I show (off) myself, I do look for connection. meaning not only no translation necessary, but actually be able to empathize with my peers. 
i believe that gifted people are highly empathic and profit immensly from exchange with peers. most of us just never had this experience where they could truly be themselves and feel safe at the same time and we think we have to overperform to be seen - when did that ever work?
Its more than frustrating to be misunderstood, dismissed or ridiculed bc we dont make sense to some people. realizing that we can cause actual anxiety which has to be met with outright or covert hostility can be soul crushing..
we dont need to behave this way here, do we? 
we are too smart to bully or victimize our peers, its basically self-victimization. we shd help and empower ourselves and trust that we're being understood if we're ourselves.

"Thoughts on Making Friends & Intense Friendships (As gifted/neurodivergent) I often see posts here about the struggles giftedness/neurodivergence puts on making friends and I share a lot of the same struggles. I’ve contemplated a lot over the last couple years why I find it so hard to connect with others while incorporating the perspectives of this sub. So idk here are my thoughts if you’re interested.

&#x200B;

I broke it down to three parts:

*1. Defining Friendship*

*2. Communication & The Difference in Communication Styles*

*3. Maintaining Friendships (Intense Friendships)*

&#x200B;

**1. Defining Friendship:** Of course I started by questioning how I define friendship and what friendships meant to me (my therapist is proud ok). And even above that, defining what “relationships” meant to me, and breaking down each one, my life partner (husband), family members, and in our case of focus, friends. The theory that stands out most to me in regards to relationships is [social exchange theory](https://socialwork.tulane.edu/blog/social-exchange-theory/#:~:text=Social%20exchange%20theory%20is%20a,person%2Dto%2Dperson%20relationship.) and as of now I apply this thinking to all my friendships. So for example, although I will look for a [consummate connection](https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/community/slzctr/stdcsl/stdcsl_triangular.pdf) with my life partner/lover, I don’t need this deep a relationship with friends, obviously. For example, my partner and I have multiple interests that overlap and compliment each other, but my friends I may only share one-a few overlapping or complimenting interests (To clarify by overlapping interests I mean shared interests, and complimenting interests I mean an interest/hobby someone else has that you don’t but can aid your work/interests. Example: I’m an artist with woodworker friends). These interests are usually of use to each of us, resulting in an exchange (of knowledge, labor, etc).

**2. Communication & The Difference in Communication Styles of Gifted vs. “Normal”:** Okay now that we have established what relationships and friendships are, how do you communicate with them? (This is the hardest part) I still struggle with this, but I have one thought that I feel like is onto something. I heard a quote from [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/P-2P3MSZrBM?t=228) recently that really stood out to me. He said: “*I was raised by nerds. Nerds need to interface with society in non standard ways. I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer review and normal purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict so nerds have to learn how to communicate with society at large*.” Putting it in these terms has eased so much tension for me in both what Bach refers to as “normal negotiations” and communicating with “nerds”. I often have an urge to share ideas, new things I’ve learned, talk in depth about my interests, etc. (it’s giving Dabrowski overexcitability) and sometimes people are apprehensive to the intensity of it, especially in “normal” scenarios. Although what I was describing earlier, with finding overlapping interests in all relationships could be seen as what Bach describes in “normal” communication as “negotiating alignment,” I think “nerds” have this deeper self-intrinsic force to gather knowledge to ultimately use in their work or be a source of inspiration. Maybe it’s giving selfish vibes but look I find friendships are difficult, gifted or not. Maybe these are the problems, nerds are selfish and just obsessing over their own interests (but not if you think of creating as a giving act, whole other story, but [this is relevant to that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nje--J7fsfw) thought if you’re that intrigues you lol). I worry about this idea and its heavy reliance on a hobby or an output. I’m an artist and so are most of my friends so maybe I’m confusing a gifted thing for an artist thing, but I’m also friends with computer science nerds and feel it applies. Anyway, maybe this is just an expansion of my thought from earlier, we are all looking for similar interests, negotiating alignments, however these similar interests simply aren't enough for gifted people and we require something more than a pleasant exchange? We need some juice, something we can use later. Idfk this thought is a mess but feels like something.

&#x200B;

^(Last thing if you’re still here!!!!)

**3.** **Maintaining Friendships (And detecting threats of Intense Friendships):** To recap we 1, know what relationships are, 2 know how to communicate (barely) and now lastly, 3 let us *maintain* the friendships. This further expands on the last point, that nerds have these deep interests that they desire to talk about deeply and are looking to gather information as they go which can often be self intrinsic. This may be good for your work, but may not be good for maintaining a friendship. For me, I feel as if some of my friendships have been so intense they’ve exploded or idk. We would get excited and inspired by one another, work on projects together, and ultimately something would usually go wrong. Maybe I was a bad collaborator, maybe them, maybe this is an issue beyond giftedness, however if it does tie to it my assumption is the failure may be associated with this selfish drive. I sometimes get hyper focused on my interests that I push aside what others are eager to express or talk about. I think one possible solution to this is an aim to be more altruistic and put effort into caring about your friend’s interests (which will take *effort*). Your motivation can still at the end of the day be self intrinsic in the sense that maintaining these relationships will be beneficial to you, and if they get something from you (exchange) you will probably for longer be able to get what you need from them. Also collaboration is an important part of creation, creation is never quite so personal as it may feel.

&#x200B;

Dang, sometimes thinking through relationships like this feels so cold, but it’s just reality. We are just navigating through this primate originated extension of a social system and it’s definitely not ideal and a puzzle. So far the tips I have ultimately taken away are: Dive into your interests, see how others fit into that, and be ready to communicate well!

Ultimately I’m just curious if anyone else has thoughts! I hope I don’t sound insane, I’m very open minded and just working through these thoughts. I recently reunited with a lot of my old gifted friends and felt a huge and surprising urge of inspiration and positivity. I think friendships are super undervalued, at least here in America where I live, and I'm curious to solve this issue a little better to have better friendships and be a better friend.

&#x200B;

Also I like using “nerds” over gifted lowkey haha.

"Does anyone else have this? I have been reading and looking through studies lately about ADHD and was curious about a few things. I read a study a while back showing a correlation between the Length of your index finger and high testosterone exposure in the womb. The way you can tell if you have this is to check your ring finger to your index finger. A shorter pointer finger means you had exposure to high testosterone in the womb. I was searching for a connection to ADHD but found there is a connection between giftedness and high testosterone exposure in the womb. I took an iq test when I was younger when I was diagnosed with ADHD and i had a high iq score. Does any one else have this trait.

"Consistency in relationships For gifted people in general, and 2E folks in particular: how easy or hard is it for you to maintain long-term relationships?

It's pretty common among gifted people to switch jobs and interests every now and then because they need more stimulation/ a challenge. Does this also apply to you in the case of maintaining relationships? I'm talking mostly about a romantic/ sexual partner.

Does it come natural and easy to you to be involved with the same person over a long period of time? Do you do anything to keep it ""alive""? Are you fully fulfilled?

Do you get bored after a while? Do you feel the need to chase a new challenge? 

Are you interested in monogamous relationships or open relationships?

(Labeled NSFW because I'm interested to know your thoughts on both the romantic and the sexual aspect of a relationship) Thanks!",0

"The ethics of medicating away our over excitabilities Hey y’all!

I’ve come to a point these past 6(ish) months that I’ve been put on stimulants in order to get my work done (freelance writer). 

I believe this is medicating away some of my over excitabilities, as I have no trouble focusing on things I care about. The problem is that all I can do is think about my interests and spend my days researching them unless I’m medicated to buckle down on work. 

Especially since I’m in front of a laptop all day with no boss besides myself. 

I’d love to be able to pursue my interests full-time but it’s not financially feasible. 

Does anyone else feel like they’re medicating away their over excitabilities for the sake of functioning? How do you reconcile it?

(I am diagnosed with ADHD but am unsure if I agree or not. But the stimulants help me pay the bills, therefore allowing me to pursue my interests when I’m not working.)

"Intense interests, escapsim or a mixture of both? Gifted individuals tend to have ""special interests"" and to feel much more intense about the interests they do have even if they're not particularly special. 

My mind's usually quite caught up in what silly little hobbies I'm currently fixated on. Sometimes I do wonder though, how much of that is just intensity in itself and how much is escapism due to having issues with conforming to a society that wasn't designed with us in mind. 

If I'm not doing all that well from a mental health point of view, not being able to focus on my interests makes me spiral pretty notably. Is that because I need to ""leave this world"" for a moment or am I just more vulnerable to the negative effects not having my stimulatory needs met has on my psyche in general or both? 

What do you think? Do you experience something similar? Are you perhaps even able to talk from a more educated position?",0
"Recently been diagnosed (?) as gifted by my therapist I am 29. Recently been diagnosed, if that's the right word, by my therapist. Apparently my therapist told me that I was gifted several years ago too. I remember it now. I remember that I didn't give a shit because I was very very depressed and didn't care for anything. 

I have very low self-esteem. I met very few people with self confidence as low as mine. It affects my performance in everything. I have general anxiety disorder also. I have so many interests, but I cannot do any of them because of the anxiety and the low self esteem. I am failing at work (I might get a less than 'meets expectations' rating this time) and it's absolutely killing me. I feel like a big failure. The last two weeks have been especially hard. I have managed to keep the existential dread in control for the last few months, but the last 2 weeks - it's hitting me every minute. I feel very sad. Life feels meaningless.

"An apology Hi everybody,

I want to thoroughly apologize for my post yesterday. I was rude and selfish for no reason. I also misrepresented myself, as I do feel quite alien a large majority of the time. We hate in others what we hate in ourselves, I suppose. 

I’m sorry for anyone who felt further alienated by my post. I’m happy to chat in the comments or in PM’s about this. 

I’d like to take responsibility for my actions but please do not attack me. I know what I did was wrong and am already beating myself up about it; I don’t need external sources beating me up too. 

As a bit of an explanation, I have (probably level 2) autism and have trouble expressing my feelings appropriately. This resulted in a very rude post that didn’t reflect my actual emotions. 

I tried to remedy the situation in the comments and in post edits but it got out of hand so I took the post down. 

Context: Yesterday I made a spicy post shit talking people who feel alienated and probably made them feel even worse because I misrepresented myself as well-adjusted. 

I hope the people I hurt will see this and feel comfortable talking to me about it. 

Thank you for reading! I want to be a positive, contributing member of this community and in order to do that I need to own up to my mistakes.",0

"Relationship while being gifted I (F20) have been together with my girlfriend (F21) for about 3 years. Things are going okay and I ‘think’ I love her very much.

I find it very hard to explain what I’m feeling, but I’ll try (english not my first language). 

As a person I tend to overthink literally everything, e.g. my mom is taking multiple flights soon and I’m almost instantly crying because I think of all the possibilities it can go wrong. 

I do the same with my girlfriend. I’m obsessing so much over every detail. I’m questioning things like “how do I know if I REALLY love her” or “why do I feel a bit of X emotion when I’m with her, while I should feel happiness”. Everything she does, I’m thinking about things like: “Do I even like it when she does X or Y??”. 

It. Never. Stops. It’s driving me crazy, sometimes the thoughts go so fast I can’t even state clearly what I’m thinking about. In the end I’m often worrying if we’re a good fit.

However, when I’m really tired or drunk or anything else, I often (not always) think “why did I worry so much, I love her”.

I hope there is someone out there that gets me, since I’m not sure if this is a thing of my giftedness or it’s anxiety.",0

"Is giftedness connected to trauma? Not to brag, but I am considerably gifted. I tested into college English and 11th grade math at 12 years old. I am 15 now, and have been traumatized multiple times early in my life: my grandfather died from a heart attack in front of me at age three, I have been effectively injured by my schizophrenic father at the same age, and a traumatic event occurred in therapy with my father. I also know a person of comparable intelligence who had also been traumatized at age five due to the passing of his mother. He is age 15, and doing calculus III—not unlike me. This had lead me to ask the question if giftedness has a correlation to traumatic events in one’s life.",0
"How do your overexciteabilities show in daily life, what bothers you and what do you appreciate? I'm often overstimulated by sounds and smells or complex lights. This makes it very exhausting when driving to university.
Also, when I'm into a topic, I cannot stop thinking about it. This sounds nice on one side because it brings joy and I learn a lot in short time but on the other side it is also exhausting because my mind cannot shut up about it and everything else is just not that interesting (to the point where I think out loud when half asleep about it or waking up and having an idea and try to prioritize sleep). When I get excited I need! to move or sing to regulate myself. But this sometimes hinders me to actually do what I planned ironically because I only have short spaces of free time in our family's routine (to invest myself into an interest). 
On the other side I love! Listening to music or play with my imagination and it comes naturally, like reading a very good book or watching television but it's fun!

This is just an unedited enumaration I'm sorry but I'm curious what you might have to say!! :)",0

I never got diagnosed. I was too smart to have a problem. I was just cocky and pretentious. Adult would get mad when I’d use a word they didn’t know. I felt dumb. I never thought I could be gifted until my therapist talk to me about it.

It wasn’t just my mom. Most adult in my life (teacher, coach,etc) told me stuff like a kid shouldn’t know that or you shouldn’t read that. You should be normal and have girl interested. They told me that i needed to calm down because i would never have friends. 

But i kept quiet because I thought I was a burden and awful to be around. This followed me into adulthood and I still have difficulty accepting that people like me and like hearing me talk. 

My gf always talk about how much she likes listening to me and how smart I am but I don’t believe her. In my heart I still feel like she’s just lying because she loves me. 

Same thing happened with my friends too. They always tell me how much they missed my intelligence and that every time they see me they learn something new about themselves.

"Gifted x Autism x Average Joe \- I've always been told I write really really well (English not native language), at the same time my vocabulary has always been average. I don't ever recall using an out of the ordinary word when I'm writing or talking to someone.  
\- I can read people quite easily and am very sensitive but all my life all I heard is I hardly express emotions (I guess that's more in the everyday life like I don't show surprise, excitement, etc).  
\- I have a range of interests, am super curious but learning is actually quite challenging for me. I don't learn stuff easily. And my memory is TERRIBLE.

\- I'm a loner, have very few friends and find it hard to connect with other people. At the same time, I never really had any difficulties in my social life, the few friends I have are normal people that don't think I'm out of the ordinary. It is hard to explain. I know how to fit it, but if I allow myself to be myself, most people seem to be overwhelmed (I joke and talk too much, etc.).

but apparently it's outdated since Asperger is now within Autism Spectrum. and the thing is most of what I highlighted in the ""Gifted"" tab are not signs of giftedness but only things that don't occur in autism. For instance, ""Aware of social norms"", ""Engages others in conversation"", ""Interested in team sports"", etc. These are all things most people would also check, which led me to think I might just average, after all.   
I never felt different than other people, or at least I never really paid attention. but the more I research the more I believe I'm somewhere else than where most people are. At the same time, no definition really seems to fit me.

"Vocabulary and being misunderstood. Recently, I've been noticing how often my friends and family stop and ask for the definition of a word I've used during conversation, or simply just stop me and state that they don't know what a word means. These requests can be kind or straightforward, but often are teasing, snide, exasperated, or downright passive aggressive. Sometimes it's an obscure word, or jargon related to my work, but more often it's a word that I feel is normal and common. 

It feels as though it is happening more frequently . I think it might be that I am an adult now, and so instead of being a cute, precocious gifted kid, I'm being perceived as a pretentious adult who is using these words to stroke my own ego or show off. However, that's not the case. I don't think about the words I use until someone makes a comment like this. Then, I become hyper-aware and feel like I have to tone myself down to engage with my peers and family. 

I'm not sure how to deal with it. I feel like changing how I talk would be patronizing. Assuming people won't understand me unless I talk more simply seems incredibly rude, but several people in my life have told me they don't understand words I use or that talking to me makes them feel stupid. The issue has been brought up several times recently, which makes me wonder how often it is happening and not being brought up. I don't want my friends and family to not understand me or feel that I am talking over their heads. It's alienating and frustrating and makes me overthink everything I say.

"How to get through work that's boring My main freelance writing gig is getting quite repetitive. I'm even considering going back to being a groundskeeper because of the versatility of the day, being outside, using my body, solving problems, etc. It may not seem like a glamorous job (and it's not) but it's one of my favorites that I've ever had.

That being said, there are a lot of perks to remaining a freelance writer- one of the main ones being that it gives me a lot of extra time to pursue my interests and work on courses related to the field I want to enter (herbalism). Not to mention being at home with my family, which is truly priceless. Those two things are huge incentives that I think I will miss dearly- and likely regret giving up- if I start working a full-time job that's not WFH.

So, how do I make it through a boring day in order to keep these perks? Some things I've tried (to various degrees of success, depending on the day) include:

\-Using herbalism studies as an incentive

\-Working in chunks with study, cleaning, and workout breaks in between

\-Making my writing as perfect and interesting as possible

\-Looking at the financial benefits of getting work done

\-Writing a list of reasons to work at the beginning of each day

\-Working outside

\-Changing scenery throughout the day

\-Listening to music that's only listened to while working

\-Using coffee as a ""cue"" that it's time to work

And more. But I usually end up spending the day researching what I find interesting instead of doing my work. I wish I could just study all day but that's a luxury I don't have. Finding new clients is on my mind but it's a financial leap of faith that I'm not quite willing to take right now.

Any tips on doing work you don't find interesting? I know I can't be the only one in this boat.

Thanks :)

Like I have worked all my life to get yet I feel like it is not me. ig a little backstory: I was recommend by a teacher to get an iq test, got the test done (twice actually), scored a 159 and 163 then got sent to public school. public school didn't work for me so i got sent to a gifted school. It was very competitive. I actually remember on my first day thinking that it would be fun and I would meet a lot of people but also that i would be better than everyone (yes 7 yr old me was a bit humble lol) anyway the school was not like that. everyone there was very smart and VERY competitive (little me didn't realize it would be like that despite it being a gifted school lol) I thrived academically and wasn't really scared or challenged so to say by the intellects of my peers but I was how ever not ready for the sheer level of ig you could dedication and competitiveness. what i mean is that everyone did so much and we were only seven! Like everyone was taking lessons in multiple instruments, playing multiple sports, writing novels, doing academic competitions, giving ted talks etc and while I was doing as good and even better on tests and stuff i was still really behind when it came to extracurriculars and stuff. so I realized that I had to be better than them. That my smartness was not enough and I needed to be applying myslef. So did it. By the time I had graduated I had learned 4 instruments, won music awards, learn 2 more languages, wrote 2 books, published research, started clubs, ran businesses, created charities, interned at hospitals, played sports, won academic accolades,  won science fairs, competed in math competitions, studied aboard, done robotics and more all while still taking very advanced classes and being in the top 5 percent for gpa. I did, I did it all. How could stanford reject me now? how can I be inferior to my classmates now? I was the perfect prodigy that everyone wanted... and now im here at stanford. I feel like a failure because I don't think this is what i really wanted. What i wanted were good friends and fun. Not a packed schedule and fake competitive friends.  I only did this because this what everyone else wanted. Now idk anymore its to late to go back and I am stuck. My childhood is gone and I am entering an adulthood that I am not ready for. This wasn't supposed to be me. I wasn't one of the kids that would do anything for an internship. I wasn't one of those kids who only got joy from doing and talking about all their extracurriculars. That wasn;t me. THat was my classmates but not me. I wasn't meant for this.  idk sorry if this is messy. I also feel kinda stupid for complaining about this cuz ik this seems like a first world problem lol",0
"How can you not know that you are smart if you are gifted? Every once in a while, I read someone here mention that they didn't know they had above average intelligence before they got tested. I can understand that happening to those who are twice exceptional, as conditions such as autism and ADHD can interfere with performance at school and affect how people perceive one's intelligence. I also understand it when it happens to people who suffer from very low self-esteem, in particular when they have abusive parents or teachers. I've seen it happen. Otherwise, the phenomenon is a little hard to grasp for me.

Is it a Dunning–Kruger type of effect? Sure enough, apparently people in the top quartile tend to underestimate their skills, but if you are gifted (say, in the top 2 percent of the population), you'll have to underestimate your intelligence by a lot to regard it as just average, won't you? Bear in mind that estimation and according placement are cognitive tasks that gifted people tend to perform well. For me, simply pointing to the Dunning–Kruger effect is a very lazy explanation.

Thinking of my own experience, I was told I was smart from an early age, before I could even care about such differences. A little later, it became clear to me that most of my peers were slower, had more difficulties with language, couldn't handle abstractions or reason as well as I, etc. I am not profoundly gifted and have been fortunate to meet people who are on a different level compared to me (though not very often), so it's not as if I were only looking down. Moreover, I was a curious kid who read a lot and so I knew early on about prodigies such as Pascal, Hamilton and von Neumann. I knew I was not that intelligent. But I never doubted I was well above average, and I understand it would have been foolish to think otherwise, given all the evidence.

Another point to consider is that, often, when smart people say they are not very intelligent, or something of that nature, they are holding themselves to very high standards. They are saying they are not as smart as some paradigmatic genius of their predilection, or just not as smart as they'd like to be, not they are not above average. So, while it's something you may hear smart people say all the time, it's not to be taken literally.

What's your take on this? Is it frequently just false modesty? Did it happen to you? If so, how do you explain your wrong evaluation?",0
"Gifted trauma. I don't want to be gifted. I don't want to:

- Be demonized, idealized, chronically misunderstood, either put on a pedestal by those with low self esteem or being put down by those with equally low self esteem but with big ego

- Be out of sync with the ENTIRE system we live in, because it's dumb, it's cruel, it's unjust, and it's boring

- Be used as a life coach by everyone because ""I'm so mature"", ""I'm so sweet"", ""I'm so strong"", ""I'm so special"", I hate this. Who ever helps *me* navigating life *as myself*? Which brings me to my next point:

- Be advised all sort of things, and all wrong, cause none of them freaking understands me but they all assume I want the same as them. They cannot possibly have an idea of the cosmic distance between my experience and theirs. Therapists, friends, parents, teachers, you name it.

- Be pitied and treated as naive because I say things like ""this is not fair"". Apparently only children say that

- Be alone like I was the only being in the whole universe. Finding and thinking and feeling the most beautiful things, being so excited, and being met with a wall of flat faces. Making jokes that people don't get. Getting so goddamn bored because people talk about the same things over and over like a broken record. 

- Not have anywhere to call home. My family used me, my friends don't understand me, I can't find a place is this fucking system.

"Perceptiveness is not well received... In short, people don't like to be ""seen,"" even smart people...so in order to have relationships, I feel like I *must* mask so I don't hurt anybody.
-------
I'm really good at summarizing and understanding people based on minute cues. It's basically pattern recognition. With this, I've developed reeeeally good masking skills and utilized them my entire life, since I can remember. It's led me to useless relationships, platonic and romantic.

So since I decided to try to stop masking, dating has been very not fun. I met a guy who, on paper, is smart (he went to Yale for a PhD in biology stuff; that's supposed to mean something, right?). So I thought, ""Ah, nice, I won't have to go easy on him."" And in a matter of max four hours with this guy, I heard and observed some things that added up to borderline personality disorder; this did not deter me. He told me that before we got too deep, there was something he needed to share. I guessed (because oooo, game!), ""You're bipolar??"" He was taken aback. He did not confirm it but took the convo elsewhere. Days later, he told me mental health is not a joke, and yes he has BPD but has been in treatment for it, I hurt his feelings, etc. And that was the end of that.

So like...does anybody else feel like they have to quell their talents/gifts because majority of people, even the ones that seem they should vibe, are triggered or offput or intimidated by them? Or am I just an asshole?

EDIT: he doesn't have BPD; he's manic depressive (bipolar)",0

"P2 of overuse of gifted [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/znhdjz/the_overuse_of_the_term_gifted/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) this is a continuation and more in depth version of this 

Everything I talk about will be of my own experience and own beliefs 

What gifted means to me~gifted to me is to define a person as skilled or bright in some field whether creativity or intelligence whatever it may be, early in my life I was deemed “gifted” this gave me a sense of purpose finally oh this is why I can’t relate this is why I feel different etc etc in reality that was not the case I had crippling social anxiety preventing me from making friends not because I was smarter or gifted but because I was awkward and couldn’t hold conversation 

Now that I’ve given you a basic sense of what gifted means to me I want to tackle people using it as an excuse 

“Gifted” people using it as an excuse for poor social interaction~ people genuinely may have genuine things impairing their social life but for the majority it is not that case the two most prevalent reason I see for “gifted” people to not have a social life is being 2e and feeling disconnected to get 2e out of the way I’m 2e and my social life is more than healthy I have adhd, mild case of Asperger’s, and a stutter all things that could lead to bullying and I did get bullied but a hard life make a strong man and I overcame my troubles to become social like I used to be jealous of, now feeling disconnected I too feel this no one gives a shit about my interests in psychology and philosophy highschool is not the place for those thing but if I am gifted I should be able to use my brain to figure out how to be social and I did, I was able to split my personality in two and I succeeded I studied alter egos and made myself one one side of me is smart and stoic the other side of my personality is funny, charismatic, and social; if you are smart enough to be considered gifted you should be able to research how to be social and get rid of things in your way using the term gifted as a reason for not being social is a cop out 

I admit I was wrong about there can’t be a kid in every grade that is gifted a person in the original post did the math and there can be so I admit my fault",0
"Why do I always feel like an outsider as a ""gifted"" person? I've never had any problems making ""friends"" and becoming a member of social cliques, in fact I have many friend groups. However, from a very young age, its been noticeable that I'm still picked out from the rest of the group. I am always the number one target for ""friendly"" banter and seem to be their number one scapegoat. For example if I'm playing a game with friends and we lose all the blame immediately falls onto my shoulders. I'm so tired of it. I'm in college now and every friend group I find myself in I'm never treated like everyone else in the group.

&#x200B;

Note: For extra info this never happens if I'm 1 on 1 with anyone. This ONLY occurs in groups. 

Why do I stick out like a sore thumb? I know other gifted people that have been in the same groups as me and they still get standard treatment. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Thank you for your help.",0
What is the sad truth about smart people? (r/AskReddit) ,0
"The overuse of the term gifted Obviously there is genuinely gifted people or we would not have the advances in the world we do. But schools labeling kids as gifted at any show of progression ahead of their peers is unfounded use of the word. If there is a kid kid in every grade in every school that is gifted or deemed as so that overused the word. I believe the word should be reserved for the truly exceptional the extreme outliers of the average bit a kid ahead of their peers by some amount. I was labeled gifted and am mediocre and average at best 26 act and only one of two hard classes far from the heights gifted should be held to I am just average.

Obviously I can’t deem when or when not a word should use but I do however think we can all agree it is overused for kids that’ll be mediocre. but what does the sub think I’m interested",0

"My story: college at twelve # This may seem fake, especially considering the nature of my profile; but is true.

Here is the story of my life, which was not achieved alone—if it were not for many kind people in my life, I would not be here today.

Despite not yet being interested at math—my main interest—I will start this story at the age of seven years old. When I was seven years old, I excelled at reading. I read 300 and 400 page books—designed for people double my age—at this tender age. I would read through these books and come back to the libraries for more. However, I am not as interested as I used to be in the humanities. English has still been a significant factor for what I am today.

When I was nine, I discovered both the joy of mathematics and music—my main interests today. Let us start with mathematics. When I received my student handbook at this age, I saw the back of the book; full of formulas and notations for all grades of students. The notation had me simply fascinated. I bought a math dictionary at my local library fair. In these books, I learned the meanings of notations as high as calculus—for some I only learned the concepts, not the procedures. A friend of my mother's friend was a retired mathematics professor. He started to teach me math *for* ages 12 to 14. For my tenth birthday, he gave me my first graphing calculator and taught me to program. Being a troublemaker at school, I was moved to a different class that fortunately had two phenomenal teachers. They also taught me algebra: simplifying expressions and square roots. Unfortunately, at age 12 these teachers became out of reach—I was transferred to a different class. My family's only choice was to send me to college. At age twelve, I tested into 11th grade math (also taught at the college), and college English—which was unexpected; giftedness in humanities is often subtle. I am now 15 and have been inducted into a honor's society. I am currently taking calculus II, general chemistry I, American History, and music classes. Every math topic taught to me in college seems familiar and therefore easier; I have learned all the notation and concepts, all I need to learn is the methods.

I also have shown giftedness in the field of music and composition, but will not discuss it here since I have final exams to take care of.

"Cross-language ""gifted"" Hi there !

I am kinda curious about this sub. I wandered a bit, and it looks like people here only refer to the notion of ""gifted"". In my language (french) we also have a term like that (""surdoué""), but don't use it at all, as it is quite outdated. We mostly use ""neuroatypical"", as well as a variety of subterms that helps better characterize an individual person (Autistic spectrum, ADHD, High IQ, hypersensitive,... ). These terms all are part of the ""neuroA""  domain, with each one having its own characteristics.

Do the english speakers also use such terms ? 

I am also curious that I didn't find a lot of english literature about this subject, or perhaps it is not as accessible/visible as here ? I would really like to discover other countrys/languages perspective on this subject.

Are there any active communities in the US, UK, Aus, NZ or others, beside this subreddit ?

Looking forward to exchange",0
"Giftedness and frisson experience? Hey gang,

Wikiscience says: frisson also known as **aesthetic chills** or **psychogenic shivers** is a psychophysiological response to [rewarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system) stimuli (including music, films, stories, and rituals[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson#cite_note-3)) that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise [positively-valenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)) [affective state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)) and transient [paresthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia) (skin tingling or chills), sometimes along with [piloerection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piloerection) (goose bumps) and [mydriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mydriasis) (pupil dilation).  

For me, it's very tingly skin and goosebumps, major goosbumps, over large patches of skin, and it feels nice.   I don't get the shivers or chills kind.  I'm a 2E type, so I'm wondering how other people experience it.  I guess people get this most oftenly listening to music.  I don't know if the ability to get goosebumps is even considered a gift?

Some people hardly ever experience fission, others more.  I would rank very high on the 'easy to frission' scale. It has been happening to me for all of life.  I don't get it from music much, but I certainly used to.

"People often misunderstand me I don't know if this is common for most of you, but I assume so.

I (F,22) was diagnosed gifted when I was 5 (+ extremely introverted), and social interactions have always been difficult for me. I make an effort to genuinely smile and be assertive, but there's a pattern: Others often misunderstand me.

I try to be gentle and tactful because I know that sometimes I can be very dry. Still, people often think I'm disinterested, weird, or sometimes rude. I don't want to be the life and soul of the party because that's not who I am. But I want to express myself better.

I've been in therapy for depression and other issues for years, and my psychologist knows I have trouble interacting with others. She says it's difficult for me to connect with others due to giftedness but doesn't really give me options or techniques.

"How do you study? This year I'm doing a degree in Computer Science and it is like nothing I've ever done. High school was easy, I tried two other programs at university which were easy but was bored af and sought something more challenging... Well I got that! Which is nice but now I'm stressing because I seem to have so much trouble with studying!! The longer I try to go along with the teaching methods, the more miserable I feel. I constantly run into problems and things I don't understand and everyone seems to just get it?! I feel incredibly stupid most of the time as I don't understand the simplest things. 

We get weekly assignments for every course and I have so many questions and unclear information that I end up taking extremely long about every assignment. Throughout the first weeks of the period I don't understand anything and I just quit studying because no matter my effort; everything is a mess, jumbled, unclear, frustrating me terribly.

And THEN at the end of the period I finally have the entire overview, I look at the assignment and the solutions, I understand it, remember it, use the information on the test and pass the test. The problem is that this makes me do everything at the last moment and meanwhile I'm wasting my time awfully, throughout the entire period! I feel frustrated all the time because of this.

"Are you ever really happy? Growing up, I was known as a smart kid. In school, I was completely bored and assumed school is meant to be boring, and should not be exciting. Around 11-12 years old this turned into complete apathy and doing absolutely nothing. I sort of managed to get through high school, and only really got into problems at university. I lost a couple of years, and had a very hard time teaching myself how to learn, discipline, etc.. But ultimately succeeded in getting my masters degree. After a few years in industry, I started a PhD.  


If I look back at the last \~10 years (since I really started studying at university), I can see I constantly tried to become smarter, and made career moves to be around brighter people. The idea that I'm underachieving is sort of ingrained, and I keep thinking that I can achieve more and more.  
This process has made my life substantially more enjoyable, but I keep struggling with focus, work-ethic/discipline and most of all, performance anxiety. Deep down, I'm never really satisfied, and often procrastinate (videogames, reddit), and often question the meaning of it all.

I suppose (part of) my story resonates with many of you, so my question is, are you ever really happy? Is it worth it trying to live up to your potential?

How do you manage existential questions?",0
"Highly gifted + ghosted by my industry In 2018, I worked for my first company out of grad school. I had a narcissistic boss, who fired me for challenging her ideas, then told me I am an idiot and should never work in the field.

It is not fair because I worked very hard, and I always worked in the company's best interest and was super loyal. No one believes me because I am highly+ gifted and do not know how to communicate my ideas.

But either way, how does one move after something like this happens? I mean, I decided to just quit the field, but I feel it's so unfair that I got pushed out of the field. Not because I was a trouble market, because no body understood my ideas. I guess the usual gifted stuff. But, dealing with an entire network pushing me out because no one believes me is painful. I guess I have no choice but to let go...

Now it is career time in my life since i failed in school i started working in restaurants at the lowest level. In no time i became a skilled host with a vast knowledge in alcoholic, taste and everything that is enjoyable to eat and drink. I honed my skills in service and hospitality.

"I (23F) feel weird, advice? Last year I went to a therapist about my thoughts. I never felt like I fit in. I don’t like the same things other people my age like. Eventhough I am surrounded with friends, I still feel alone. I never really met anyone with the same interests and way of thinking. I like talking about stars, black holes, medicine, Philosophy, museums, psychology, chess, puzzles. I don’t like small talk. However, I have nobody to talk to about these subjects, or to play chess with.
My therapist told me, after only five minutes of talking, that I am gifted. But she couldn’t be of any help. I never got tested, although I (not very serious and quite quickly) took the online Mensa IQ test and scored 132.

When I talk about random funfacts, my ‘friends’ will laugh at me and call me weird.
I never liked partying, I can’t seem to understand how that is any fun at all. There is no possibility to have a conversation. There are too many people, the music is too loud and the light too bright. Besides, Alcohol is highly toxic, why would you want to drink that? 

There is one guy I know who is also (highly) gifted  and understands me on a deeper level, but he is chronically depressed. I have tried to be there for him during the past three years. But because of his depression he doesn’t have the energy to be there for me in return. He tries to change himself in order to fit in and I slowly had to watch that happen. I sometimes wonder if that is what I should do too.

At the moment, I am starting an MDPhD in vascular surgery. But, as weird as it might sound, I feel bored. I lost motivation and I don’t see the point anymore. My head feels clouded. I also have a strong urge to just go and order some math books. I miss the challenge.

"Skilled yet difficulty working a career? I generally had an easy time of school and college but a 9-5 career feels impossible. I quit my fancy, remote, high-paying job ~8 months ago.

I tried coasting but I wasn't sure what ""enough"" was, so I always felt like I was never doing enough. I was afraid of failure and getting fired (although my boss never mentioned that). 8 months in my anxiety was critical and I couldn't just keep pushing through. I wasn't allowed to do part time so I quit.

I've just been doing freelancing since then. It's better although I'm hardly paying the bills honestly. I feel like a dumbass given how much I used to/should be making/my peers are making.

Did finding this community make you feel understood, less alone? Did it bring relief and peace to some extent? 

I don't necessarily mean that you stopped feeling different or alone, but rather if it felt like a complete answer and like that was the only, ultimate reason for those feelings, and you didn't need to continue to look for explanations. If not, did you continue to feel like there was something missing? Like there were parts of your life and self that weren't explained away by giftedness alone, or like you didn't quite fit in the community or relate to the gifted experience fully?

Back when I was in high-school, I was low-key bullied by the teachers (not even the students) because they suspected me to be exceptionally Gifted. It was not overt, but in sort of subtle ways that they would try to get under my skin (imagine all the babyish things a preschooler would do - side eyes, teasing, laughing at you and the like). I think part of that may have been due to the fact that I got quite a lot of attention from the guys in my school due to my good looks (not bragging, just trying to paint a picture here). Also, I am a women of colour and my high-school was in rural hick country if you know what I mean, so it’s possible bigotry was involved too. I just still can’t believe how much hate some people can garner towards you just for being smart. I was wondering if anyone else has experiences with this and what you did in that situation.",0
"Struggling with college structure and demands I am struggling with the demands and structure of the college environment and I thought you all might be able to offer some advice. In the last year, I have found out that I am gifted and have ADHD. I love the academic environment for the learning and stimulating atmosphere but I continue to struggle with having to color inside the lines and meet constant deadlines. I have been at CC for the last four years and just transferred to university this semester. I thought things would get better once I was taking mostly classes for my major because they would be more interesting—and they are. I also joined Honors so I could write a research thesis, which I’m also enjoying but there were a lot of more hoops to jump through than I expected. I’ve also been trying to get accommodations but the accommodations they want to offer (lecture recording, basically) won’t help for what my struggles are, and the things I think would help (flexible deadlines) they don’t want to give me. Here are my two major issues:

1) Having to do everything the way I’m told is demoralizing. I am a creative person and like to do things my own way, coming at them from angles other people tend not to think of. When given the freedom to work in my own way, I work at a graduate level but being forced to do menial tasks with what seems like ridiculous requirements is SO frustrating and makes it feel pointless to me.

2) I get super overwhelmed with the amount of tasks I’m expected to do, constantly churning out one assignment after another without any time to actually sit with anything—things I actually do enjoy and want to learn.

I want to go to grad school desperately. I love learning more than anything. But I don’t know how to keep up with these expectations. My mental and emotional health are suffering. If there are any divergent thinkers out there who successfully made it through college with some mental health and dignity in tact, I would love some advice. I’m getting really tired of feeling like “too much” all the time.

"Adult but not slowing down Is anybody an adult who is not slowing down? I feel like I only want to do and learn more and more and more. 

I was always a curious kid. I remember when I was young, and I would jump from this topic, to that one, read this book, start writing a book, collect this, collect that. I was always a ball of energy in one way or another.

Then I lived a sheltered life which was very incompatible with who I am. People around me tried to force me to be their idea of what a smart person is so I didn't do much in my younger years. I was to produce grades and not much more. 

The overcontrol and sheltering only made things worse. There is so much I missed out on. Much of it I could've been doing 20 years ago. I think that people think if I they stop me from doing things or discourage me, then I'll stop being myself. I am not a piece of clay to be molded.

I'm glad to be curious and energetic, but I understand this makes me a bad adult. Imo some people think adulthood is for working ones life away and then doing tidbits of what you actually card about. I'm not a good employee anyway. I burn out after 2 days of real work. Most people would call that lazy, but I'll work like a dog and even through injuries if it's something I want.  Yesterday someone got on to me for my gig job. No, I don't have benefits, but I had few benefits at my real job either bc I can't stand working full time. I understand there are downsides to working gig economies, but not being myself (active and creative) hurts me. 

One lady I look up to is a professional performer part time and does door dash to supplement her income. She's not by any means rich, but she has the life I'd love to have.

I am a job hopper i have done so many different things and every time it ends the same way.. the last burnout is taking to long i am now in it for 2 years and i really feel my fire is going out and time flying by fast and it frightens me. 

I am a school dropout with a bad past, i would say i am the underachiever. I figured out very recently for 95% sure that i am gifted and i am now getting tested for it. 

The thing is i dont care about the whole label gifted and the IQ score but i dont know if it is the right thing to do. I just need help with how to use it properly.

I realise from people i have to tell i am gifted or institutions that they fuck around with it saying it shouldn’t be a problem, are you sure you dont come over to me as a genius? why would you like to know it doesn’t add any value or the smart people we had in the company work hard and have no complains at all, if you are gifted you don’t need help you know how to figure it out yourself or have no idea what you talk about and see you as an obstacle. Not to say that i am very open about it not at all but when problems arise that i have to explain my way of thinking i see they don’t understand and then sometimes i have to say it.

Im so tiered of proving myself over and over again and self sabotaging myself. And having to adjust so much.

At this point i feel delusional but i am not i know it deep inside i heard it from many other people before in the past and just swept it under the carpet me gifted!?? Pfft i have a F for mathematics and absolutely hated school. For a reason.. i was bored as hell and misunderstood and became rebellious.

I have been through a whole list of psychologists and psychiatrists and they actually didn’t help at all. It felt more like a punishment from misunderstanding and the half hours they have per two weeks is to short to really make them understand even if i notch it down it gets misunderstood. I have been called lazy, arrogant, etc and always leads to going back to work solves everything… im the absolute opposite and thats the whole reason why i am in this situation.

"Gifted test analysis Hi everyone, I posted here a few months ago about my son being referred for gifted testing. I myself struggle with testing so I came to ask if I should do any prep with him- everyone pretty much said no prep is necessary. We got the ([results](https://imgur.com/a/hx4l4Z6)) on Monday and I was asked if I want to transfer him to gifted asap or starting 3rd grade. I decided the latter. I am in the process of starting a new job (hopefully within the next month) and I don’t know how much I will be around to help him with his homework after school. Math is a weaker subject for him and I’m thinking to use a math app for him to earn screen time. If anyone can refer some solid online resources, I appreciate it. My goal is to help him solidify understanding of what he learns in school and to feel positive about it- not that school is a hassle.",0

"Parent of a gifted ADHD child looking for some advice Hello,
   Thank you for checking out this post. My 7 (almost 8) year old son was clinically diagnosed as both gifted and having ADHD. This is our eldest child so some of what we're dealing with may be due to inexperience on our end. We are trying to determine if his personality traits fall inline with the above diagnoses or if there is something else we need to identify. All advice is appreciated.

Going to refer to my son as Fred (not his name)

Fred is entirely caught up in his own world. He is ultra focused on 2 or 3 different things. Mostly related to games, imagination. 

Fred has a tough time playing with other children because he wants to control every aspect of games. He has a wonderful imagination and ability to make games very interesting but refuses to allow others to control aspects of the game. 

If Fred is forced into a situation where other kids want to do something other than his ideas/games he is happy to wander off and play by himself or another group. He's not particularly attached to friends but seems to enjoy time around them. He may have one or two really good friends over groups of them.

Fred has a hard time reading people. He gets very emotional when he realizes that something he did upset someone else but doesn't often see it beforehand. He is very blunt and will tell a waiter the food took too long to arrive if we're not careful.

Fred often prefers the company of adults over other children. He will chat up random adults he see's before even considering playing with a kid he met at the playground. He's not shy.

Fred is chaotic good. He will absolutely follow the rules to a tee and will not allow people to cheat. If I speed a few km over the limit while driving he will let me know.

Fred's teachers have all said they love him in class and that he's very helpful to other children when asked. 

Fred almost never gets invited to birthday parties or play dates.  

These are just some examples of what we're seeing. We want to help guide him towards becoming a well rounded individual. We are on the fence about exposing him to more doctors to see if there's anything underlying that we should address. I'm hoping to get some insight into that. Thank you!",0

"Having Energy to Think Bear with me as I tease out my current, specific situation, before moving to the general question as it relates to being gifted.

:::::::::::

Recently, with a new position at work, I've (25) been so deeply engrossed in my work that I no longer feel like I have the energy to think deeply about things. It is so difficult to just sit down with a book or to study anymore.

I am a teacher at a high school in a foreign country, recently moved from a primary school position. I probably spend a good, full 5-7 hours a day lesson planning and 2-3 hours teaching. This position has been extremely demanding on my creative, logical, and decision-making processes such that I no longer have much energy to think outside of work and making a good experience for the students. The work of education is intellectually interesting for the sake of figuring out how to perfect my craft, but that's it. Once I am sufficiently proficient, it too will pass from my curiosity, I fear. The tedium of keeping up with the excess work is detrimental too, I think.

This is all on top of a fuller social life with the move I had made out of home about a year ago now. Most conversations with others revolve around work, drama, and other futile exercises in keeping the mind busy. People who enjoy curiousity and discovery for their own sake are strikingly few and far between, and most are bogged down in struggles (emotional, of maturity, philosophical, etc.) that I feel like I've moved far past. It's difficult to appreciate these kinds of people anymore, and yet I still feel drawn to them in some more baser sense. A friday night at a bar with pizza and cocktail in hand in some other universe, shooting the shit.

This life so far, though so full, feels so empty.

Compared to my life before the move, during covid (the first 2 years in the US*) and even in college, I no longer have much time nor energy to deeply think and consider the things I used to care about intensely, including in language learning, philosophy, history, sociology, and so on. I love doing these things. While the experience here at this place of work and this country are greatly beneficial to me, I can't help but feel I am losing part of myself to the environment,  the people, and the work...

:::::::::::

Here's where I pass the ball to y'all -

How do we preserve what makes us gifted in the face of life?

I've been thinking a lot about things like overexcitabilities lately - how do I continue to remain bewildered by and to foster the senses, the intellect, the imagination, emotions, and body in general when the life around us seems to dampen them at every turn? I feel like they are atropheing. They are being crushed under the weight of life.

To abandon my social life? To change my line of work? These measures would be too drastic, but the less radical alternatives are not clear to me.

To force myself through a book in my down time, or to wander the streets aimlessly, waiting for my mind to bite some hook? I can't really do these things well unless inspiration truly strikes.

:::::::::::::

I believe this kind of worry is not one only borne by myself. I'm looking for some perspective, some experience of going through this perhaps inevitable part of life.

Thanks for any pointed comments.",0

"I'm sure I figured out quantum entanglement, after 3 days of thinking about it! So, the story is, I'm an engineer who does engineering work.  I don't know a thing about quantum physics, but I was forced to consume a few papers that came out recently.  I'm researching to compile a list of reasons why quantum cryptographic key distribution technologies are probably not going to work out.  Trying to work out of 'cost of cohesion' and what it might imply for TCO of different systems, normal engineering stuff.  Anyway, I had an interesting notion occur to me during the research.  I have thoughts and questions. I'm not narcissitic to think I'm right, but I'm smart enough to still ask the questions anyway, even if I look stupid.

What do we do when have interesting ideas that are totally out of our field?  This is my actual question.  I don't know any quantum researchers to ask.  I have a feeling there might one or two amongst this set of folks, so I thought I'd share this here.

I was trying to figure out a way to describe how we entangle particles, what they do, and what really happens in reality, but for engineers.  Then my stupid brain spit out a notion that conforms to what's what's called the ""hidden variables"" theory and explains away the spooky part of entanglement.   Apparently some people think entanglement can be explained by adding a 5th dimension to reality(Einstein was curious), but why do we need to add anything to our 3 dimensions and time.

The Feynman diagrams seem to hint at a particle having a quantum state in 1 dimensional space over time.  Particles are obviously real and flying around all over the 3d universe, it's only when we create conditions to that isolate atoms and particles do we seem some emergent quantum behavior.  You can excite an atom of rubidium by shooting it with a laser such that it creates two new entangled photons when it calms down.  Both photons are ""born"" entangled to the rubidium atom, until some other particle's quantum state crosses the timeline and messes it up. Because their quantum states were created in 1 dimension, they are spinning next to it's parent rubidium atom quantum state, regardless of where the particles go in 3d space.  They conserve angular motion because of this adhesion, which could simply be something like weak quantum gravity.  They are entangled in a ""non-local"", yet still related, dimension.

I'm very interested to hear the opinion of somebody who actually researches the field, but what if what we see as entanglement is just the result of a 1 dimensional quantum universe?  Every particle has it's own unique quantum state, and they exist in lower dimension space and are sticky, but not strongly adhesive.  In that reality, there are only 1 dimensional quantum states, altered by 1 dimensional quantum interactions and separated by spacetime gaps.

I guess that would imply the universe to be entirely entangled, we're just seeing what happens for brief periods where we isolate the particle group, until they rejoin everything else?  I assume to be wrong, as this does imply the idea that ""we're all connected"" is actually provably true.  Nobody wants to listen to a bunch of gloating hippies.  It certainly doesn't imply anything about the existence or non-existence of God or some guiding force, which is where these kinds of debates often wind up.

Any actual quantum scientists in the group?  I asked over on their subreddit, and it's been crickets.",0
"Do you recognize these feelings? How do you cope with them? As a child, I've always felt lonely. I had to pretend to be someone else in order to fit in, to be accepted. As far as I can remember, I never 'really' felt like a child although I acted childish to overcompensate. I was only able to respect teachers if they treated me like an adult or an equal. My parents felt that there was something ""off"" with me, and I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. I resisted that diagnosis from day one, as most symptoms did not apply to me. I had to take medication for years on end, which made me feel numb and not myself. The medication and all the years of pretending to be someone that I am not have made it incredibly difficult to be myself. To know who I really am. I feel like there is something 'deeper', a layer underneath everything, that is very hard to reach. Who am I? Which parts are real and which parts did I make up to fit in?

Later on, I learned that ADHD is a common misdiagnosis for people with HSP and giftedness. Learning about those two things has made a lot clear about myself. Now I know why I seem to feel every tear, every bomb, every bullet. Why I feel the pain that others feel. Why I feel an intense love for others whereas I am constantly frustrated by how poorly we treat each other. I finally understand why I did not have to do much effort in school. Why I felt like an imposter during the PhD but why the PhD did not felt like an achievement afterwards. I reach milestone after milestone, but I feel almost nothing. One achievement is simply a step to the next one. It never feels like it is enough, and no achievement is able to fill the gap that I feel inside. Why it is so hard to be proud about any of those things. I don't think I've ever been proud about anything. When my first relationship of five years ended, I was depressed for three years. I cried myself to sleep every night, it felt like I would die from pain. When I love someone, it runs through every atom of my body. But even now my depression is gone, I cannot say that I have ever loved myself.

And yet, people sometimes state that I can be perceived as arrogant. But I am not arrogant. I am so, so, so unbelievably insecure. But if I don't know myself, how could they possibly know me? I still feel lonely, even though I have a great family, good friends and a partner that I love very much. But I can feel incredibly guilty. Guilty because I can get incredibly frustrated when I have to explain something twice. Guilty because I can feel incredibly sad and full of pain for no reason whatsoever.  Guilty because I never had a partner who stimulated me intellectually, which I crave so much. I love her enormously and yet, I miss a deep connection. She understands that I am ""smart"", but she has difficulties to understand what I feel due to the HSP. Sometimes I am afraid that I have to amend with the fact that I am an outlier and that my partner will never truly understand me.

"Taking care of your brain Hi! What are your ""secret"" methods of taking care of your brain including nutrition, dealing with overload, keeping your life fun and balanced, dealing with stress, and perfectionism, and so on? Recently, I have decided to accept my difference as a part of myself and to stop pretending being normal. I would love to find ways of taking a better care of my brain, because during last years, I wasn't really taking care of it. I would love to get back where my brain activity and creativity used to be, because I really often feel like being ""muted"" and my ideas feels too useless to be thought thoroughly. Also, I am quite insensitive when it comes to other people's feelings. It didn't use to be this way.

So far, I have discovered these methods:
- meeting with friends regularly and often
- trying to sleep enough (I've been failing in this one since childhood, but I do my best)
- exercising
- working
- spending time alone
- being kind to myself and others (this one, I am failing as well)

I am considering methods such as these, but I haven't tried them yet:
- drawing during my mathematical days to relieve the tension
- eating sugar when my mental activity drops (I am not sure about this one)
- eating seeds and nuts on a daily basis
- doing more of the useless stuff that makes me weird on the outside but happy in the inside (like solving a Rubic cube)
- maybe some kind of training of memory and/or skills in studying itself?

Please, let me know, if I am overthinking it.

"Why is literally every close friend I have a genius? TLDR; my closest friends and exes all tested 140+ on empirically valid in person tests. My sister just got tested again and got 148. We used to have the same scores that weren’t in the gifted range. How do I know so many people in the 1%? Do friends gravitate to people of similar general intelligence? Or how else am I finding them and they are finding me?


My partner studies intelligence in grad school and it’s brought something back circling through my mind that doesn’t seem to make sense. 

Literally every single close friend I have as an IQ of over 140, tested in school. They’re also twice exceptional except two. Statistically that seems highly improbable. 

My closest best friend has an IQ of 151 tested in elementary. (ADHD and probably ASD)

My best friend from high school before her had an IQ of 163 tested in middle school and another time after that. (ADHD and ASD)

My closest friend post grad school just told me her IQ is over 140. 

Two of my exes (and now lifelong friends) both also have an IQ of over 140. One with ADHD

My current partner has not been tested  but as he studies IQ people are mentioning they think his is very high and he’s decided against pursuing his own assessment. (Because we really shouldn’t take this too seriously.)

Aren’t people 140+ supposed to roughly make up 1% of the population? 

What makes matters more jarring for me right now is that I’m realizing there might be a genetic disposition to me being used to giftedness too. My cousin grew up as the “child genius” memorizing his marine biology college textbook and quoting from specific pages when he was 3, so by contrast all of us felt we were, well, not geniuses. I think his IQ might be in the 170s. My siblings and I were tested as kids a couple times and the the one just a bit younger than me got the same scores, 119. Both of us are also neurodivergent. 

As a personal note, I used to be so frustrated because I was so deeply bored in class that I’d feel my youth was being wasted so after school I’d just spend time in my room actually learning on my own. I would read descriptions of being twice exceptional and cry because it sounded so much like me. Just as a couple examples, I could clearly rhyme before I could speak at 7 months by pointing (like pointing to a buckle and then a  knuckle etc.) In middle school math class I would draw diagrams depicting my developing model of reality and the cyclical nature of our universe and became staunchly morally relativistic. I’d always quickly get the concept of things and be able to have higher level discussions but would struggle with little details like writing down the wrong number absentmindedly or finding the right string of words because I think in pictures and videos.  And I was known in class to ask the questions nobody could answer. But alas, I didn’t really fit into any group in order to get the support I needed to feel I was being challenged. And I felt socially isolated as well. Well long story short that same sister just got retested and now her score is 148. Her processing speed is slow because of the ADHD. And it stirred all those old feelings again that perhaps other neurodivergent family and myself fell through the cracks.

I don’t want to get retested because any score would result in pain for me. I’d prefer to have a lower score if anything because at this point in my adult life there are no supports to encourage my intellectual growth anyways and my brain has not helped me feel mentally or emotionally connected. I’m happy with the few friends I have and our conversations are stimulating and fulfilling.  But now I’m wondering how it is that there are so many geniuses in my life. 

Am I just an intellectual pet who happens to be interested in abstract theoretical topics and therefore I attract people who are more prone to abstraction?  I always feel we’re on a pretty even playing field but maybe they’re humoring me. Am I attracted to twice exceptional people because they’re what’s familiar? What’s the common denominator? 

Any insight from this community would be helpful. You’d think this is something my partners masters would have touched on but it isn’t.",0
"Incertainty about looking for diagnosis/medical support Hi community!


For years, or maybe for as long as I remember, I've been struggling with certain aspects of myself. Sometimes, I think it might be giftedness, but everytime doubts hit me. Am I as intelligent as I feel? Are there other explanations for what I'm experiencing?

I never had much trouble in school, worked hard but not excessively, and was usually below the top students. But I learn quickly and have very broad interests.

Now the things I struggle with most of all is the feeling of frustration when my peers make - in my opinion - stupid decisions, or overanalyse everything instead of just doing what needs to be done. Sometimes I wonder how they could have the same job as me (I'm a pharmacist btw). I have switched jobs before because of this. Could that be because I'm simply more intelligent, or am I just a narcissist?

I hesitate to mention it to my GP, because I'm afraid it will turn out to be quite different than I would expect.

"Am I really gifted? Tomorrow I will be turning 17.

I am currently in high school and am the one of the, if not the, top student(s) of my class of 400 students in a very famous school in India. However, I am in perpetual doubt about my abilities. 

I got 133, 135 and 133 on mensa.no.dk and.fi respectively with a 136 on mensa.lu. I also did the tri 52 and got 805 (~137.7). On the cait, 142-143. And around 140 on all pro tests in the cognitivetesting wiki. 

Ever since I was a child, I showed signs of intellect to my home tutor who had commented that I have a sharp brain. Also I would dissect each and very toy I would get to look what was its inner mechanism. 

BUT I showed no signs of what a traditional gifted child would show. No early speaking. I am not much interested in reading and my reading speed is merely average. I also act very dumb at times. My father used to literally bully me saying that I was not clever when I was 6. 

My grades were great in elementary school but dropped to failed grade when I shifted to my current school. In grade 5, after my lowest point, I got serious in studying and became one of the best students. I topped the entire class several times. I taught myself a bit of programming (python) in grade 6 when I got access to a computer but it was not something very extraordinary. I can solve pretty much any programming problem that my teachers give if given time. When I was 9, I  discovered zeno's paradox and my childish mind had thought that I had discovered something new when actually it was a concept that had existed for years. 

Recently I have been diagnosed with mild OCD, subclinical level depression and anxiety. I have been into some philosophical conflicts for some years and am undergoing therapy. They tested me using Weschler Bellevue Intelligence Scale(WBIS) test costing around $12. I got 128. I was a bit depressed after that score. I feel I underperformed on that day as I was recovering from cold. I can easily remember 9 digits fw and bw but the performance was merely 8 on that day. My performance varies, I have discovered. 

My mental calculation speed is also slow. But I am good at math in the sense I can easily comprehend it and apply it. For example, I discovered the 'counting rule' of permutation and combination all by myself when I was in grade 6.

I am stopping here. Please try to resolve my doubts and be honest. If you require any more info feel free to ask in your comment. 

Thank you.",0
"How often do you feel that everything is too superficial and without substance? I'm studying about common complaints that gifted individuals have and I want to ask you if it's common and frequent the feeling of superficiality/shallow, things ending too fast, not having enough development or complexity to the point of becoming a problem, an annoyance or impediment in everyday experiences such as watching movies/documentaries, listening to lectures, reading books, talking to friends, etc.

"toxic manifestation of empathy? Hello,

So I've thought for a while that the ""heightened empathy"" doesn't apply to me but, I've noticed that whenever people in my family are trying to persuade me of something (lately the Ukraine situation), if they say words with an emotional inflexion, I cringe from fighting an internal battle to stop the words from affecting me.

"Can life circumstances like seizures or psychosis lower IQ? Hey everybody!

Upon recommendation in a comment on another post, I took the following test:

[https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/)

NOTE: I am not the user who this test was recommended to, I just saw the comment and figured why not.

And...I got an overall FSIQ of 98. My official IQ test came out to 136 but that was in early elementary school.

A lot has happened in my life that- and I don't know this for sure- may potentially drop an IQ (serious seizures and EXTREME psychosis. I can elaborate if need be). I don't know if there's merit behind this but I've certainly been...slower since my years of incapacitation. Does anyone know if there's any factual evidence behind my theory?

The online test itself even recognizes that online tests aren't accurate. But that seems to be the most reputable one based on my gatherings. And if I'm truly gifted wouldn't my score be at least...not 98?

Admittedly, I didn't really take my time with the test whatsoever. But still.

Sincerely,

Identity crisis officially unlocked

EDIT: I just found this at the bottom of the test intro page: ""There is not much benefit to taking a super long time on the test, but if you speed through in less than 10 minutes your scores will be much lower than they would otherwise be."" I definitely sped through in less than 10 minutes. So who knows.",0
"IQ and Giftedness Edit: [new test results - age is not taken into account](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/results.php?data=HRY141dcc7JH)


Generally, a gifted person is defined with iq in the 98th+ percentile. I am just turned 15 few weeks ago and I did a Mensa IQ test in person last month where I scored 76th percentile for Cultural Fair (I did it in England but I was born in Hong Kong, so English is technically my second language) and 75th in Cattell B Scale (again, I don't take this as serious as it is not my first language), so by definition, I am not gifted. However, when I was fairly younger, I was nominated by my year 6 teacher (5th grade for those in the US or other part of the world) to a gifted program HKAGE, so I am confused now... Therefore, I thought I am just give some observation and see what this subreddit thinks.(Please note: [this is an update to an old post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/w9mrik/maybe_i_was_never_gifted_or_is_this_imposter/))

For:

* I have strong academic interest:
* I was promoted to a year 12 Music class instead of my regular year 10 class
* I am doing some A level maths in my free time (year 12 or 11th grade)
* I am 5 topics ahead in maths class (my teacher tend to give me next topics when I am done with one)
* I also enjoy learning quantum physics or any physics in general
* I like doing maths problem during my free time
* I was in a gifted programme called HKAGE in Hong Kong
* I am usually ahead of my class in maths, physics and music
* I have common gifted ""syndrome"":
* I get easily upset by poor grades
* I am usually the fastest to finish in class tasks with good quality work (according to teachers) in most subjects and teacher would often tell me to slow down.
* I sometimes feel bored in class (it is more like I want to ""fast forward"" the lesson like a youtube video)
* I generally find my use of language rather formal and advance to a certain extent comparing to my age group. For instance, I got 13 in terms of my fog index with my Reddit comment history.
* I have a strong sense of justice and I feel offended when people are not following rules which can often lead to me feeling negative intense emotions
* I struggle to relate with my peers (but I suspect that might also just because of my poor social skill, selective mutism, autism and social anxiety?)
* I am somewhat logical for most of the time.
* I was part of my primary school's STEM competition teams and we used to win competitions each year which is held by Hong Kong's leading universities.
* I also tried one of the past paper of UKMT Intermediate Maths Challenge for year 11 or below (""10th grade"" or below) and I got Gold award  in year 9 (8th grade).
* ""Straight A"" (but that might not be a sign of giftedness in particular) and usually get around 90-100% in assignments of subjects I care but sometimes could get as low as 75% for subjects that I don't really like as much.
* I picked a language rather fast: I managed to be better than my class who have been studying Spanish for 2 years more than I do and picked up BSL to a beginner level in one day, learned finger spell in 15 minutes.
* I enjoy debating on philosophical topics
* I can sometimes answer questions in science subjects or maths where no one could answer (by answer I meant type in the chat as I am online homeschooled)
* I like abstract ideas more than concrete ideas
* I remember being able to answer school question that was for my older brother (4 years older than me) when I was 5 
* I enjoyed learning science at a young age 
* I was always the one people find for academic help or for homework. 
* 50% of my lesson time in school ends up being me waiting for the class.

Against:

* I failed my maths exam twice (once in year 9 for all silly mistakes and once in year 1)
* I only started to learn some linear algebra and calculus in year 9 (8th grade) on my own during my spare time
* I was not as gifted as other story told in this sub by other parents:
* I struggled to memorise all 26 alphabet when I was younger
* I do not understand knowledge as fast or as easy comparing to how I was few years ago (but that might also be the increased difficulty?)
* My family would often consider me as dumb or ""r3tard""
* My Mensa IQ test score (75 or 76th percentile)
* I got 125 only in Mensa's Norway online test when I was 14 (for 16-17 years old, that was the youngest option)
* I think I am not as knowledgeable comparing to other gifted individual my age
* I am only ahead of my class for serval subjects but not all
* My knowledge can varies a lot in even one subject:for instance, I know some uni level physics but I do not know some of the GCSE physics content (a national exam in England and Wales for year 11 or ""10th grade"")
* I tend to give up on stuff quite easily when I was younger
* Unable to understand certain use of language, like sarcasm
* Sometimes could get as low as 75% in assignments for subjects that I don't really like as much.

Side note: Also now that I am 2 years ahead in Music, what could I do with that?

"Turning things into ""puzzles"" Not sure if this is related to giftedness or just a weird thing I do!

I love finding connections and linking things together. The whole ""correlation doesn't always equal causation"" things drives me nuts. It's just so crazy for me to think/know that so many factors can influence something, but we can't always 100% know why, or that it can be a combo of things or events.

For example, I have this weird thing of analyzing people. Maybe it's just the work I do (supporting kids with special needs/behavior concerns and developing strategies to meet goals) but I find people are fascinating! I take tidbits of conversations with people and kind of make a mental map of maybe why the way they are, have a certain outlook, or anticipate how they will react. I also see a lot of good in people, like maybe the things people get irritated or annoyed with are a result of ""x"" causing ""y"" in my brain if that makes sense. I wouldn't say I'm totally naive either.

In general, I'm very social, and I think I'm super easy to get along with. I love chatting with people and getting to know them! I also just love learning about cultures, history, and other people in general. 

Is this a gifted, work related, or a ""I've been through some shit"" kinda thing? Or am I just weird??  Tell me I'm not alone!",0
"Why can I never display my emotions properly? This post is more to vent, but dang I always have troubles with displaying my emotions properly. I do constantly get told by people that I don't seem thankful, that I often seem angry or sad, that relationships with me feel one sided, etc... and it is just starting to become too much. I tend to look at most things logically, so to me, it is enough to for example give someone a big hug and say thank you (because you know, these two actions get the label ""thankful"" in my head. If you are thankful, you hug someone and thank them). But there is always something that's actually missing and that makes people think I am not thankful, or whatever emotion we are talking about at that moment. There are also instances where according to my standards (and standards of the people who are closest to me), I do display an emotion properly but the other person has much different standards and is so sure that their is the universal one. I just find it so difficult to adapt to people sometimes. Obviously you should not adapt to others in exactly every way (one should also keep their own standards), but then the people will start pointing out the stuff you do differently and it ruins so many things (had many experiences like that, even got kicked from a friend group because of this). I find it really hard to judge whether it's me who's correct or the other person unless I also ask others about it, since I can see everything from varying perspectives.

What's even worse is that on the inside I am very emotional and even the smallest thing can make me feel intense emotions. I do generally feel guilt for so many things and I often am empathetic, but since I can't display it in a proper way, it goes to waste so often. According to people, it just rarely is enough. Well and people not thinking it is enough only makes me more emotional inside. What's more though, is that I rarely can even label the emotions I feel. Someone may ask me how I felt at a certain moment, and I will be able to recall the emotion almost exactly but I won't be able to name it at all (it also happens that I never pay attention to what I feel in the first place).

I am now getting professional help with all of this but the process feels so slow and it feels that so many relationships of mine are just getting ruined (in some cases I even feel that it's getting worse and worse). I just wish I could express myself in a way so others would be able to understand me.",0

"I finally understand... Hello all,

I rarely post anything on reddit, but this time I want to share my experience with you all, as yesterday was probably the most important day of my life. I'm going through tough personal experiences (breakup, father health problems...), but it pushed me to realize something very important. (TLDR at the end).

**""Gifted"" Background**: In ***2020*** I stumbled upon an article about gifted individuals (in France we call them ""HPI"" which stands for ""Haut Potential Intellectuel""), and related quite a bit while reading about the common traits gifted people have. I talked about it with my girlfriend and my family and they agreed I was onto something and said I should go see a specialist and get tested, which I did in ***2021***. Took the WAIS IV and scored 127. My score is very heterogeneous, with a strong dominance on the verbal part and the visualising and understanding of complex concepts. 

**About me**: I (27M) come from France. I'm a tax lawyer and currently work in tax advisory firm in Luxembourg. I have the most amazing and caring family and girlfriend, and the most amazing friends I could possibly dream of. Yesterday, I realized I'm slowly losing it all because I refuse to see and act on my complexity.

I always knew something was ""wrong"" with me, and often tell my parents that ""I don't function properly"" without really knowing why. Here are some of the characteristics of my personnality (i'll only cover the most problematic ones):

\- I'm a very ""intense"" person: everything I do or feel is x10. I act and talk impulsively. People often see me as **overwhelming**.

\- I have extreme emotional overexcitability: intense feelings, strong empathy, strong emotional attachments. I **overreact** a lot (e.g. catastrophization and overthinking).

\- I'm constantly thinking, thinking about thinking. I love theory, and take great pleasure in debating and explaining my ideas. I know I can easily see and systemize complex problems. The problem is I overintellectualise everything, always. I’m intellectually independant and have struggle respecting others opinions. I'm a **complete bully** without even realizing it when it comes to debating with others. People see my as a ""know-it-all"". It sucks...

\- I have high expectancies towards myself. I'm perfectionistic, self-critical, and dwell a lot about how I act and how I can get better at how I live my life. This part is crucial because paradoxically I don't realize how my complexity affects others around me, weird huh? This makes me seem as **critical and intolerant toward others**.

I absolutely need to face those negative sides about myself and to learn how to mitigate them. 

**What I finally understood yesterday:** After getting the results and the confirmation that I am somewhat gifted, I wasn't bothered and just went on with my life : that was a **mistake**. I did not understand (or refused to see?) that being gifted is hard and it takes time and effort to mitigate the negative sides.

Until now, I've always thought a lot about how people seem me and what they think of me. That's why I studied law, passed the bar, went to work for a lot of money away from my home, from my friends. That's what successful people do right? For someone who's supposed to be ""smarter"", I'm baffled at how evidently mistaken I was.

Until now, I've lived my whole life thinking about what I need to do to be successful rather than what I want to build my own success. **Yesterday, it hit me like a truck:** I won't be happy in life thinking my success comes from making big bucks in big law. Maybe I'll keep doing that, who knows? But whats most important now for me is to realise that my real challenge lies in taming my complexity, to shape my giftedness in the most beautiful way possible. I need to learn how to appreciate what I have, rather than pursuing happiness like its not already there. I need to do it for me, but also for the amazing people I have around me. I deserve to experience, and to give back more of the good sides of being who I am rather than the bad ones.

I feel like I've learned more about myself in a week than in 27 years. Its scary, but it feels good.

Thanks for listening. Have a great day.

&#x200B;

TLDR: After having lived the first 27 years of my life thinking I need to impress people and to live up to my capacities to feel successful, I've come to realize that my personal success will derive from accepting who I am, working on myself, and doing what I want rather than what I feel like I need.

"I regret it If I could go back, I would never have joined the fucking gifted program.

"Do you have VSS? For those unaware of Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS):

> Visual snow (VS) is a form of visual hallucination that is characterized by the perception of small, bilateral, simultaneous, diffuse, mobile, asynchronous dots usually throughout the entire visual field, but it can be partial, and it is present in all conditions of illumination, even with the eyes closed.

https://eyewiki.aao.org/Visual_Snow#Disease_Entity

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow_syndrome

I am wondering how VSS is correlated to general neurodivergence and if it can exist without ASD, ADHD, OCD, etc. 

The only three people I know who have VSS life-long, including myself, score in the gifted range on IQ tests. Yet, we would be 2E with all of our ailments and problems. 

This is a really big stretch but— perhaps the presence of life-long VSS may be an indication of an undiscovered ND disorder that may be positively correlated to enhanced cognition due to increased connections and hyperactivity of neurons in the brain. The bridge between ASD/ADHD and giftedness? I am aware that correlation does not equal causation.

My friends and I with VSS since childhood were able to speak very early as a sign of giftedness, yet we would score slightly above the threshold on the RAADS-R, for example. I wish someone would do a proper study on this and life-long VSS.

"Academic burnout. I'm a MSc student and I am heavily involved in local research on machine learning and mathematical optimization. I experience burnout-like state which suspectedly originates from the fact that I frequently overshoot the amount of knowledge and skills needed in most disciplines I am being taught just by using prior residual knowledge from self-learning, and now nearly every lecture I attend feels boring, lectures are paying no attention to my attempts to really prepare to exams instead of relying on skill of outsmarting examiners (I am really skilled at this), negative response on my tryouts to engage in educational process (usually I am being told ""I know that you know the right answer, let others work""). And because of this I really started to become lax in my learning duties, lax enough to feel the negative impact on adsorption of provided knowledge but not enough to push my grades below A+.

"Hyper brain and visualizing Hey!   
Why is my brain so hyper-active all the time? This is something i've struggled with my whole life.  
For me it seems like a lot of people can just go into  ''airplane mode'' and relax whenever they want, this is not the case for me. I constantly have thoughts that are building upon other thoughts and suddenly i start to wonder and get curious about things i really have no reason to be curious about. -  I get comments from other people. ''No normal person just thinks about that for no reason'' / ''You think about things no others think about'' and so on. I am not trying to say i am in anyway sharper or a better thinker then other people (the hell would i know, i don't see myself as that bright anyway), but i start to wonder why i am wired this way and other people are not?

I am not saying that other people do not have thoughts flying around in their head, ofcourse they do, we all do. But in my case it seems like it is going in high speed all the time. In combination to go a high speed, i aslo visualize a lot, and that in great details. The combination of rapid thoughts and visulizing can be a lot sometimes, this also makes it hard for me to fall asleep.  - And for some reason, this makes me talk extremely fast, to the point some people have a hard time understanding me. And no, i am not nervous or anxious when i speak to unknown people, but the combinations of fast thought and visulizing makes me gain informations very fast it seems like. Since i've been young this have been a problem, especially with teachers. ''You talk very fast, something it sounds like you are swallowing your words''. 

For instance, when i talk to people and they for example say ''apple'' or ''banana'' i get a lot of rapid thoughts and clear detailed pictures of where i've heard, seen or smelt that before. Like constantly flashes in my head or scenarios. - And the pictures can just build upon each other, for example the apple part. A friend saya the word apple, and i get a picture in my head of applepie, then i would probally get a picture of american pie in and would somehow connect that with an embarrassing sex-action my friend had some years ago, and that within seconds. - We would probally have a good laugh, but still look at me a bit goofy of why i suddently started to think about that, and then i will explain my thoughtprocess, and he would still look at me a bit goofed out.

This is also a reason i have minor anxiety, i have anxiety for things i can not controll. Therefore i double check things. - Reason being, i can clearly remeber i did task A in clear details in my head, but then i can visulize that i did not do task A in same cleared details i remeber i did task A. So it is a constant battle with my own imagination, but in the lates years i've started to just trust my gut and think about it from a more logical perspective. - If that made sense.   


Is this normal, or why am i wired like this? - Seems like mom are somehow in the same terms as me, but her anxiety is much worse then mine and stems from the same reason as mine, and she does not talk as fast tho, but still at a good pace.",0

"Cresconova-Online Gifted Programming Hello gifted community!

I have worked with gifted learners for many years both nationally and internationally, recently working at The Nueva School (a Nationally acclaimed school for gifted learners) for 4 years.

i WFH and am enrolled in many self-paced virtual courses. im having trouble caring about work because all i want to do is study, which makes work take longer, which leaves me no time to study. it's a stupid cycle.

any advice from people who worked and went to school at the same time? or just anyone who WFH in general?

thanks!",0
"How to find school interesting Hi, I'm a gifted 14 years old boy with some issues finding interesting school stuff. I literally don't study nothing and I always take bad grades.

"DAE get tired of constant pathologization? Is almost everything about gifted people some kind of disorder? Maybe it's because I'm older and had to fight this for many years, but I get tired of everything about being gifted -aside from the grades we stereotypically produce- being some kind of problem. Admittedly, I do it to myself sometimes, too. 

This isn't to say some gifted people don't legit have comorbids, but I think in general everything about gifted people gets pathologized. 

Lots of energy? Must be adhd. 

Stubborn? Opinionated? That's a problem, too. 

Passionate about something? Ocd or bipolar. 

Believe in your abilities? Narcissism and/or arrogance. 

Many different interests? That means you have no real personality and need a therapist. 

Not a robot who does and lives how pther people tell you to? You are defiant and may have odd. 

Prefer to focus on things one finds interesting? That's also a problem. 

Like, ok??? What's the point of being gifted if one does not believe in their abilities? Stubborn is good in many cases. If you're a scientist trying to cure cancer, you need to be stubborn. 

I'm my 35 years, I've never felt my giftedness was liked aside from producing grades and degrees. If I were not performing ""parlor tricks"" people act like my traits are very annoying.",0
"How do you find your purpose/hobbies ? (I’m a serial quitter) Hi,

How do you find your purpose, YOUR thing? My brother who is also gifted found his purpose in music. He spends all day learning, composing, writing music and he now lives from it.

However, I don’t have such a hobbie for myself. I don’t know what I really like or love. I have a degree in computer science, but I don’t really like programming, I only do it for the logical challenge (I’m starting to really lose interest for it after years).

Are there exercices, things I can do to help myself find it?

"ADHD + high IQ Vs. gifted? Little bit of context: I myself have been misdiagnosed with dyslexia as a child. After two years of treatment, they retracted the diagnosis because I was certainly not dyslexic. It's clearly I have *something*, but for some reason they didn't procede further into finding out *what*. I and most people around me are pretty sure it's some form of AD(H)D or something similar.

A couple of years ago, my sibling's partner was double diagnosed, along with giftedness. Just like me (and later i found out, just like my sibling), it was obvious to them their whole live they were different, but they weren't diagnosed during childhood. Now their child is showing signs of being gifted themselves (to young for official testing), so me and a few others in the family have been reading books about giftedness in children and adults alike to prepare on how to handle it.

My sibling and I recognise a lot of aspects of giftedness in ourselves. We've been talking about it, and my sibling is sure we both are gifted (my sibling's partner is pretty sure of my sibling as well, they don't know me enough to be as certain about me, but still think it's a high possibility). One thing is certain though: I display a lot more aspects of concentration difficulties and hyperactiveness than my sibling, and my sibling scored a bit higher on an IQ-test performed when we were young (them low 14O, me middle to high 130). While it's pretty obvious my sibling has undiagnosed giftedness, I myself am not sure if I'm gifted or if I have ADHD with a higher IQ. I know having an IQ in the middle to high 130 range doesn't *necessarily* meen being gifted. But knowing both people with ADHD and gifted people are neurodivergent I was wondering, is there actually a major diffference between having ADHD and a higher IQ, and being gifted?",0
"2e confusion/ looking for support hi yall :)

im gifted and within the past year or two have realized im also autistic. potentially ADD. im confused because so many of the traits overlap and i want to fit everything neatly into one diagnosis or another and it's just not working.

for example- having trouble getting work done because im bored. ADD or gifted?

saying inappropriate things due to over-intensity. gifted or ASD?

at the end of the day all of these labels are just an attempt at explaining the human experience based on shared qualities. so im trying to accept that it's a flawed system to begin with, that serves its purposes...but that categorization may not solve the answers to my soul searching.

anyone relate? advice? etc

"Gifted and ADHD FSIQ So can anyone with experience about this tell me since I can’t find a definitive answer from resources online?

If one has ADHD and is Gifted, areas of their  FSIQ are lower than they should be if they are unmedicated. Correct?

Is there a certain range that is specific to ADHD and Giftedness that is relatively the same no matter what one’s true range for their FSIQ would be if they are medicated? Or is it in relation to the person’s true range of abilities? So someone who is profoundly gifted with ADHD would have an above average or even gifted range FSIQ if they were to be evaluated without medication compared to someone who is moderately Gifted and ADHD?",0
"Im curious how you guys think i wonder how gifted people think i tend to think multidimensional visionair in movies, pictures and animations. I can also see sort of hawks eye view on world issues and patterns connecting the dots out of nowhere unconsciously. 

i can camera pan around objects in my head or through buildings or places and memories i have been before. 

See things from different perspectives also from other people with their experiences and how that reflects on my version of the thought always scanning my environment and getting inspiration how things work top down thinking, sometimes with my own dialogue or if my brain is in a weird vibe narrators or voices from other people multi langual. Sometimes its like i have my own radio playing in the background in my head and cant stop it.

I can hop from many different perspectives and more processes are going on at the same time where i am unconscious of sometimes.

I find it really hard to express my vision into words and language is really limiting for me. 

Also its not extremely vivid like watching 8k tv in my head or something it depends sometimes vague and i need more experience or information.

Also i really want to make it as efficient possible and make it work in reality and i am very flexible doing so.

Its also annoying because some people don’t understand what i say sometimes language really doesn’t matter to me i tent to make grammar mistakes and I actually really dont care about other peoples grammar i pickup instantly on the value of the information. 

I notice that i try to make vision compact like i make some zip file which with the right people unfolds and they vibe on my thought waves. With some people its a huge struggle because they have a ton of question marks and question my competence while i thought out even more than they can ever imagine but dont feel like proving myself over and over and have to give everyone seminars and essays for hours.",0
"Need advise from gifted parents, my 3 y.o. has already mastered Piaget’s conservation tasks? My little was born a 24 week micropreemie so I wasn’t expecting them to be advanced developmentally, but it’s been obvious from the start that they’re bright. 

They were a super early talker with a vocabulary of single-words at 5 months (corrected age) and using sentences by 8 months (corrected age). I bought them lots of baby books they’d sit and stare at/pretend to “read” when they were 10-11 months old (at which point they already could identify all the letters in the alphabet but couldn’t actually sound out words). Soon they started pulling MY books off the shelves and tables to look at and “read.”

I have a lot of art books (ex. like a book of collected prints of Yayoi Kusama) they are particularly fond of and like to sit and “read” all the time. I realized they’re able to identify which paintings are by which artist off of the style alone (I’ve tested them using pictures I know they haven’t seen before and they can identify painters like Dali, Monet, Van Gogh, Gauguin, off of the style of the painting).

They just turned 3 this month and for fun I ran them through all of Piagets conservation tasks, they understood all of them as being the same. I did my best not to do anything that may prompt any particular response/neutral expressions/quiet environment, though obviously it’d be different having them actually tested in a formal environment I was just curious to see how they’d respond. 

All of this is to say, I feel so out of my league. They surprise me every day with what they know, say, do, and how they problem solve. I’m curious to hear all advise, especially from other parents of children who were showing similar signs at this age, what worked parenting-wise in helping their development. How can I keep up with them? What can I do to support their learning and keep their mind challenged on new things? Anything I should avoid doing?

Examples:

Thinking “What a fortuitous circumstance I’ve found myself in” rather than “I’m so lucky right now.”

"From Ashlee Vance biography of E.M. concerning profound giftedness Listened to this audiobook about 6 times all the way through in the past 2 months and keep coming back to these paragraphs (emphasis mine).   


""Musk's behavior matches up much more closely \[than Aspergers, discussed in prev paragraph\] with someone who is described by neuropsychologists as \*profoundly gifted\*. These are people who in childhood exhibit exceptional intellectual depth and max out IQ tests. It's not uncommon for these children to look out into the world and find flaws - glitches in the system - and \*construct logical paths in their minds to fix them\*. For Musk, the call to ensure that mankind is a multiplanetary species partly stems from a life richly influenced by science fiction and technology. Equally it's a moral imperative that dates back to his childhood. In some form this has forever been his mandate.

Each facet of Musk's life might be an attempt to soothe a type of \*existential depression\* that seems to gnaw at his every fiber. He seems man as self-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The people who suggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in the way of all of this and slowing Musk down. He does not dislike them as people. It's more that \*he feels pained by their mistakes\*, which have consigned man to peril that much longer. The perceived lack of emotion is a symptom of Musk sometimes feeling like he's the \*only one who really grasps the urgency of his mission\*. He's less sensitive and less tolerant than other people because the stakes are so high. Employees need to help solve the problems to the absolute best of their ability or they need to get out of the way....""

My first specific question - where do you meet gifted friends and partners in real life?

Also, I'm seeing some suggestions to have non-gifted friends who have specific interests. The problem I've had with this is simple boredom.

"Something I wish I had known when I was younger - focus on the basics I posted a question, and I realized I'm always asking for advice and rarely offering any that isn't ad-hoc in another post, so here's something that would have saved me about ten years.

I'm about to be 33 now. I spent a lot of my life exploring a multitude of academic topics because I wanted to ""know everything I could."" I still do, but I realized now there's so much I don't have mastered that's extremely pragmatic.

People have a tendency to overestimate their ability in endeavors they partake in regularly. This is where all the benefit is. Instead of focusing on mathematics, music, programming, foreign languages, and all the other things that make you academically well-rounded (that aren't hobbies or career-related), focus on those most basic things - the science of happiness, mood management, your own psychology, the science of relationships, communication skills, etc.

Not only is this more useful, it's more rewarding by extension. You feel better when you use something to overcome a problem, and it's much easier to stay motivated.

Big caveat, don't just read about these things generally. Choose good sources. There's a lot of pseudoscience on these topics. Don't just google ""How to be happy;"" read the papers from the Harvard Study on Adult Development.

Oh, and take a slow, concentrated process toward learning these things. I know we have trouble being patient, but if you can't focus over an extended period of time, work on that first. I had untreated ADHD until I was 30, I think. I was in first gear most of my life and didn't know it.",0

"Giftedness and nicotine/cannabis Hope this is the right forum, I am not praising/recommending drugs/drugabuse!

[m24] So hi,

I‘m having a problem with said drugs when entertaining myself. 

To get to the point quickly: 
I feel like I got to a point in life where I cannot entertain myself other than making my head „numb“ to any sensation and reducing my need for difficult recreational activities to the bare minimum, for example watching shows, playing simple games or reading a „not too great“ book.

I am not sure if this is related to me being gifted, but as giftedness and drug consumption are significantly  correlated (James White, david Batty), I hope to find individuals who experience(d) the same fate and like to share advise or ask questions.



I smoked tobacco for around 3/4 years, then stopped last year only to fall into cannabis addiction right after. 
I havent been to addiction counseling yet, but will go this week as I want to get to work with my easily addicted self. 
I still have a pretty busy schedule, which also results in higher consumption to „get down“ in the evenings.

Thank you for your advise:)",0

"Task motivation Hi, like most gifted people (from what I read), I get interested in different topics with frequency, mainly as soon as I finish understanding the basis of my current interest topic. My problem is keeping the motivation to complete the current task/tasks when my mind is already thinking about the next steps (currently in a critical way, as I need to finish polishing an algorithm and writing my Ph.D. thesis, but all I can think of is the next ideas I have for new applications of what I learned and other possible ideas for different fields of interest, and by so I can't finish what I NEED TO DO right now).

"I'm feeling like I'm not living up to my potential I'm a 17 year old guy in highschool who has been identified gifted by literally every teacher (well only anedcotically, I never took an IQ test but still). 

The expectations that were put onto me were extremely high, I started reading very early (like 3-4 years) and at a very young age i had lots of interests (that of course, somewhat distinguished me from my peers) like reading astronomy, cars, cartoons, brick building etc. In Kindergarten I was also talking about pretty ""advanced"" stuff and i was doing 2-3 grade math when I was 5. My giftedness was pretty much apparent when I started going to school. The first 8 grades were pretty easy, i got good exams scores and could go to the best highschool in my city. 

This is basically were my problems started to ramp up. You see, I never actually developed any study methods because I didn't need to study. But now, in my highschool the shiton of work demands a perfect work ethic from me. The first year was a tragedy for me and I ended with an above average GPA, but not really an ideal one. 

Although my habits are improving, I still think it's not enough, especially considering what a legacy i have to uphold. My mum was always an incredibly gifted student, she scored the 1st place on the math national exam and 2nd in physics. She was also the best in her medical school. She also has wrote few advanced philophical works, but he didn't finish her phd. This places an extremely high pressure on me to succeed at basically everything.

"Narcissism and giftedness Unfortunately there is a big misconception between narcissism and giftedness. And many narcissists mistake themselves for being gifted and HSP. 

Most narcissistic people have a form of covert narcissism and empathic narcissism in combination with feeling very sensitive for themselves and because they create all these frameworks to use in day to day life can live therefor in a delusion it can make them think they are highly intelligent or gifted or different. This can also show in body dysphoria and personality issues.

They might feel strong empathy for others and have strong moral compass and show controlled compassion and think in ways to push this forward in every way possible might suffer from OCD kind of symptoms and dysphoria and therefor feel miss fits and have a hard time with adapting in society. 

They can even have depression and anxiety. Being busy with topics to feed their frameworks but is most of the time very subjective and biased. Because they use all this info to get something out of it for themselves they can be pretty educated on some topics but will show manipulation and aggressive behaviour in return when their bubble bursts. 

What is seen pretty often is that these narcissists find groups to feed each other and find compassion. most of the time it also drags real empathic people that wants to help them and other narcissists who support them.

There are “gifted” narcissists who might say that giftedness is something spiritual and connected to higher dimension’s, they also go in discussions a lot to prove themselves how smart they are and unique. And react with a lot of information in perfect grammar and punctuation that actually doesn’t say much to prove their point. 

They talk a lot in labels and self diagnoses and rare disorders, will fact check on everything and ask for scientific proof even if there might not be a study for it, while its just commons sense.

For sure there might be gifted people with narcissism but the opposite is more common.",0

Would you have stopped propping yourself off to unobtainable standards? Would you have/ have not taken the program that your school district provided for you? Would you have tried to learn college studying habits instead of being lazy?

I'm interested to hear your stories. I think that they will provide me significant insight about what makes you tick and it can help me avoid some of the pitfalls you fell into.

"What should we do for our top 0.1% kid? We have four kids. Our first two go to a local private school for the gifted. The school requires a standardized test for the 4.5 year old pre-kindergarten applicants (which is already a little ridiculous). Our first two scored pretty high (top 2% then top 1%). 

Our third just did the test this week. He took it younger than the other two (based on where his birthday falls in the year) but just destroyed the other two on his score. Doctor said he got to the hardest question on most of the categories and got the hardest questions right (which he said he has never seen in his professional life). I asked if it was luck - these are multiple choice after all, but he said he asked for his reasoning and it was correct. 

Anyway, his absolute scores were much higher than the other two and his age was younger. Result was “top 99.9-percentile” (and they don’t measure beyond that). 

(Maybe related? - he is also ridiculously physically gifted. He stared walking at 8 months - way earlier than his siblings. He can throw and catch and play frisbee like an adult (again - very unlike his older siblings) and he is so skilled on his scooter these days that we are often stopped by strangers who are shocked by how old he is. I have lost count of the number of strangers who approach me and ask me if he is going to play football.)

Default plan is for him to go to the same school as his sisters. There is a local lacross league that starts at the kindergarten level that I may try to get him into a year early. He is getting extra stimulation from his early sisters so he can do basic multiplication and division now. And he loves playing chess so we do that most days (he does not seem to be a genius here at all that I can tell. But he at least knows how to play the game and very basic strategy). 

Is there anything specific we should be doing or thinking about?

I know there are things like Center for talented youth at John Hopkins. But that seems to be for anyone in the top 2% and doesn’t start until 2nd grade. Anything we should be doing when he is still pre-K or over the next few years?

I don’t wanna go on a tangent about my story and whole life’s journey up to now because I know I’ll get off track, perhaps on a later post.

"giftedness and autism relation? one neuropsychologist said all my autistic symptoms are actually due to giftedness while a bunch of other professionals said i was autistic (but the one that said it was giftedness was the only one to apply the gold standard test for autism). that made me really confused, i don't know which one i am, or even both. it feels like something's not quite right.

before seeking a formal diagnosis i was pretty confident i had autism and ADHD (with high IQ that didn't really affected anything - tests were made by professionals).

is this confusion between these conditions common? what about you guys? are you also autistic/adhd or just gifted? 

how are the symptoms of giftedness  nearly exactly the same as the symptoms of autism, and similar to ADHD too?

i need tips to figure things out because i've been on this quest for a diagnosis for months and it's really frustrating",0
"Does anyone have a really solid way of describing how unrealistic their expectations for themselves got? I suspect I have a tendency to set my goals way too high, and I don't think I even know what's realistic for me anymore. Worse, it occurred to me earlier that people do in fact lie on the internet, and I might often be influenced to pick up the pace by fabricated stories. For instance, I saw a post earlier where a guy claimed to be making $320,000 at age 28. Now, this particular claim could be true, but about 5% of people supposedly have a pathological or compulsive lying problem. Most of the time I see these crazy claims, they probably aren't true. (That's just Bayes' Theorem in action.) Unfortunately, my brain doesn't think, ""Wait, only 1% of Americans of any age make that income."" Instead, my brain defaults to, ""I could be doing so much better. I really need to try harder."" I've also forgotten that I don't account for the conditions of my upbringing. I was born into poverty, and I often forget that about half of Americans grew up in households where their parents made $70,000 or more. I don't think about having had unmedicated ADHD until I was 30, and because most people I know are neurodivergent, I forget most people don't lack executive function in the same way. Despite all of this, I still expect myself to accomplish not only anything meaningful to others, but eventually I expect myself to be good at almost everything society deems meaningful that's even remotely within my grasp. Intellectually, I know this is impossible, but I'm not really getting *how* out of touch my standards are, so I'm wondering if anyone has a really meaningful anecdote of, ""I knew I was being unrealistic with myself when..."".",0
"underachiever, 2e, coping strategies Dear all, 

I am moderately gifted and suffer very severe mental issues. Due to them and some bad luck (also a lot of stigmatization because of my issues) I am one of the worst underachievers that I have ever heard about. Although I have to admit that sometimes there are short times in which I excel, so my performance is fluctuating a lot. 

Right now I am in a position where I have to do much stuff that I have learned some years ago in the past already and I am dying out of boredom. I restarted college and since some courses are somewhat differently in their topics or in their partitioning of the content I can't simply take the credit for the old ones in this program. 

I have no real strategies to cope with underchallenge. In school I didn't do anything and got through. My health improved once I got out of school (so I had no real strategy back then too). When I learn a lot I feel better, but right now there is no chance to learn (much) new stuff and I feel as if I was back in school, this nagging boredom is getting and eating me. I think it stresses me out on a different level. Sometimes I need a day or longer to recover from being bored out in a lesson. it ruins this very exciting subject for me somehow. Also, I struggle with my misconception that I have a really strong tendency to adapt to other people's expectations. It makes me depressive. But without this program I barely have any chance for a good job later. Idk what to do. Sorry for being whiny. 

Does anyone know any groups for gifted underachievers, 2es, knows strategies to cope with that (I am really grateful for anything since I am very dissociative and traumatized I think I just become numb and dissociate once I am in such an dissatisfying situation and have troubles getting out - this is what I have done mainly in school etc)?",0
"Biased teachers professors and studies Over the years i start to see a pattern in many different studies what was not happening before it’s like it all comes down to political manipulation or some “cultist” biases. Also people very much refer to these studies because it is science and “proven” meanwhile its wrong even peer studies which have connections with the other studie performers etc. 

Also scientists professors and teachers very much go on this bandwagon, i am glad there recently is a site where you can report biased professionals. 

What is very concerning is the misinformation that gets indoctrinated in our society if you can’t trust science and teachers than what can you trust? 

A university should be a place where you can discuss everything without a biased outcome. Meanwhile universities these days lean way much more toward one political opinion. 

another thing is people these days get labeled as professor meanwhile i dont think their title is worthy even if they did a lot of studies, what did they do in the main-time, eating out of their nose? And their behaviour is outrageous almost lunacy. 


Next to that media also plays a big role the framing and manipulation is absolutely disgusting. And the amount of misinformation even on reddit and twitter is absolute insanity.

Any ideas how we could fix this?",0
Disdain for the less intelligent The disdain some here have for those they regard as 'average' or 'not very intelligent' disturbs me. It runs counter to my own beliefs re the use of intelligence.

It's not  bemoaning the fact you can arrive at a solution in 20 minutes while it can take others 10 hours.,0
"Constantly Feeling the Need for “Newness” I haven’t thought about being gifted for a while but I’m 25 and I feel like my life has come to a bit of a standstill. In the past five years I finished my engineering degree and moved around between different countries for exchange studies and work. I’d feel this pull between being somewhere new and going back home to live a more “conventional” life. Whenever I was abroad it felt like there were more possibilities to meet interesting people and experience new places where things could be better for me. But at the same time I felt I was lacking in developing long term relationships and a sense of permanence and belonging.

I’ve been back in my home city for four months and I feel unsettled, like it’s hard for me to do the things normal people do, even staying in my current job for longer than a year feels like a big commitment. Life feels mundane, depressing and I’m not sure how to combat this desire for stimulation and newness. Has anyone faced something similar?",0
"Having to convince people I don’t know if you guys also struggle with this problem. If i have to explain my ideas, goals or my dreams to someone they instantly drag it into the Abyss because they themselves would struggle with that and react very anxious to my ideas. “But if you want to do this than you need that and you need to this and that you probably didn’t think it through”. 

Everything you just said i go through in different layers multiple times per day dont worry and its not really an issue… 

on one hand you can think these people just try to go on the wave i have been going on for years plus they themselves would probably struggle with it a lot and project it on me. 

But on the other the reaction i get is it makes me insecure at first but when so many people do this you almost start to adjust and believe it and just scratch my plans.  

Plus when you also go into discussion with these people it ruins the harmony and i just shut up because than it becomes some sort of ego game. 

But at the same time than they take the whole time to prove themselves why its not working for them and they are glad they dont do it. 

Nice thats how 99% of the people never really achieve something huge and stay in their comfort zone thats why it are my goals and dreams.

Also need to mention my goals and dreams are not crazy outlandish or anything.

Worst case scenario is that it triggers me and i give them a whole seminar which they cannot follow and they will pull it down the drain and become stubborn.

"Music stimulating for neurodivergent people (8D Sound/ bilateral sound/ mash ups)? So, scrolling through some reels, I discovered this trend with music that is supposedly stimulating for neurodivergent people (the captions will often say something about ADHD or Autism, but sometimes they just say neurodivergent in general).

The tracks used usually belong to the categories of ""8D/spatial sound"", ""bilateral stimulation"" or are simply layered mash ups.

However, when searching for similar music, I'm kinda lost. 8D sounds are the easiest to find, but most of them are remixes of pop songs with much worse vocals, which isn't really my kind of music.

Searchich for bilateral stimulation, I mostly find meditative tracks, but I'd like something more upbeat.

Regarding mash ups, I'm sure there's a ton of good one's out there, but I don't really know where to start.

So I thought I'd ask here. What music do you find stimulating? Any ideas on where to search for similar tracks? Feel free to share your thoughts :)

"When others withhold praise or exclude you People often assume being gifted comes with confidence, but that has not been my experience. More often, I feel alienated, unappreciated, and excluded without knowing why. One problem I have is with peers and classmates. I realize this sounds trivial, but it has also been a pattern that has caused significant frustration for years, which is why I'm sharing it here.

I'm a college student, but for as long as I can remember, I've received less praise and recognition for my work and far fewer compliments in general than my peers, even when I've devoted significant time and energy to my work.

For example, classmates share their thoughts in class, and everyone else nods, saying, ""Great point,"" or, ""Yes! I agree."" But that doesn't happen when I share. Peers sometimes refer to something I previously said but won't give me credit, or they stay silent after I share or give a presentation. I get an icy vibe, and it doesn't help that I notice *everything* in social interactions, including feelings others try to hide.

But I don't remember the last time someone complimented me or said, ""Great work."" I'm a 4.0 student and get positive remarks from my professors, but my peers treat me differently for reasons I don't get. I'm not arrogant, I don't brag, and I compliment others when I mean it, so I see no valid reason for their behavior.

I know I shouldn't care about compliments, but all human beings need encouragement now and then. There's nothing wrong with admitting that, as long as we aren't too dependent on it. But for me, it's about the principle of it, and I can't shake the feeling some people are withholding compliments on purpose. I can't prove it, but I wonder. Does anyone relate?

Thank you for listening.",0
"Who else is anti intellectual? I was typing a really long rant about how ""intelligence"" as a concept is pointless and misused and how I hate hearing people using the term ""intelligence""/""IQ"" to refer to things that it doesn't pertain, etc etc and I realized that I can't be bothered.

Whatever this thing called ""intelligence"" is, I want nothing to do with. I always known that I played dumb for convenience, I just never realize the extent to which I have been doing it. One of a byproduct of (at least my type of) intelligence is that I'm very good at reading the room and realizing where everyone else is at, and then learn to immediately pretend to be on exactly the same page with everyone else, whether they are right or wrong. That skill helps with amateur acting I found out, I just didn't realize how long I have been doing it.

I can think of so many things that can be described as intelligence, and none of them are related to each other, worse yet, no one even seems to even try to measure most of them.

The ""IQ"" people want to measure (IQ tests, SAT, GRE, MCAT, LSAT, etc.) is almost exclusively linear processing, and (almost) no thoughts been given to parallel processing (incidentally linear processing is almost useless in real life unless you're a computer programmer). No one seems to care about a measurement for anything more multidimensional e.g. sensory integration or even anything more straightforward (but more useful) e.g. short term tactile memory (I know it's under explored because I talked to a PhD program about that and those fuckers seem to think this idea, as straightforward as it is, is a good idea).

This gives rise to certain wishful narratives about the ""idiot savant"" or the ""autistic genius"", as though something has always have to give because ""you can't be smart and be normal"" or something, like a self fulfilling prophecy because people are hellbent in trying to paint the capacity of thought in the manner that only apply to linear processing, and people who are good at linear processing must then, for whatever reason, be bad at being human (being human is supposedly a byword for sensory and abstract integration in parallel processing, which, ironically, these humans couldn't find a word for).

Whatever my beef is with intelligence, it just makes me sick and tired and not want to be bothered with having a genuine conversation with anyone about anything. Simplified example, I want to go buy a fun sports car, people will start talking to me about horsepower. Am I gonna start asking them about the rev range where the power is? The ECU map? How much time can I actually spend in that power band? At sea level? Intake temp?

Or, rather, should I just patronize them and nod along? ""Intelligent"" is not a real thing (my believe, don't @ me), but if we were to use that term in a common vernacular sort of way (which is just about as accurate as the neuroscientists definition btw), it is no fun. I want to get a car and go vroom vroom, but if you ask, I'm gonna have all these questions in my mind, and I know none of these fuckers I'm talking to even thought about these questions unless they are into cars or engineering.

At any rate, just because I can think in nuance, who tf told anyone that I enjoy thinking and having conversations in nuance? People don't get things like torque curve or fuel mix or scrub radius or whatever (again, simplified analogy, I know most people understand those), but I just told them that I want to go into a car and go skrrrt skrrrt, how tf are they not getting *that*? 

I have just grown to be very good at playing dumb, and tbh I'd rather be known as dumb, or be actually dumb, because I just can't be bothered to share my idea with other people, or worse yet, having to explain shit to people. Just because I can ask and answer questions doesn't mean I enjoy asking and answering. Bitch don't kill my vibe.

If anything, playing dumb is the only way to make people confront with concept that they don't agree with. How many of y'all had the experience when the person you are talking to just absolved themselves from having to think through the topic you are talking about by trying to patronize you in telling you that you are ""smart""?

I hate having to indulge in convos, especially one where people pretend (or they genuinely believe? god I hope not) that ""achievement"" is related to ""career"" is in term related to ""intelligence"". Because 1. I see exactly that they are alluding to a caste system and 2. I'm not buying into it, and even if I were to buy into it, I will have 982937 metrics and definitions I need to sort out with them. And I don't even want to talk to them.

And I hate ""logic"" convos even more. Everyone and their dog knows what classic logic is and know how to do deductions and inductions, it is not cool or fun or meaningful to ""logic"" people. There is no logic in trying to perform logic deduction or whatever they call it, when there is no actionable decisions to be made at the end of it. I seriously don't understand society's obsession with ""logic"", where is the logic in performing deductions and inductions when you are not making an active choice? And what is the point of rerunning the same deduction twice? You make a calculation and you do it once, and you leave it as is. Don't fuck with the numbers. Seriously, why people say that ""I need time to think about it""? They obviously mean that they need time to get accustomed to and feel comfortable with their decisions so they need to regurgitate their calculations 808435 times to pacify themselves. Which is totally fine and normal, so just say it out loud in honesty. The dishonesty via performing logical deductions in illogical circumstances really trigger me. And god forbid, the people who define being ""logical"" as their identity might as well define dishonesty (specialized in self dishonesty) as their identity. (God I fucking hate Ben Shapiro and I want him to logicalize with my right uppercut. That lightweight can't do nothing right and somehow people watch him).

I spent my entire life (in my early 30s) playing dumb because I rather be blending in, functioning, enjoying my time then to drag every convo into a tangent. Whenever I see life advice about being ""smart"", or even people who talk about being ""smart"", or even thirsty pop up ads that seems to think that I (or indeed anyone) is gagging for validation in the form of a simplistic, overarching, and over-fucking-whelmingly wrong and pointless metric such as ""IQ"".

I mean, for the love of god, fucking kill me now.",0
"Gifted as an adult and problems with mental help organisations in the Netherlands Hello, 

long story short. I recently accepted that i am gifted after being in denial for years. the whole label doesn’t matter to me and IQ score. I need help how to deal with it i am 28 years old and im stuck in life, my whole life feels like a lie to me after so many jobs and failing at school and going from burnout to bore out i just feel like my flame is burning out.

Last time i asked for mental help again and opened up about giftedness and asked for help how to deal with this i went in another devastating psychology experience where i got misunderstood and the psychiatrist and psychologist didn’t know anything about the subject. I decided to follow their advice and their protocols but it didn’t help they even called me arrogant and unrealistic and challenged me to not believe in it. They worked with a new method that they dont focus on labels which i can partly understand but in this case it sounds like being so openminded that their brain fel out.

Eventually at the end of the process the psychiatrist said there is nothing wrong with me and i should accept that life is hard and you need to find your own way… lol, what an advice..

I had a discussion with her and she compared it to transgenderism and there she lost me completely. 

Eventually i went back to the doctor and she planned a meeting with some psychology adviser. 

That meeting also didn’t went well i had to prove myself constantly in the conversation we had and gave me vague assumptions that it might be PDD NOS or HSP which i debunked.

Eventually it seemed to trigger him and started to behave like he was more intelligent and told him he should be authentic and i understand he should do his protocol but that i did years of research myself and i dont want to be better than anyone else and idc if i am gifted at al and just need help with my problems. 

Eventually he started to sense that i think completely different and actually has no idea if there is anything he could do for me.

This whole experience is eating me inside i feel like an alien that is stuck. Even feel that i might be delusional. And try to challenge my own thoughts till the whole name “giftedness” turns my stomach.

Im even thinking to try to solve it myself but i need someone to challenge my mind from an outside perspective.

Are there any people who experienced the same and has any advice or tips?

much appreciated",0

"""You're perfect"" No, I am not.

Yes, it is true I am smarter than most people in most areas of knowledge, both academic and street-wise. You're totally right when you say I get things a lot faster than ""normal"" people. In fact, I can read lots of things, like the room, an 1889 novel in a foreign language, those school books you paid for but never read, local and foreign newspapers and even body language!

We can talk for hours about football, in spite of the fact that I seldom find joy in watching a match. Or we could perhaps discuss the intricacies of alluring the opposite sex, between ""bros"". How about the dynamics of college parties where everyone gets wasted? And all those girls after me? They are cute, and I won't deny I find their attention entertaining, but they are, in my eyes, a waste of time to be with.

On a regular basis, people from all walks of life, degrees of education and familiarity tell me I am ""brilliant"", ""cool to be around"", ""off to a great life"", simply ""perfect"". And yet, I feel like my truth doesn't live up to everyone's expectations. I have a bad relationship with my family, most of my 'friends' are fake and completely untrustworthy and people ask but never give. There is no person I can truly trust with my true self. All I ever show the world is a mask consisting of delusions of grandeur, extroversion, passion for things I couldn't give a dime about, never making any mistakes and just being the ""perfect"" guy.

I feel like a farce. I may be surrounded by people all day long, but I bet I am the loneliest of them all. Don't worry though, I'll be fine, because that's how I've always been and how I'll always be.

All these things are just kids being taught to perform tricks for the sake of their parents' bragging rights. It does nothing to help the kids themselves.

"To put a 7yr old with older kids or not? My son is 7. So far we've been trying to keep him a little kid - stay with kids his age and not feel the pressure of the workload of older kids. Currently, we are fighting the school to accommodate his abilities and needs because he's growing unhappy. I'm really scared they'll want to put him with older kids.  

Can you please share your thoughts or stories? I kinda want him to be like Matilda and get to work on his own, but stay with kids his own age. I don't know what I really think is best. 

More details below

The school hasn't noticed he's PG due to physical limitations and he's growing unhappy with having to write and read too much, but at the same time the content is too easy. He's been able to do due more than his peers for years, but with the pandemic everything was virtual for years. He did one semester of first grade in person and we just wanted him to have fun with friends and get use to real school. That teacher did some work with him on the side, just because she was sweet and attentive, but she never realized how far she could have pushed him. This year's teacher just thinks he's keeping up because of the physical challenges. Tuesday we are taking our professionals to meet with the school. 

We are living in South America currently and in a small private school. There aren't gifted programs in any of the schools.

"Lightbulb moment - we, as parents, were getting it so wrong. 
I posted on Monday about my son’s (9) new diagnosis of dysgraphia & being gifted (98th percentile).  

Since then, our household has become the most calm I think it has been in years! 
Previously, everything was a battle.  It felt like he was pushing back or arguing for every single thing.  This led to frustration on our part and then the inevitable arguments, crying, shouting & upset.  A terrible cycle on repeat.  

Well, all week we’ve made a massive conscious effort to appeal to his intellect and rational side.  One simple example, every second evening it’s his turn to empty the dishwasher.  Normally a major trigger for arguments, but in the interest of fairness between him and our daughter (11), we always insist he does it.  This week I’ve been saying things like  “I need the dishwasher emptied.  I’m about to start preparing dinner and there are some utensils in there I need”.  Or “do you think it would be easier to get the job done before dinner, so it will be empty and we can put our dirty dishes in after we eat?”   I can see him pause, consider, then say “That makes sense, I’ll do it now”.   

I said to my son this morning how amazing it is that since we met the ed. psychologist on Monday there’s been no arguments or upset all week.  He said “But Mom, I haven’t changed at all, it’s because you and Dad now understand”.  I honestly don’t know whether to laugh or cry.  I feel so sad and angry that our eyes weren’t opened sooner.  That we could have been parenting him so much better if only we had realised.  

We had a chat.  I said I was so sorry that I had not been understanding him all this time.  He said to me “sometimes your door to understanding gets stuck Mom” and I just thought, WOW! How incredibly perceptive he is.  How emotionally intelligent! And how forgiving he is of us.  I honestly am just bursting with pride and love for him.",0
"My awareness paralyses me How do you live while being constantly aware of the meaninglessness of life? 

How can you perform any tasks at all if there’s no point in doing anything?

How can you put effort into anything that doesn’t give you immediate enjoyment?

How do you work to build a stable and happy future for you if all the work will inevitably end in death and absence?

How do you take yourself seriously when ‘you’ is nothing but a bag of organs and liquids that somehow ended up gaining a conscience and calling itself “I”? 

The conflict between my awareness and my ego is paralysing me, I am unable to live, love, study, develop friendships, etc. It’s two parts of me that just can’t coexist.

EDIT: this post has been heavily misinterpreted. I’m not depressed and I’m widely familiar with positive nihilism, existentialism, absurdism and so on. The point of my questions was to have a direct answer to them, I was really interested in knowing what you think of life and our place in the world, but this apparently came across as a request for help. Maybe it was the “conclusion” that made people believe I was spiralling into an abyss of mental illness, and that’s definitely on me for being unclear, but again all I wanted was to learn your ideas about the conflict between ego and totality, that characterises the human species because of its developed awareness. Maybe I asked these questions in a seemingly ‘desperate’ way because I was in a moment of crisis due to this problem. Anyway, that is why I didn’t reply to all the comments, but thank you for trying and sorry.",0

"Work ethic isn't that useful As much as a solid work ethic is sought after in this subreddit, it's not actually as useful as it's described to be. In fact, as someone who has had to rely on hard work, I find that kind of talk greatly upsetting. Perhaps you have not had to rely on work ethic, but that means you are not aware of how fortunate you have been. Work ethic without intelligence has ruined my life.

Let's put it this way: intelligence is like a car and work ethic is like walking. Based on the narratives I see on this subreddit, it doesn't matter if you get to the same place. If you walk to work, maybe it'll take more time and energy than if you drive, but you'll still end up at work. But what about the trip home? What about the walk the next day? What about groceries? And forget about any road trips across the country, there are certain goals that can't be achieved through work ethic alone. The fact is that life isn't about achieving one specific goal, it's about many, life itself is a big series of tasks and the process of accomplishing them, and so speed ends up mattering a lot more than position. And sure, you may develop a very good work ethic, analogous to strong legs. But even Usain Bolt cannot walk everywhere. He has no hope against the average car. And let me tell you as someone who has had to walk everywhere: hard work gets no easier for people who have to rely on it. I know it feels hard to you but you need to recognize that it is just as hard for us. We put in the effort often because we don't have the blessing of high aptitude, but don't mistake that for finding effort easy.

Maybe your problem is that driving takes a certain input of effort/walking too. You do need a baseline level of effort. After all, you need to walk to your car, which is tough if you never had to learn to walk. Even Einstein couldn't do anything if he slept all day. But this can be changed, you can develop a work ethic. No matter how hard I try or how much I want one, I can never get a car. We get a brain at birth and we are stuck with it. I won't comment on how easy developing a work ethic is (although almost the entire human population has done it), but it is certainly easier than ""impossible.""

I have had to watch people effortlessly accomplish what I couldn't in hundreds of hours of effort. I have sacrificed a lot just to keep up and have no hope of ever doing great things. All this just to see the people who don't share this struggle complain because of a glorified idea of hard work. It's not so easy. I have been largely useless and have accomplished very little, not because of a lack of drive or ambition or dedication, but because of a simple difference in aptitude. The ""lazy but smart"" people are miles past me despite having to expend no effort. It is so frustrating to see people on this subreddit act like giftedness is something bad.

And a lot of good ""earning my success"" has done me. I'm not sure you understand how little consolation the moral idea of having ""earned one's success"" is when you just can't accomplish anything. When you're at the end of a two hour walk to the grocery store just to get food and are now faced with the long walk home, you're not thinking about whether you ""earned"" the food you ended up with. What good is ""deserving your successes"" if you never experience them? As smart as you guys are, as easily as you understand things, you sure seem to have a lot of trouble understanding this.",0

"Good gifted kids program? (Hi, my school currently has no option for students who are academically understimulated.

"Neuropsych eval or just IQ test? Per the title, I'm trying to figure out which to get for my 7-year-old, if any. He's several grades ahead in math and reading, and is a happy boy, but is having behavioral issues at school, so I wonder if testing could give us some solid info, since the teacher is pretty fed up.

I've always thought neuropsych evals were for if your child was presenting components of ADHD, etc. but we're fairly certain he does not have ADHD (the school doesn't think he does either), though he might.

"I don't think I'm gifted However I'm interested in finding out more about it. I'm a 65 year old non college/uni educated male.   My academic record was mediocre. I have a long history of severe mental illness and I'm a late dxed autistic person. Though not officially diagnosed it's probable that I have the following - severe social anxiety(seen as part of the SMI), dyspraxia(mentioned by several mental  health pros but not  officially assessed),dysgraphia, and last of all total aphantasia.   


I have done fairly well at high range IQ tests i.e verbal approx 71% questions right, numerical 52% and spatial 30%. Like many,but not all, with ASD, adaptive functioning < intelligence level very much applies. I don't score high when it comes to common sense and practical skills.

Trying to please my parents re going to university, I'd have been the first from my family to do so,while being acutely aware that I didn't have the necessary non academic skills to manage with it  caused intense anxiety.

"The College Admissions Process Does Not Work for Gifted People I've been a lurker on this sub for some time, and made a throwaway account to make this post. As for my background, I am a gifted 10th grader (IQ 135-140) who currently goes to a gifted grades 6-12 school.

I will start by outlining the issues with some deeper issues with our education system.

**TL;DR** Is it better to be the miserable big fish in a small pond, or the big fish with other big fish who can never find enough food to eat?

&#x200B;

**Grading is a silly idea**

I do not understand the school system's obsession with getting good grades. Even though in a career it is more important to be good at a few things rather than decent at everything, the school system rewards the latter. To be a ""good student"" one must get straight As in every class, which encourages breadth rather than depth of learning. Someone who dedicates all of their time to math is more likely to discover something great than someone who spends 2 hours a day doing math, 2 hours doing reading, etc. Even in college where you are allowed to focus in more on a specific topic, the first two years are taken up by general education, which is not all that different from middle and high school.

&#x200B;

**Tests that are required for admission are stupid**

AP tests tend to reward memorization and speed, and some to a degree where getting a good score is not about your mastery of the subject, but how much you study. For example, AP Literature requires students to write three essays in two hours, giving a student and average of 40 minutes per essay. Being able to write an essay in 40 minutes is not a useful school in college, nor in real life, which makes getting a good score on that exam more about how much a student practiced writing essays quickly rather than a test of the student's ability to comprehend literature. 

It seems silly to spend so much time studying something useless, when one could instead spend that time on learning something more useful to real life. In general, standardized tests promote this kind of ""fake learning,"" due to their rigidity and the relatively short timeframe that they are administered in. 

&#x200B;

However, let's say that we *need* standardized tests and grades to participate in society. Still, us gifted people can never win.

&#x200B;

**Gifted students are punished for challenging themselves**

When I was in elementary school, I went to a fairly normal private school. Many of you can identify with the experiences that I faced there. I was constantly bored in class, and no matter how many times I asked for acceleration, the school would never give me the true intellectual stimulation I desired. I am not going to go into too much detail here because I think most of us understand the issues at normal schools.

In middle school, I was finally able to go to a (private) gifted 6-12 school. At first, there was an adjustment period at the new school, since the workload finally challenged me. I had to actually study for tests and spend a significant amount of time doing homework. However after the adjustment period, life was great! I would say that overall, I was fairly happy in middle school. (Except 8th grade was online for the whole year which sucked)

Fast forward to high school, and I am now realizing the flaws with the college admissions process. As a gifted student, my parents and friends expect me to get into an Ivy League school, and I know that I would feel inadequate if I do not get in. Unfortunately, the college admissions process penalizes students who want to take challenging classes and learn things by expecting perfection on every application. Since my school is for gifted students, and consequently more difficult, it makes it more difficult to get straight As, even though many students at my school would have easily gotten straight As at a traditional high school

Colleges also have quotas on how many students they can accept from a certain school, which disproportionately affects my school. Many of our 12th graders deserve to get into these colleges, yet cannot because of the quotas; they can only accept a few people from my school, even though everyone would be the ""top student"" at any other school. Moreover, the matriculation at my school generally ends up not being better than other schools in the area, even though the quality and rigor of education is far higher. 

The point is this: It seems like gifted students have to make a tradeoff in their education. They can either challenge themselves and potentially get bad grades, which lowers their chance of Ivy League admission, or they can be bored to death in easier classes, but have an easier time getting accepted into college.

"Figuring out the whole adhd+gifted thing Hello everyone. I recently found out that I have adhd and that I’m gifted so I’m processing it and things are starting to make sense. 

I never had trouble understanding things, never faced anything challenging (academically speaking).That can’t be good development-wise. For most people things aren’t as easy so they actually have to use their brain. But mine just feels atrophied, like it’s never been used. Not completely because I’ve always gravitated towards more complex stuff, I did a lot of reading by myself, but still, it doesn’t make up for growing up without intelectual challenges.

"Will it ever actually get harder/easier? 1. Will it ever actually get harder?

I am currently 16 and going to school in Germany. For me, most stuff is simple. Now it is dependent on my interest about a topic since I suck at most Languages but some examples:

1.I'm currently studying math and computer science parallel to school (on a bachelor level) and I don't regard it as difficult in any sense. While other struggle for days, I solve everything in minutes.

2.Basically any competition I enter I get to the 0.1%.

3.After 5 months I can play instruments like other people can't after 3 years.

You get the idea. This might sound like I'm bragging 'look at me I'm so talented' but in reality I'm dealing with serious issues.

2. Will it ever actually get easier?

People always assume it's so great to be talented in certain areas. Well it's not:

1. I can't sleep. At any point in my day I have a ton of thoughts going on in my head. That can not only be greatly distracting but it especially sucks when I want to sleep. I will normally have to wait for up to 2 hours.

2. My mental health issues are becoming more and more serious. Not being able to relate to people is one thing but not finding challenges is even worse. What's then even the point of living? 

Yes, I'm far from perfect and my talents are limited to my interests, yet I have never felt so shitty. 

Will it ever get harder/easier?",0
"Gifted people and the searching for problem partners I recently started reading material that made me think a little about relationships.

At first I thought it would be normal for these people to seek similar companies. However, I realized that it is more common for these people to seek partners who have social problems, neurological disorders and others.

More specifically i think that they need to have  someone needing their knowledge. A search for balance, not a search for equals or a search for a love that loves back, they need someone who needs them.

Although in the end love may end up emerging through coexistence, I still have doubts. Would this relationship be durable? What if one side becomes independent of the other and that balance is broken?

These are just some short considerations that I thought it was cool to share and I would like your opinion on this subject and personal experiences as well.

"Searching for Participants in my little Experiment. Testing would take place on the website Brainlabs.me, which was developed by The Cambridge University and has been validated for more than 20 years and has since published over 300 studies. (If you're overthinking about it being not legit, do a quick google search and see for yourself :D)

It tests areas such as Information processing speed; Auditory/Visual short-term memory/Working Memory, as well as Logical and Spatial Reasoning and Perception.

The tests on Brainlabs are designed in such a way that you have to practice to get better in some tests, until you reach your personal cognitive limit, which is different for everyone, depending on their intelligence profile. So you can also look and quantify how you are functioning that day. 

The site requires you to register, but you don't have to provide any real data when registering, so you can make up a fictitious email and password (Don't forget it :p).

What do I hope from this? 

To prove that every human being, depending on his intelligence profile, has a different maximum potential, which cannot be exceeded. Also, because the tests must be done multiple times, it is suited for people who have test anxiety, Aspergers and ADHD, because those profiles tend to have significant fluctuations in their cognition. 

Furthermore I hope to prove that these tests have a good reliability and validity to keep up with tests like WAIS IV and Stanford Binet. Also, i think this kind of testing can be a lot more valid, since momentary capturing of ones cognition can be fatal, aince some people can't perform to their potential. I can relate. 
(Brainlabs already conducted a Reliability/Validity Study, which show's a correlation of .67+ to g) 

I recommend the following tests: 

Feature Match: Information processing speed 

Spatial Span: Visual-Spatial Working Memory

Digit Span: Auditory Working Memory/Short-term Memory

Monkeyladder: Visual-spatial working memory

Double-Trouble: Inhibition Control

Odd One Out: Logical Reasoning

Rotations: Spatial Perception 

Don't get discouraged about your first results on the test;
You need to take each test probably 10-20+ times. After about 20 tries, I need your first score, your average score and your highest score, on each test listed above. You can do the Tests whenever you feel like it :). 

Also, I need your Device name (iPhone 13 Pro, iPad Pro 11 (2020), etc. 
This information is needed for latency reasons, since every device has a different Screen Refresh Rate, as well as screen sampling rate. 

I already collected scores from 43 individuals, with varying IQ's/cognitive profiles. Scores show very high correlation between my Theory, hwich doesn't suprise me that much, since higher intelligence is quantifiable.

"Would it really be worth getting tested as an adult? I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to post this, but I just want to talk about this and get some feedback/advice.

For context, I'm (24) physically disabled, (spastic quadriplegia and vision problems+ some less relevant physical disabilities.) Due to that and a lifetime of trauma, including abuse and neglect I was not really given a fair chance in school. I missed several years of formal education and often didn't have my disability accommodated when I did have access to schooling. I basically taught myself and still graduated as a member of the national Honor society in high school. However I grew up thinking I'm stupid and incompetent and I still feel that way now. I also live with documented CPTSD.

After getting myself out of my last bad situation and finally seeking therapy, I've had some mental health professionals suggest I'm highly gifted. I've been thinking about getting myself tested so that I can have some closure and ""know for sure"" because I've never had an IQ test.

However I'm worried, would they even be able to get an accurate score for me with my disability? (Like would I be able to have things adapted or have accommodations?) Are there any benefits to getting tested as an adult? What if I'm just full of myself for wanting this? The only things I can really see myself getting out of this would be closure, and maybe some social opportunities. I doubt it would be that high, but if it was, I'd probably join Mensa or something similar for social opportunities.

"2e assessment/diagnosis - how did it go for you? Hey everyone - I’m learning more about myself every day and think I could be more than gifted - potentially also ADHD and/or ASD.

I’m 30M and have only started to tune into my thoughts and feelings, reflecting on my experiences as a child and, later on as an adult.

As there appears to be overlap between giftedness (which is the only constant/certainty in this for me), how can you differentiate between the traits exhibited by ADHD/ASD and giftedness? I appreciate this is the role of a professional, but if they don’t recognise/understand giftedness (and only diagnose ADHD/ASD in non-gifted), could this not result in a misdiagnosis? I’ve also thought that the AQ10 and the like may not offer a ‘true’ score in a gifted test taker, as they may have masked most of their life/their higher IQ counteracts the typical traits.

Can anyone offer their thoughts and experiences on this? The more I read, the more confusing it gets. I ideally want to speak to a professional who just ‘gets it’, rather than going around the houses (and paying a lot for it) to arrive at a misdiagnosis from a professional who cannot see the WHOLE picture.

"Can we save the world? I've been watching too many Kurzgesagt videos lately and giving myself existential crises. There seem to be far too many complex, wide-sweeping problems such that we cannot solve them in the self-constraining time limits provided to us.

My idea is that we map the connectome and then build a physical re-representation of the brain that can function as a quantum computer. This artificial brain would likely take up about a square mile since we need to be able to practically manipulate the realistically-sized subcomponents (equivalent to neurons) and perhaps if it becomes conscious, add additional networks through common semse alterations that could improve memory, abstract reasoning and creative consciousness at a level that allows us to access ""neuroconstruction"" technologies which can benefit our own brains based off of the empirical observations made in the Sourcebrain. 

So we could essentially hardwire our own minds into a new neuro-substrate using the advice of a greater intelligence than our own, which we created by ""playing around"" with cognitive neurology until we got it right. Then we could construct additional sensory and motor systems that allow us to create a distributed network across the planet which can monitor world-ending problems at the source by having a LARGE and HYPERCONSCIOUS system-being provide for all of our wants and needs via advanced problem-solving and essentially alien technologies that are needed to stop this (these) disasters as they come before it all ends, before each and every one of us turns to inert dust, first preceded by a long period of pain and unbearable suffering.

I’m going to try and get an assessment ASAP, but I would love to hear your experiences to see if anything rings true.

School - very quiet, reserved, creative, small number of friends. Bullied at primary school but was far worse at secondary. Hyper alert. Profuse sweating. Fight or flight feeling all of the time. Struggled to interact with others (very low self esteem, especially girls). Very analytical and observant. A strong desire to have my own business at an early age.

Home - many interests, I tend to explore them intensely, love learning and sharing knowledge with others. Like my own space, not very ‘touchy feeley’. Don’t tend to initiate romantic behaviour with partner (I will normally wait).

Work - Fight or flight, hate repetitive tasks, get annoyed/frustrated with managers who pretend they know about stuff when they are wrong, but I tend to play dumb to keep relations happy (I hate confrontation). Hate being put in a box/job role when I have much more to give. Get bored easily and need novelty/complexity. A strong desire to be self-employed/do my own thing/always doing side hustles. Incredibly detail-oriented with intense focus. Perfectionistic.

Social - Hate social events, like making people laugh, don’t like going places by myself/agoraphobic, hate being centre of attention/spotlight syndrome, hate small talk. Don’t like going out with big groups (one friend is fine!). I think I make strong friendships via specialist interests. Very reserved and quiet. Hyper observant - like I’m a secret agent and can pick up stuff others don’t and view things in third person. Very good at reading others.

"Social interactions are draining me. What should I do? Social interactions, and on the overall the amount of social and sensory informations my brain processes and over-analyzes, are draining me. Today I reached a point at my internship where I just locked myself in the bathroom and forced myself to cry because it was the only way I found to evacuate this overwhelming.

As far as I remember I always had this shyness and this feeling of being different/apart of this world.

This is really causing me difficulties whith connecting with others and maintaining deep relationships. I'm starting to feel pretty lonely because I am pushing a lot of (good) people away and claiming my independancy (I don't need anyone and I don't need anyone validation). 

But at the same time I invested myself in a lot of activities where social contact is required because I thought it would help me feel less socially awkward (and it's actually not the case).

Every time I interact socially with someone at my internship I want to bang my head against a wall.

Do you have some tips for me? What is happening with me?

And do you think I should speak about that with my supervisor/boss (this is an intership at the university so there are quite cool and open)?",0
"Constant feeling of pressure Recently, I have constantly felt pressure in many ways. Like I feel pressure to start a business worth millions or become an important worker in a huge company known all around the world. I have this feeling that by becoming just a regular worker, I will waste all my potential. At the same time, I also feel like I am somehow expected to achieve something big because of being gifted (by society etc.). Now I already have some big academic and intellectual achievements (too many to mention here) but I feel like a vast majority of people wouldn't care about them and would find them worthless since they aren't ""the real world"" (you know how they say that grades don't actually matter if the person does nothing useful in the real world?). I already don't really get validation from the people around me (like nobody seems to actually find these achievements worthy, nearly nobody comes and asks for help, very few people acknowledge the achievements, etc). And from those who are actually supportive I mostly ever hear ""you are so smart so you will for sure do something huge for the world"". Now I know that these people are just trying to lift me up, but for me it is ""either you do something huge for the world or you will not get any validation or appreciation like right now"". As I earlier said, it also feels that if I don't do something huge, I will just waste my whole potential. It also think it is too late for me to think about this type of things. I am 20 soon and I would have to start from complete zero, I did not even have any real hobbies when I was younger.

So in conclusion, I constantly feel pressure to do something big, because otherwise I'd waste my potential, I'd get no validation, and because my current school achievements don't seem as worthy as I previously thought :( I don't want to be that one person who everyone sees as ""the one who wasted all their potential"" or ""the one who isn't even able to do anything useful in the real world outside of school"". And others saying ""you never know what might happen"" doesn't help me much either, because what if the scenario is that nothing ever happens at all? How does one get rid of that feeling of pressure, and what can I do to not waste my potential despite not doing anything ""big""?",0
"How do I know if I'm a gifted kid? I've been really confused lately since I found out what a gifted kid was. In school I aced most things quickly, such as math, English, and social studies. Most kids just copied of my answers so I got in the habit of finishing my work quickly so they could copy. I know I'm not as smart as everyone says I am. I panic whenever I get a bad grade (even when it's not my fault). Am I considered a gifted kid. (By the way I'm 15-ish)

Edit: I messed my age up and just realized when looking at the newer replies. I am around 13-14. I think I might've miss clicked and pressed the 5 instead of 3. Sorry about that!",0

"Our first grader is bored and getting in trouble... Per the title, our child is already having a rocky time at school...for me, it all started in 5th grade, so I thought we had some time lol. 

We strongly suspect he is gifted (probably mildly)...he is reading at least 2 grade levels ahead, and with math, he's ahead at least one grade level. Absolutely loves learning, reads sometimes multiple chapter books a day, does math at home for fun, and has so much energy. Yet we've been getting calls about his disruptive behavior. 

His teacher seems to not grasp giftedness much, other than saying that she notices that if he's not stimulated, he acts out. So the teacher is trying to differentiate, but I think her efforts are very limited. I've asked, but don't get much of an answer. She's totally overwhelmed, as she has 17 boys out of 24 kids.

Should I worry? At one point, our son was saying he felt like a bad boy because he couldn't control himself, and he says he is bored a lot. The teacher does have to have him sit away from others sometimes because he's distracting kids who are still learning to read, etc.

We've looked into a couple of options for next year, but he doesn't want to switch schools, probably because of his friends. He says he likes school these days. I'm a former teacher, so it's all hard for me to watch, as I want him to be challenged and avoid being stigmatized because of his behavior. I also don't want him distracting kids who need the education or making his teacher's job hard. 

I homeschooled him for 1.5 years during Covid and so I know his capabilities. And I love seeing him thrive. Sometimes I really want to homeschool, but I think I would go crazy. I need the stimulation of my career.

He is our only, so I also know I have a tendency to obsess over him lol.

Would the later grades be when it's more pressing to be sure he's getting challenging content, or should I act now?

Any thoughts are appreciated.",0
"Do you find Growth in Strict Linear Thinking or Loose Thinking? The question may sound a bit off but it is a sort of quest / wonder and a dilemma i'm facing. 

To me, it seem that gifted persons are prone to make connections between different topics through a web thoughts topology. This thought pattern sounds prone to dispersion and more likely ADHD diagnosis but it seems extremely natural to me. 

My dilemma is whether I should struggle and adopt/ revert to a linear thinking or shall I respect my natural instinct to let my thoughts wander. This natural instinct can be translated into excitability as reward of thinking that way. While linear thinking gives me the impression almost of fear of missing out.

I'm looking for testimony about such awareness / knowledges on the matter or the answer to the question on how is it and what is working for you ?",0
"Do you have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD)? I found out about it a few months ago, didn't know it had a name. I've had these symptoms for as long as I can remember.

Often when people ask me something, I struggle ""hearing"", so I'm like ""what did you say"" and half-way through the second time they ask this question, I finally ""hear"" it and can answer before they finish. It's frustrating bc my college teachers (and some students) think I'm stupid because I ask dumb questions or ask for them to repeat (idc what they think most of the time), just to be sure I heard well.

Another example: I often mishear sounds, like it's just a sound but in my head it sounds like someone talking for example.

"Trouble with pediatric therapist Hi there!

We've been having a challenge finding a therapist that ""gets"" our 12-year-old son. He's gifted, tested in the 99th percentile when he was 8, has ADHD, and was just diagnosed with high-functioning autism (née Asperger's) after a full neuro-psych eval which puts him firmly into the ""twice exceptional"" category. 

Forgive me in advance, I can be pretty verbose.

We're on his fourth therapist now, and we're having a difficult time figuring out if this guy is the right fit. He's experienced; he's a PhD and probably been doing this as long as I've been alive. He does IQ testing. We just feel he might not really understand the 2e aspect of our son. There are some specific examples I can get into that make us wonder if he's really listening to what we're saying and if he really ""gets it,"" but I'll try to keep to the main concern to keep this as brief as possible.

I've gotten a bit ""bristly"" with some of PhD's thoughts and advice. I am trying VERY hard to be really objective and mindful of my own insecurities and codependence, so I can usually calm down and understand what he's trying to say after a while, but we clashed a bit over something in this last appointment that has me reaching out to the gifted community to see if there are any insights into this.

My son is very much a logician. I am, too. He's very prone to many of the emotional outbursts that can come from a 2e male, but when he's mostly emotionally level he's extremely logical. When he's upset (not explosive like he gets sometimes), he and I can get into a logical debate about why he's upset, why things are the way they are, and what he can do about it. He usually walks away from those conversations feeling better, makes better follow-up choices, and shows appreciation for the discussion. These discussions are often the result of him clashing with my wife, who is certainly more emotional than logical, which causes a rift between them and their communication.

PhD says that such discussions between him and I aren't really beneficial, and can actually ""cause"" things like oppositional defiant disorder.

The explanation is that, if my son is upset and he doesn't get that logical explanation from whomever he's upset with, he can fight back and get defiant because he's come to expect a logical reason for whatever is going on. Further, PhD says that we are the parents, and sometimes our son just needs to understand that we know better and he just needs to comply. If my son wants to understand galaxies, why cold-blooded reptiles need to sunbathe, or get into an existential debate about why we're here on this Earth, we can have a discussion like that. But if it's about obedience or compliance, a simple explanation should do in most circumstances, or sometimes we just need to put our foot down and say ""because I said so.""

During this session, my son kept saying things like ""But those discussions really help me. They help me calm down and understand."" That broke my heart because I feel that's true.

Now I know I'm the parent of my son, and I know him much better after 12 years of life together with him, versus the one-hour-a-week PhD has gotten over the past few months, but I'm not sure whether to capitulate here, or keep doing what we're doing because I feel it's the better approach. Or maybe there's something in the middle? I'm just confused and frustrated because of the dichotomy between an expert's opinion, and my parental intuition. I get what he's saying; it makes sense that if my son comes to expect a logical explanation for everything that he's going to be disappointed in life because things aren't always so cut-and-dry.

So, to get to my questions:

1. Has anyone had a similar experience with a logician child that appreciates and seems to get value from a respectful debate when they're struggling with understanding something at home? How has that worked for you? Do you feel it's better to explain or to just dictate (for lack of a better word)?

2. Are there any opinions on whether or not the therapist is understanding of the 2e aspect? I know I didn't give many examples so this might be difficult to answer, so maybe I can make a follow-up post that's more specific about this therapist and the struggles we've had with him and others in general? I'm open to opinions and suggestions here.

"Gifted + Dyslexia experiences please Hi.  I'd like to hear experiences from anyone who knows themselves to be both gifted and dyslexic.  

As an adult I've informally tested as ""moderately gifted"" a couple of times, and this fits with how I did extremely well academically at secondary school (11-18), and eventually went onto postgrad study.

However, my primary school experience was a real struggle.  I was (one of) the worst and slowest readers in my class, getting in trouble because the teacher didn't understand I needed more help.  That teacher told my parents she thought I was ""backwards"".  I remember knowing all the answers though, just as well as her favourite pupil, but couldn't get my hand up that quickly.  Then something clicked around age 10 and my reading finally improved.  This coincided with my moving rapidly up the spelling groups, I think because I was simply good at memorising (I didn't generally recognise the words at all before having to memorise those lists).  In my final year at primary (10-11) there was huge emphasis on us increasing our written work speed so we would be ready to transition to secondary school.  The other kids would always ask me the answers (to comprehension questions etc) because they knew I always knew the answers, but I was just so slow at getting them down on paper that I rarely finished and still looked like bottom of the class.  There was a huge chart on the wall and we would get a gold sticker for every finished piece of work.  In a a class of 45, I was one of two people with no gold stars when everyone else's line of stars had reached right the end of the chart.  The friend I sat with at the time, who was similarly slow, has been assessed as dyslexic as an adult.  As it turned out, my primary school's obsession with working fast was entirely misplaced, because when I got to secondary, any work we didn't get done in class was simply added onto homework.  Finally I was able to take as long as I needed!  And to work alone in peace and quiet at home. 😊 This is when education finally took off for me and I started excelling.

I selected fine art, maths, physics, chemistry for A level (no essay/language subjects, although I got As for English at GCSE).  Then went onto a science degree.

Later, as a postgrad, while reading difficult research level texts, I started to wonder if I might be experiencing some visual stress that was making things harder.  I saw an optician who claimed to offer suitable assessments (I now realise it was probably massively inadequate).  The assessment all went fine except for one page with writing in two different fonts.  One of the fonts was so crazy I was completing overwhelmed and didn't even parsed her verbal question properly.  The disorientation was so much that I failed to express how completely thrown I was by the page. From my mistaken misleading answer, failure to say anything about the crazy font, and because I could read aloud at a normal speed, the optician concluded all was fine.  I had left the optician's, still in a daze, before I realised what had happened and it was too late. 🤦  So my attempts to understand at that time didn't lead me to any answers.

Fast forward to my forties: my home educated daughter experiences persistent difficulties picking up reading and an educational psychologist assessment confirms dyslexia.  My young son meanwhile develops an astonishing vocabulary that seems completely inappropriate for his age.  

Cue my reading up on both giftedness and dyslexia/specific learning difficulties for my children.  This causes me to recall and reflect on my experiences at primary, and realise perhaps I may have a mix of both.  😯

This was all surprising.  Since I'd done fine at secondary/GCSEs/A levels, I'd not understood how I could have a reading difficulty.  And I while knew my IQ from some informal tests in my twenties, no one had mentioned it counted as ""gifted"" - I didn't find out until reading up on the subject for my son.

My gifted experience doesn't fit the literature's descriptions of gifted kids coasting through earlier years of education with little effort.  I always had to work so incredibly hard all through school!

So it seems these two very different abilities have partially masked each other??


Now:  I'm considering a future change in career that will first require a return to studying, in an essay-based subject. I'm wondering whether I can handle it, what the challenges might be, how best to prepare (I have a few years to do so).  And considering an Ed Psychologist assesment for myself.

I would very much value hearing from others with high IQs and a specific learning difficulty.
- Have you also found your opposing abilities appear to mask each other or is that not the case for you?
- Are there circumstances when you find one comes to the fore?
- Have you found ways to compensate/adapt for the SpLD and has that freed your underlying potential?
- How valuable would an assessment be as an adult in this situation?
- Are there any good resources on the giftedness/dyslexia combination?

Any advice or experiences would be great.  Thanks very much!

"Gifted with learning disability? My daughter is 8 years old. At 3 she could write her name and at 4 could read full sentences. She also has an uncanny ability to draw and write stories. At 5, following family and friends recommendation, I decided to evaluate her. She has a high I.Q (not genius level lol), and is gifted in reading, writing and drawing.  Her math levels came up ok and she showed no signs of dyscalculia (which I suffer from).  She never had a real problem with math until last year when she started showing signs of struggle. Her teachers have assured me she can do the math but she panics and ""believes"" she cannot do it. Recently it has gotten worse. I remember when she was 4 or 5 she could add easily... now she can barely do simple additions without using her fingers.  Yesterday she described her feelings when she has to do a math test and it sounded like a panic attack... sweating, heart palpitations, unable to focus...  In summary, she can write, read and draw like a 6th grader, but can't add 2+2 without using her fingers.  As I mentioned above, I suffer from dyscalculia, so it would not surprise me if she has it too.  Any of you can relate to this situation.

"I just found out I am Gifted close to my 30th birthday I have been struggling to fit in the society since I was a kid and had hard time making friends in school and after school. I always felt alone and I always blamed myself for it because I make situations awkward. In my late 20’s(last few years) I started to go in depression and early 2022 was my rock bottom so I started taking medication and therapies. It did help a little to come out of depressive state but I still couldn’t slow down my thoughts and how my brain was draining all my energy. 

Yesterday, I casually met a doctor though my wife who is specialized in working with gifted kids and we started talking about my mental state. She gave me Cambridge brain science assessment and after analyzing the results and with her experience she found that I have gifted brain. 

I feel like I just got another birth just by knowing myself and how my brain works. I was able to connect all the dots all the way to my childhood and it’s very overwhelming experience. I am not able to stop thinking about it since yesterday. 

I don’t find myself smart 90% of the time (because I get stuck in my thoughts and my ability to make decisions gets cloudy) but when I am able to control my brain and my vision is clear I am pretty smart. I learned about all the traits and I can relate to most of them.

"Was I a Gifted Kid? For all my life, I thought that I was dumb because of the grades I get on that 1-2 subjects, that subject is of my native language (Filipino) the same way how Americans learn English as their subject.

&#x200B;

Ever since I was 5 (First grade), I was extremely interested in Anatomy and Microbiology. I could name all the major bones, muscles, organs, part of the hearts all on the top of my head. Microbiology on the other hand, I had what I thought was a ""basic understanding"" of it as I was more interested in how the immune system interacted with viruses/bacterias/diseases.

The reason why I was so interested in anatomy & microbiology? Because my mom was a nurse and I wanted to know what the career of my parents were all about since our teacher always asked what we wanted to be when we grew up.

Not only was I interested in anatomy & microbiology, I was also interested in algebra & geometry. It was because, same way how I became interested in the previous topics mentioned, I asked what career my dad had which was that he was an Architect.

I asked what he did and what an Architect is supposed to achieve, he said that he commonly uses A squared + B squared = C squared. I searched it up, it was the Pythagorean theorem.

Me looking up the Pythagorean theorem online led me to learning basic algebra since I was confused as to how letters can add up to become other letters.

At age 5, I managed to learn at least some forms of basic algebra (x+5=10 ; x=5, 2x+3=9, x=3, etc.)

Though I knew a lot of the advanced topics, I never really did well on certain subjects in school, specifically English & Filipino. I only ever knew about how bad I was performing at those 2 subjects when I turned 6 when I received my very first report card. I got a 75 in Filipino and 78 in English (It is the equivalent of a D in the USA). At first I thought I did well since 75 and 78 was close to 100 until my parents explained to me how the grading system actually works, with a grade below 70 meaning you had to repeat grades and a grade below 80 meaning you failed/need improvement.

As time progressed, I was always at least 2-4 lessons ahead on the curriculum on subjects such as Math & Science. On 4th grade I was more familiar to solving simultaneous equations or harder geometry problems like finding the angles. For since on 4th grade I became really interested in marine biology, still retaining the knowledge of anatomy and applying it to marine biology, etc.

I never really was the ""nerdy"" kid, I was moreso the average kid that liked to play sports and mess around class since I never really took school seriously.

I told people my stories about school and I was pretty surprised to know that my friends said that ""You were smart as a kid"" and such.

Was I a gifted kid? For me, I don't think the knowledge I had was really that huge to be considered as ""gifted"", but moreso just smart. The information I knew as a kid is so easily accessible and had probably been by many on the internet by large educational channels to be considered knowing those things as ""special"" or ""superior"".  


Edit: I forgot to mention as to how I failed certain subjects barring me to be labeled as ""Gifted"", but then again, I was kind of advanced on certain subjects.",0

From 2014 to 2021, there was a time where I felt like I couldn't compose because of the ""gifted kid burnout syndrome"" and another thing that I don't quite want to discuss on this sub, but at age 19 I've returned to composition when I published my first microtonal piece, since microtonality enables me to do both music and math in one go. 12 notes is too limiting. 

While it's a relief that most of the tuning systems I compose in are systems that no one ever composed in before, problem is, I'm an adult. April 12, 2021 marks the ""rebirth"" and trying something new, but I won't ever get the same kind of appreciation I got before 2014. 

While I make elaborate pieces, the adult world requires a lot of ""usefulness"" and ""making money"". All the adult boring stuff, you name it. A piece with high degree of virtuosity does not necessarily translate to appreciation. I won't rant about it more because it will become r/lewronggeneration, but basically, adult love is conditional and everything you put out to the world, it requires proof as to why its useful, which is to me it's just...

"Having trouble maintaining long-term relationships? As it says on the tin. Does anyone else have trouble making social relationships (friends, family, romance, etc.) last long-term?

For more context, I'm the sort of person who grows close to, and also loses interest in, others very quickly. I suppose the best way to describe it is, if I'm no longer in a shared environment with another person, I tend to lose touch with them very quickly. For example, I stopped speaking to my high school best friend -- whom I would literally share everything with -- less than a year into college. We went to different colleges.

It's been the same with college and university friends, coworkers, and the few boyfriends I've had. And it's always been a very natural and gradual sort of ""losing touch"" where we speak less and less, until we don't really keep in touch anymore.

The funny thing is, losing touch doesn't really bother me. Despite me enjoying these people's company and recognizing that they contribute happiness to my life, I also don't feel like losing them is much of a big deal. I don't really think I've felt particularly sad or upset at a human loss before. And, as expected, I don't face any issues if I ever need to cut someone out of my life completely. Even though social relationships are fun, they're easily replaceable and I can find happiness and fun elsewhere.

I also don't have problems reconnecting with people I've lost touch with. That sounds like an oxymoron, but basically... if these people do come back into my life, I don't feel like there is/was any gap between us. Obviously THEY do though, and I've been accused of being a bad friend/partner, etc. Again, on a logical level, I understand why people would be hurt and angry. Over the years I have tried putting more effort into keeping in touch with people, trying to maintain that relationship, but I always end up getting distracted by new people, or new things.

I have varied interests -- I love travelling, hiking, shopping, painting, cooking, cycling, gaming; many of these are things I can do alone. I don't mind if others join me, but I also don't particularly feel like anything's missing if I have to go at it alone.

I'm posing this question here because I've always been described as gifted my entire life. It has always felt like just another label, like ""female"" or ""European"" or ""long hair"". I have clear goals for the things I do want to achieve, such as getting into college or landing my dream job. That being said, I don't know if my giftedness is the cause of/contributes to my current dilemma.

"Please help: overexcitability makes it impossible to function Tldr: feeling hopeless and stuck. Wanting to learn all day makes adult life impossible.

Edit: pls someone reply

I'm finding it nearly impossible to be a functioning adult. All I want to do is learn, and I mean that with no exaggeration. 16 hours can pass in the blink of an eye trying to untangle problems, getting to the bottom of some issue, understanding relationships between different subjects, cataloguing articles; all I want to do is read and learn. It's almost compulsive. It's to the point that I regularly evade important life responsibilities to read something interesting. I have obsessions, contending with existential and religious question much of the day. I also might struggle with imaginational OE: my inner world is the show, everyday life are the commercials. 

I can't focus at work due to this. A question is at the forefront on my mind and I find myself opening a new tab on my work laptop or going on my phone trying to gather more information. I'm (20sF, BSW) a case manager. Although I love helping the particular population I serve, care management has me bored to tears. Documentation, forms, notes. It's insufferable. I can barely do my own errands (and have gotten into trouble due to this) what makes me think I can help others with theirs? The anxiety (emotional OE in general) of feeling like I'm not doing enough or forgetting something is debilitating and sometimes I have to end work early. Messing up makes me want to harm myself and die. I'm just not a conscientious person.

 However I don't know what I can do. I'm not really good at anything. ADHD, possible ASD, poor perceptual ability, poor memory, and poor math skills. Whatever verbal giftedness I might have is mild. At the surface the problem is simple: go back to school, get a new career, ect, but the problem seems to be at a more fundamental level, something intrinsic about life itself that can't be changed. The cyclical nature of life, the tedium, just seems unnecessary and meaningless. I wish I didn't ponder these things sometimes. The anxiety makes me want to die.

I'm afraid he's not going to finish school so I was wondering if there are any international school or program for gifted or art out there but our financial status is not very good and we live in Europe. Please if anyone knows something",0
"how was your experience skipping grades? i was suposed to skip at least one grade, but because of external circumstances and general incompetence of a few people that had to manage  the paperwork,i didnt. At the time, i rember beeing super relieved because i was terrified of going to class with older kids, but now in hindsight i strongly believe not skipping grades fucked up my life, at least to some degree. Specially because now, five years later, i would already be in college, and i see my current life as absolute shit compared to going to college. I just imagine myself living alone or with older roomates, studying what i love, and taking my own decisions and experiencing cool shit and just get super depressed because i now have to wait an entire year of beeing treated like a fucking 8 year old and i really dont know how im going to make it. so could those of you that actually got to skip grades share your expirience?? so that i least know that some of us made it out early  :' )",0
"Do you ever feel scared or guilty to learn a lot because you fear being seen as condescending ? I even fear going to university to do a master because I'm afraid people will see me badly.

"not gifted but i need advice, how are you people finding friends and romantic partners with the same mindset as you? i realize the title makes me sound like an asshole but it's the truth, i live in a place where around 98% of the population is stupid, most men my age sell drugs and women have more faith in instagram than their own dad. due to poor life choices i haven't went to college (yet) so i'm having a really hard time surrounding myself with people like me.

this shit really hurts and i'm slowly rotting from the inside out, my friends abandoned me and people call me crazy because i decide to spend my time doing other stuff instead of what everyone else is doing.

how the hell are you guys finding normal people to hang out with? i feel like i'm going insane and i'm really going to go off the deep end if something doesn't change soon. i can't keep being alone like this, i need to be around 'normal' people i'm tired of being around bums and people with no ambition. what am i doing wrong?",0
"Discussion / debate topics of gifted group Hey guys!
Recently I made this post asking if there's interest to have a gifted zoom group (https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/xx74ew/online_discussiondebate_group/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). 

As a follow up, I'd love to hear if you have topics you would you like to talk about more or maybe even a fun debate about. 

Here are some of my ideas: 
- gifted kid syndrome, your experiences (might be a cool get to know one too tho)
- agrivoltaics: putting solar panels above farm land and crops
- globalisation and deglobalisation: where do you think is this world headed and what is it its future?
- gifted kid dating - how does it work, how easy is it for us? 

Happy to hear your suggestions, the group is in the making!",0
"I don't know how I can take this anymore So i'm 15 male and nothing has been going my way as long as I can remember. I was always and still gifted, but I can't make any use of it. I learned how to read at age of 3 and never had to pay any attention in lower grade in anything. I was good at everything but the closer we got to high school I couldnt really do anything.

So the things that fucked up my life. My parents got divorced when i was under 1 year old and I lived with my mother and visited my father weekly. My mom is amazing and I love her but my dad is the biggest asshole in the world. Everything was very strict on my dads home. I had so much anxiety and stress there. Well that is already bad but i'm also an empath and I couldn't show my emotions there. Nothing could be wrong and if something was wrong it was best to act like all was good. I had two younger half-brothers and never had any own space while visiting my father wich I needed badly always. I cry easily and almost everyday but there if I did I would have talk with my father for hours and that made it worse. At the age of 11 I decided I was done going to that shit place and got what i hoped for, but it wasn't easy. You need to be 12 years if you want to decide to not visit one of your parents but my school nurse said i was smart enough to make the decision so i got it. (haven't spoken to him in 4 years)

I liked sports and played football for many years but me and my mother wondered why i was getting more weight while being very active and eating normally. Doctors looked at things and diagnosed me with high colesterol levels wich in short means i am in stress state 24/7.

Now for 4 years i haven't been able to be a full week at school at a time and have intrest at nothing. I don't like school but I like being there sometimes. As an empath I love it when I get to meet my friends and classmates and teachers (well most of them). But after school I am so tired I can't really do anything, it drains me so much. I also can't stand when some of the idiots at school do stupid stuff and act like they own the place.

To add that I am also diagnosed with aspergers and that makes some stuff even worse I can't make myself do stuff i'm not intrested at. I'm also highly sensitive i don't like bright lights can't stand loud noises feel what others feel smell things easily and feel everything that happens and touches my body. I don't know how to study. For 7 years in school I didn't need to study fir anything as I knew pretty much everything so I never learned how to study (if that makes sens).

And all that makes me depressed (which is also diagnosed) and have no motivation in life I don't know what I want to do as an adult never had dreams, but as long as I can remember I only wanted to be normal have a job that I could live with and just chill in my home playing games in my free time and if I would be lucky have a partner but all of that is just stupid dreams.

It also makes things harder that i have sleeping problems can only sleep like maximum 5 hours in school days which makes me like an zombie if I can get out of bed. And when i don't have school I can easily sleep 12 hours. I'm allways tired from all of this.

In the last two months things have gone even worse nothing new has happened I just can't take this anymore i'm just at home while not being able to anything useful and being a waste for humanity. Can't go go school, not enough sleep, can't stand people, I need people as it's the only thing i know how to help my friends. I'm so sressed i have so much anxiety i'm so depressed and want to kill myself but can't do it cuz my friends and family would get sad. I feel so useless and can't do anything with my talents and i'm so angry why everything happens to me.

Thanks to everyone who read this and sorry if i made mistakes in grammar as english is secondary language. I just don't know what I can do as feels like I can't do anything. Evrything just feels so useless.

If you guys have any questions i'll do my best to answer them. And there's also smaller stuff that happened because of these things i didn't write but you can adk more spesific questioins about them and i'll answer.

Just wanted to tell you how shit life is and see what strangers on reddit have to say. :)",0
"Big shoes to fill and a crisis of meaning Being ""gifted"" is completely meaningless if you've done nothing with it, and I've done nothing with it. Less than nothing, in fact. I can't even hold down a job and I'm on SSI as a result (Depression, ADHD, PTSD). The fact of the matter is, I've known since I was a small child that my existence is incongruent with life in this world. I'm much too different. My interests align with that of next to nobody, the way my mind works and the way I regard challenges and menial tasks inherently does not allow me to be as productive as I'd like to be. I just get burned out to the point of physical illness if I even try. To make matters worse, I recently came in contact with my family after a period of estrangement and found out that I have four close relatives that have achieved high levels of success, from writing widely published books, to acting in movies, to being a highly successful influencer. While I wouldn't value doing the latter two things I mentioned in my own life, one thought cannot escape my mind. I am nothing. I only relate to people I meet who also turn out to be queer academics with master's degrees, while I myself have done nothing even close to that with my life, and even that is a limited level of relatedness. It feels as if my entire life has been defined by alienation, and this isn't from a lack of trying. I have a lot of friends. There are a lot of people who care about me, but that's a result of hiding my more eccentric traits. Meaningful conversation only occurs in my life once a year or so, but I wouldn't dare admit this to anybody in my life. Despite being able to relate little to people, I love my friends deeply and I would never risk alienating myself further. 

&#x200B;

On top of giftedness, I went on a deep dive exploring myself and my mind earlier this year, and I was alarmed by the sheer amount of deviation from the norm I experience. My entire world, inside and out, is expressed highly abstractly through synesthesia. It's as if my mind cannot be satisfied with a baseline amount of processing associated with normal functioning, so it processes those things through strange and highly esoteric abstractions. Even the concepts I'm describing now are processed and visualized highly abstractly in this manner. I have many rare presentations, a few with no recorded cases. There's also a chance I'm autistic, though a misdiagnosis is also likely, but that doesn't seem to affect my relatedness much given the amount I'm able to blend in to many social situations and I've found it easy to understand people. Perhaps I've had to learn how people work from a young age out of necessity, being what I could only describe as a minority of one.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, it feels as if I'm a polar bear trying to survive in the Amazon and my only sanctuary is a stream of cold snowmelt as it trickles down from the Andes, keeping me cool enough to bring a sense of calm amid the chaos surrounding me. The most difficult thing I've had to internalize is that in order to live in this world, I will have to disregard my more complex needs in favor of more rudimentary ones. It seems that for some of us, the fulfillment of our safety needs, second from the bottom tier of the hierarchy of needs, is the most we will ever be permitted to fulfill, with great struggle. I fear speaking about this, because it seems like society places giftedness upon a pedestal, where it frankly doesn't belong. People think they need to be smart in order to feel they deserve to me taken seriously, and people with more narcissistic or toxic tendencies often present themselves as highly intelligent for this same reason. 

&#x200B;

In reality, being somebody who's highly gifted, with exceedingly rare forms of various neurodivergencies  and having experienced a great deal of trauma, including multiple forms of prolonged abuse and being witness to and subjected to gruesome violence, I feel alienation to an extreme degree. A lot of people come to subreddits like these, often lurking, feeling as if they would be better off somehow if they were gifted, when in some ways, I would regard being closer to the statistical mean as having a leg up in the world in some respect. Whether or not I'd choose to be closer to the mean if it were possible is up in the air, since perhaps having a unique perspective on life could be valued, but I would like to be happy and content. There's a philosophical discussion that could be had regarding the value of happiness in comparison to possessing some sort of unique perspective or deep understanding of the world, but ultimately, if I'm granted only this one life, I would very much like to spend it feeling content. Finding that contentment is the greatest struggle I could ever imagine. I can go through trauma and process it, and perhaps use it as a way to help people, and I have done so with no intent to stop, but I'm living a life where my needs are chronically underserved and unmet and I don't know quite how to meet them.

&#x200B;

What ties all this together, forming my own personal nightmare is existential dread. The awareness that human existence is nothing more than the sum of biological processes and electrical signals. That our motivations are, at their core, not much more than instincts that formed as defense mechanisms that kept our ancestors alive. Instinct to reproduce, to stockpile, an affinity for social inclusion, the desire to have control over our lives and in some, the lives of others and our instinct for survival. The thought of all of them being bound to biological processes opens one up to the realization that as essentially clumps of wet carbon, most of the things we do and strive for are a result of us having the evolutionary tendency to take ourselves far too seriously. For this reason, I find myself ruminating about the reasons behind everything I do and desire. It's the classic problem of creating one's own meaning in a life which inherently has none. As a Jew, I've become more observant over the last two years, not out of the belief in a God, but out of this search for meaning. I am essentially an atheist. I'm aware that this is little more than a way to cope with inherent meaninglessness, and the idea of most of my choices being ways to cope with said meaninglessness is troubling in its own right. It makes me feel like a chicken running around with its head cut off when I think about my goals and ambitions. Suddenly, the prospect of having a happy life holds no weight. It's torturous.

&#x200B;

Uniqueness in general is misunderstood. Giftedness is misunderstood. I hate to fall into the trope of the person who feels chronically misunderstood, because by doing so, I risk sounding like an angsty teenager, but this is where I'm at, whether I like it or not. It's just that, if I'm to be okay with the fact that I'm nothing more than a literate monkey, I unfortunately have to live within the confines of biological needs that I've come to regard as limitations. I have to survive in this world. I have to make peace with the system. I have to make peace with routine. I have to make peace with hunger, thirst, tiredness, sickness, loneliness and death. I have to work with the part of me that fears finding myself at the end of my life with nothing to show for it and treat it with some degree of respect. I have seemingly insurmountable odds to overcome and I'm scared.",0
"Anyone here familiar with limerence? I’m questioning if my possible giftedness has anything to do with my proneness to limerence (extreme unhealthy obsession with a love interest to the point where you become blind to that person’s flaws). I feel like I can’t love a person in a normal way it has to have a lovebombing attitude, passionate sex, serving them, wanting to know everything about them, having them on your mind constantly, getting physically worked up at the thought of them, holding myself to high standards to satisfy their needs then beat myself up when I don’t reach those standards.

I feel like I only want it when it’s extreme love I get bored when it’s just a normal relationship with limited feelings. I have to be head over heels for them and want them in a pathetically obsessive way.

Some things that trigger them for me: being ignored then met with full attention again or having a small fight then console after it’s like it gets stronger after something negative happens. If they’re clingy then nope it turns me off so damn quick and have even broken up with someone for being so clingy. I love chasing someone and I love mysteriousness and unpredictability.",0
"Are the ""events"" of life neutral and only get their positive and negative labels through/because of our society? I've thought about it and I think there is no experience in life that is worse than another.  If I always drink alcohol to forget the pain of my mother's death (e.g.), then I blame her death for my addiction.  And that's how everyone handles every experience, isn't it?  For some it is the death of a family member, for others (with a different prioritization of their problems) it may be the father who is always working and never at home that is then the ""cause"" of the addiction problem.  For some it is an accident or unemployment.  For some, the death of a family member would be a blessing, while for others, the seemingly ""same"" situation would be a curse.  So does it just depend on what I make of the events?  There are probably societal distinctions between ""good"" and ""bad"" events, but life doesn't make a distinction, does it? 

Still, are the ""events"" in life random? Has everything it's cause? 
Perhaps what drives us into addiction or depression isn't the event, but the ""what if"".  ""What if I could have saved my mother?""  ""What if I had been a better kid?""  The desperate attempt to change situations that have long since ended in the past, that only exist in our heads and drive us crazy.",0
"Newly diagnosed! Hey everyone!

So...I got my diagnosis yesterday (giftedness + ADD), at 34 years old.   
It was kind of a shock to me! Most of my friends, who are almost all neurodivergent, were not surprised at all though! 

I was wondering if you had any recommendation of books/articles I could read to better understand giftedness and ADD/ADHD.  
Thanks :)",0
"What's next? After burn out  Excuse me for my language, English isnt my first language. 

Since may this year Im at home with a burn out. Not because I cant handle my responsibilities of my job description, its because I'm feeling responsible for a lot outside my job. For example the wellbeing of my colleagues in my team, the bad decisions of the management team, the lack of culture in the company and efflux of people. I’m only project employee. 

Since July the company let me go, because we both see no options to reintegrate back in my old job and with this company.

Conclusion: I’m at home, recovering from my burn out. Its my first (and hopefully my last) burn out. The big question that is keep spinning in my head is: What’s next?

I’m in my early 30’s, I’m gifted, HSP and multipotential. Probably I have ADD, only not tested (yet). With this package its hard to answer the question: ‘What’s next?’. So far I had different jobs, in different fields. The only similarity between the jobs is that I worked with people. At all jobs I didn’t stay any longer than 2 years. Because always after a few months, I start lose my interest in the function. 

So, do you have any suggestions how I can get answers to the question ‘What’s next?’. Please let me know!",0
"What is your reaction to alcohol? I don’t drink often anymore, i used to when I was a teenager (I’m not old lol, im 20 I just don’t like to drink anymore)
When I was more social it was necessary as more or less any social activity seemingly involved drinking.

When I was drunk with people I was fine, but sometimes, about 30% of the time I would just wander off from my friends. Being on my own when I was drunk led my mind to weird places. I’d fixate on how different i was, and how it is impossible for me to ever fit it. I’d get really cynical about this and feel a level of resentment for everyone else, like I am better than them. 

I’d think I was some sort of special being, given superpowers and nobody could even comprehend what I was capable of and that’s why I was so misunderstood.",0
"Online discussion/debate group? Hey there! 

I'm thinking about opening an online zoom group to verbally discuss all things related to giftedness but also maybe debate about things people would like to debate (history, politics, sciences, economics, tech.... whatever really). I'd reckon 5-8 people max so that we keep a good atmosphere. 

About me: i'm an undergrad student that likes to meet new people and have cool discussions. 

Let me know if you would be interested in something like that!",0
"I got laid off and I am trying to understand my inner contradiction Earlier this year, I left my position I had in a firm I was with for 4 years and I wanted to start my own firm. However, I wanted to also learn data science and software. So, I applied for a role as a senior software individual - I was transparent about the fact that I had little experience.

I got laid off two days ago after 2 months. The thing is - there are a lot of moving parts, the company is going through some financial crisis and a lot of restructuring and we got a few new people from another department into our department...

Additionally, I have struggled with ADHD my whole life. But, I finally took control of my ADHD this summer.

So, here is the thing - if I evaluate myself through my own metrics, in this past 2 months - I gained so much value. I basically was successful in picking up an entire new skill-set.

The thing is - my supervisor said, he did not feel I was quite at the senior position. And despite seeing that criticism are very valid, and understandable.  A part of me felt really hurt that I did not meet up to his expectation...

It feels a bit frustrating because even with the layoff - I did super well in this two months, and I feel I hit multiple goals I had set for my own self. Yet, I struggle to get this negative feeling out of being ""rejected.""

I guess it is complicated but I thought I share here because I find r/gifted is the few places that seems to understand some of these contradictions. 

ps: After writing - I think perhaps it makes sense to accept that my sense of rejection without judgement as valid emotion even with the contradictions because the self is so complex, and multilayered. ",0
"Need some career advice Hello everybody. I’m hoping you can help me out. I’ve been working the same job for three years now and I feel like it’s time for a change. Yesterday I applied for a job at a local university as a teacher, but before I proceed I’d like to know if this is the right track for me to follow. 

First some background information. I’ve worked as a marketing manager at a scale up for three years now. My team consists of 7 people and we operate internationally. We work on many projects, such as launching new products and designing new websites, to name a few.

However, I’m extremely bored and I can do my job in one hour a day. There are no possibilities for me to grow within this company. The next promotion would be to become CEO, which I don’t want. Then there are a couple of things I really don’t like in my current job, such as:

- Hierarchy and politics. People earn my respect when I know that they know what they’re talking about, which is often not the case. A fancy job title doesn’t impress me.
- The inability of people and systems to change. I see many processes which are just downright inefficient and for which exist easy to implement solutions. But oftentimes that’s a bridge too far and people tell me that “I want too much”. 
- The workload is too small. I can finish most projects really quickly and to my colleague’s satisfaction (at least, they say they’re satisfied). If I’m not challenged, I feel so bored I just want to walk away and pursue other things that really interest me. 
- Then there are other things but I don’t want to make this list too long. 

These are the things I genuinely enjoy doing and care about:

- Helping and motivating others. I absolutely love seeing people grow. I enjoy teaching them stuff I spent time studying and seeing how it makes their job easier or better. 
- Learning and discussing the things I’ve learned.
- Solving problems in a highly paced, chaotic, uncertain and unpredictable environment. This might sound weird but if somebody messed up I love digging into it and improving where I can. 
- Doing creative stuff, such as coming up with a new brand and thinking about how I would position it in the market. 

I’ve also thought about freelancing next to becoming a teacher. Would you guys think this combination would make sense? 

Thanks so much for taking the time to help me out.",0

"Twice Exceptional? Hi. I'm a 19 year old male. Here's my cognitive profile:

* Exceptional verbal skills, in terms of verbal reasoning, spelling, writing, and vocabulary. This is why I was initially referred for gifted services in kindergarten.
* Poor at mental arithmetic, but seemingly below the pathological threshold for dyscalculia. Despite this, I'm excellent at math in general. I slightly struggled in math initially since it was mostly elementary arithmetic, but I later excelled in algebra and more advanced math classes that are more abstract, such as statistics and calculus. I was taking multiple classes of this caliber before I graduated high school.
* I seem to have developmental issues with motor skills. I can be quite clumsy when it comes to gross motor skills, but tasks involving fine motor skills seem to be alright. I think I may have a deficit in proprioception.
* I never fit in with the nerds, jocks, gamers, or band kids in high school. I was an outcast.
* I'm very hyperactive, fidgety, and impulsive. I have an excessive amount of energy. These can be symptoms of giftedness or a psychiatric disorder, so I'm not completely sure.
* I have issues with sleep disturbances.
* I struggle to maintain eye contact. I often have to copy the social actions of other people in order to fit in, and I have some repetitive behaviors like finger flapping. I also think I had some echolalia symptoms when I was younger.
* I'm a crippling perfectionist. I often won't start something if there's a chance of me failing. This obviously leads to me never turning stuff in or doing important things in the first place.
* I have restricted interests, but they seem to be quite broad and they switch around frequently. Naval history, specifically the Pacific War, computing, math, information security, and a couple of other topics are the most prominent examples. I devote an excessive amount of time and effort into studying these.
* I have the ability to adopt a pedantic speech style (i.e. Asperger's syndrome/HF-ASD) or do other things to impress people, but I restrain myself so that I don't appear narcissistic or cocky.
* My short term memory or my working memory, one of the two, is quite poor. I forget things frequently, yet I did well in subjects like math that benefit from good working memory skills. An interesting dichotomy for sure.
* Excellent long-term memory.
* I have issues with maladaptive daydreaming, which is essentially compulsive or addictive daydreaming that interferes with daily functioning. I have no symptoms of psychosis. I also have trichotillomania, which is compulsive hair pulling. Both of these disorders are highly associated with depression and anxiety, and they seem to provide a form of escape. I've been doing these since I was a pre-teen.
* I seem to be developing purely obsessive OCD.
* My handwriting is poor, but it's still legible. I think my handwriting quality stems from my extremely fast writing speed. I already know what words I want to put on the paper, so I write as fast as possible.
* I was initially successful in college, but I've started failing. I seem to have some symptoms of depression, like reduced motivation for even basic hygiene and a loss of interest in what I used to enjoy. Some of them may be existential, since things that I typically overthink about are not really relevant to the current situation, like climate change or how efficient the engine in my car is.
* I have had passive suicidal thoughts.

Yeah, that was a lot. When I was initially tested for gifted services in 3rd grade, I was actually below the qualifying score on the CogAT that they administered. It's split into three sections—Quantitative, Verbal, and Nonverbal. Each section has various subsets. My school district didn't take into consideration your entire score, or your ""full-scale IQ,"" but rather a qualifying score in the 97th percentile on each section. Unsurprisingly, my quantitative score was just below the threshold despite the fact that I qualified in every other section. This disqualified me from gifted services entirely. I still received gifted enrichment, such as pull out, differentiation, logic puzzles, and participation in chess tournaments.

As a result, I was stuck with the regular students. I did alright in school, though. I had very high test scores (including on the ACT/SAT), but I sucked at turning in homework so my overall GPA was low. I was still able to get into top-tier state schools despite the fact that I had a 3.2 unweighted GPA in high school.

I'm a very self-aware person, so I began to think that maybe I had some sort of psychiatric disorder. Mental disorders in particular have become one of my new interests, so I've been down this rabbit hole of research for quite a few months now. I seem to have symptoms of multiple disorders—Asperger's, ADHD, OCD, and GAD primarily. I was actually diagnosed with ADHD-C and GAD from a psychiatrist, so there's that. I have a psychological evaluation with a psychologist coming up soon.

My intention with this post is not to be pretentious or come across as a psuedointellectual. I just have an interest to learn more about myself. A lot of my symptoms genuinely resonate with the people here, so I feel like I'm some sort of rare case involving giftedness and ADHD covering each other up, such that neither condition was ever brought up or diagnosed by educators. The daydreaming and hair pulling are likely just symptoms of anxiety and depression.

I was worried that maybe giving this information to a bunch of internet strangers was a bad idea, but I felt like this was a place where I could come forward and speak. This is sort of a compilation of all of the things that I've observed about myself over the past few months. I express a genuine worry about the existence of other kids and adults similar to me—people that were never really identified properly. If my psychologist identifies that I'm not gifted, I'll happily see myself out of the room.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",0
"Looking for resources for my highly gifted bf (childhood trauma) My beautiful and incredibly smart bf always told me he felt very lonely in his family growing up (and still is). We’ve been together for 2 years and only recently (he’s 27), after our couples’ therapist made a remark about how lonely it is to grow up as a gifted child, he started getting more curious about his upbringing and looking for resources to help him make sense of his solitude and how different he felt from his parents. He is also easily triggered by sensing himself being unheard and misunderstood by me (when we argue for example). I feel like it had to do with his unresolved trauma. He looked at the book “the drama of the gifted child” and said that’s not his experience so much. 
Is there any literature about the experience he describes?

**edit: he also struggles with extreme procrastination (ex. never managed to complete his thesis because he was too overwhelmed by the length of the writing process, although he actually finished the mathematical proof itself). When he assigns himself tasks he can follow through, but struggles to find a reason (or incentives) to complete tasks assigned to him by others without a strict deadline",0
"""You could be better when..."" => Never good enough I got first tested at 7 years old and later at 16 to confirm it. While not even that smart, only in one subset (math, spatial thinking (Maybe horrible translated)), I feel the circumstances still ruined me.

School was easy without really learning for it like for many of us, but this got me disconnected from my ""achievements"". Due to the giftedness there was no way to really fail it and due to not learning and playing games instead, it wasn't something to be proud of, nothing that I worked for, just the logical consequence of the talent.

At these times I couldn't see any reason to even try to perform better, there were no benefit to do this, school would still take years to finish, grades didn't matter to go to university. But due to presumably able to perform better it was negatively noted, that I'm wasting my talent (Like there is an obligation to use it for something?). In German there is a saying ""Perlen vor die Säue"" (see [1] for context), which rougly translated to ""throwing pearls in front of pigs"" or more freely ""wasting resources for nothing"". I can't remember how many times my mother said this to me.

So I got the feeling, that something isn't earned if there is no working for it involed. If I did well, it was due to talent, but if I failed, it was due to not working enough. This lead to a bad attitude and perfectionism. What have I achieved by myself and what is just talent? There shouldn't be a disconnect but for me there is one, sadly.

This wasn't limited to school. I played okayish chess (good at tactics, bad at openings) and was told that I could be much better if I would learn. Even while just gaming with friends the same thing happend with ""you could be so much better if you would play serios."", not meant to flame, we were all on the same skillevel.

I get that these comments aren't meant to be evil but these make me feel not like I could be better at something but that I am not (good) enough. Most friends don't know about the giftedness, so it just stood out repeatly, which is another problem.

Have you had similar experiences?

For me it helped a bit to find hobbies which I can just do for myself like photography, no need to measure myself with anybody else, so it is okay to be ""bad"" at this and not feeling like I have to be good.
And well, therapy, lots of it.

"What to create Starting a civ or society in many ways would be better than starting a company (or possibly not). Would work if whoever was doing it knew what they were doing

What to create, and why?

&nbsp;

And also What is thought by some of the most notable ppl to be some of the worst civs and societies historically? And why, need to know why

I do not like the current overall state of this world, and I believe the majority (>50%) of the world population is also unhappy with how this world is

Theres 3 biggest problem that really irks me:

1) Excessiveness

- This world is incredibly commercialized that leads to alot of excessiveness that isn't needed in this world, and all of this is incredibly wasteful, a large amount doesn't do any good in this world

2) Mega-controlled 

- A large portion of this world is heaveily controlled by a few group of ppl. Ya it was worst back then when there were fewer ppl or a single human that controlled everything, and everyone

- Technology sites are good and can be helpful, but currently like all? things, its mega controlled by a few

- Mega-controlled is fine if the humans had the best interest of other humans at mind and hearrt, but they dont, almost all of them are greedy ppl unlike the fewer humans proportionally that arent greedy

3)  Lack of kindness

- Pretty much all of the problems is because of most ppl in this world. That's why it's like this. Making the world better is one of the (few) worthwhile goals in life i believe. (And general ignorance and lack of knowledge)

These are just off the top of my brain, I dont think there are any bigger core/fundamental probelms than these 3. Are there any? And why?

&nbsp;

What are other worthwhile goals in life, and why are they worthwhile? What makes them worthwhile that we should look into them

I don't currently think that Machine learning is a good or a worthwhile endeavour in this world. Machine learning  would not lead to any of the good outcomes above, it would not fix or make better any of the core/fundamental probelms said. I dont remember which of the billionares said this, but its multiple, but theres others that said the opposite.  I don't know which is the majority view when considering most notable ppl



The current world is ugly, but I get that it was much worst in the past. What is thought by notable ppl, past present etc, to be some of the worst civs and societies historically?  And why, need to know why


I don't know how anyone could reasonably be happy with the state of this world. There are a few countries/places that do seem better and I do intend on moving there in future

Are there any sites that I'd be interested in? Just link",0

"I need some help Last year I finished my master's and started working. For some reason it is really difficult for me to find my stride with the the work. I quit my first job after 6 months since I was going insane. Since then I switched to private education, I now work 4 days a week. It starts out fine, then I find myself growing uncomfortable, followed by a slow decend into stress and feeling unsatisfied.

 How do people deal with this? The only reason I went today is  because they haven't paid for last month yet + I promised myself that if I do this 10 months I get to write my book next year. 139 workdays to go and I am not sure if I'm going to make it. The worst thing is, I have only been working here for a month of which I spent 7 days sick.

I prepared back up plans, I sent a mail to a different company to see if they can offer me a worthwile salary for 3 days of work instead of 4. And otherwise I'm going to be a mailmen or work in a bookshop. I am just afraid that I won't make it or ever be successful, since I can't seem to hold down a job.",0

"2.5 year old First time mom here so any advice welcome. My not quite 2.5 yr old is displaying a lot of signs of being intellectually more developed than other kids his age. For example he can count to 20, add/subtract simple numbers, read most of the alphabet, starting to spell out words and read them, can draw people and cars and also generally remember quite complex concepts e.g. why did the dinosaurs die out?. He's been speaking now in full sentences for a good year and now he's asking ""Why?"" a lot. Should add we are bilingual at home and he hears a third language through his grandparents. Havent done anything particular to encourage any of the above; he just observes and learns is the impression I get. He's otherwise a very sociable and happy kid and not advanced in other more physical areas (e.g. he walked late and is quite cautious climbing, just learned to jump). 

A few questions (thank you in advance): 


- is the above developmentally advanced? Google tells me yes, but I know the internet is misleading
- if yes, how can we better support him? Just follow his lead like we've been doing up until now?
- if yes, is this any kind of prognosis for the future? 
- He goes to daycare 4x a week while my husband and I work, but tells he me has noone to speak with as all the kids his age are speaking simple sentences and he just plays with the carer. Should I be pushing for something here? He seems otherwise very happy and the carers are very supportive and give him lots of attention.",0

"Do you feel the need to be the perfect human being? Since I was a child I've always wanted to be a flawless, cool and impressive person. This need ""worsened"" when I was bullied at school, at 11yo: being perfectly ""normal"" (in a ""people can't pay attention to me"" way) was my way to survive in this school and life in general.

A few days/weeks ago, I finally understood this need only existed to people-please, and that I've never lived for myself (it's a scary realization). I had to be the perfect daughter, perfect student, perfect friend, perfect girlfriend,... Each time I wanted to experiment something (clothes, makeup, date with my ex, hobby,...) I had to face negative & judgemental criticism (especially from my family), and I did everything I could to change that and become perfect.

For example, right now I want to have a perfect body, perfect grades, perfect relationship with people (strangers, popular students from my faculty,...),...

"Increasing frustration tolerance 👋🏼 My (23F) therapist brought up that I seem to have pretty low frustration tolerance, probably due to being gifted and not having to work very hard in school. If I’m not good at something right away, I give up; if a workout is too hard, I stop; if my mind is racing during meditation, I stop doing it. I’ve done this in the name of self-compassion and not forcing myself to do things I don’t like, but I think it might be beneficial for me to do this so that I can have more hobbies, have more emotional resilience, and just handle discomfort more easily. 

What thoughts and/or advice do you have on this? My current thoughts are this: start playing piano again, which I used to be really good at as a kid but am super rusty so I don’t play anymore.

I literally cannot stop thinking about whoever it is that I’m interested in and it has become a problem as I have started to invade other people’s personal space and time. 

I currently am in a casual “relationship” with a friend I care for deeply (we have both come to the realization on our own that we don’t want something serious and just like to have each other to lean on for the time being) and I find that I am unable to leave her alone. 

I constantly think about her, analyze how long she takes to reply, and what she says. I don’t want to spend every second of the day thinking about her, as I am pretty tied down with my education right now, but I find that I am obsessing over every little thing that is going on. 

Recently I showed her something from the journal I keep, and she started asking me about it. I started keeping it about a month after we started seeing each other, as a way to write out my emotions and process them, so that I could express them in a way that would make sense and not be too intense for her. I don’t write in it often (less than once every two weeks), but she said that it was borderline obsessive. 

I don’t think she realizes that saying that hurt me, but I also feel like she has a point.

Tl;dr: I occasionally write in a journal to process intense emotions regarding a casual relationship, and the person I am writing about has said that I am obsessive. 

Am I being obsessive? How can I deal with my intense emotional sensitivity? Is there something more than being gifted at play here?",0

"Unbearable existence Contextualism: I'm gifted

Justice of post:

I've been enduring such a multiplex existential dread, and I'm just clueless of what I should do. I decided, rather than subscribing to more damage I realize all of my internalizations considering I'm on the verge of insanity. I've been experiencing major identity issues, questioning the authenticity and trueness of what I claim to be. I'm aware I have the preliminary name, age, height,  countenance but the psychological aspect has been devouring me. I've been reflecting on interactions and previous relationships and have deduced that its objectively impossible for me to create a genuine relationship. I'm a pathological manipulator with the psychosocial insufficiency to stop. Due to me creating variations of my identity, I've omitted the ability to authentically evaluate myself. I've been obsessing over ideations of me due to my nonexistent identity, and these obsessions have mutually been concentrating on a specific imaginative/realistic feature of me. I've realized with this deduction, I haven't been able to love the whole me, only subjective captures of myself which despite understanding the secondary perspective that I should love the whole me, I'm simply unable to deviate. The delusional valuations of these features have been manifesting into delusions, questioning if the ""whole"" me truly possesses the acceptable qualities The flawed me deems. And due to the inconsistency despite physical proof of something. For instance; lets say I ideate myself as a strong individual despite logical demonstrations of my abilities, its inherently insufficient and unpleasable. And due to the overexcitability I become rationale to why I don't possess the given feature, creating delusional reasons or imagined experiences to how I alternatively lost them.",0

"Rant+ advice I’m a “child prodigy” on paper. I did amazingly well on a bunch of standardised tests at a very young age. I skipped a few grades and so I will probably enter college soon. 

None of this was of my own choice however. My mom pretty much forced me to do this, but for good reason. I don’t think it’s urgent enough of a reason to treat me like this for years on end, but I can see she clearly thinks it’s incredibly important. 

While this prep thing has traumatised me at least a little, I have no delusions that she might be a narcissist. She did this because she thought it was literally a matter of life or death for me, and I've finally realised that she did this entirely for my good. 

Anyways, you can debate me on this if you really want to, but I probably wouldn't find that helpful because that's not my main focus in typing this.

I’m worried that if I do get into a competitive university, or any university for that matter, I will screw up completely. 

For one, I have at best a moderate passion for what I'm applying for. I was passionate about it when I was younger but burnout and long term resentment killed it. I’m recovering, but I don't see my interest returning to a level that is enough for university.

I also have no close to no sense of urgency. Literally nothing stresses me out anymore, and I have no idea how I manage to turn in what little homework I have every day. 

Lastly, I'm not really that smart. Most people like me were probably incredibly smart, interested and pretty much self taught from a young age. Although I do take in math and science related information much quicker and more intuitively than the average guy, everything I know was shoved down my throat by a very effective teacher. 

I don't see these problems improving anytime soon. I also realised recently that I could very possibly flunk college because someone I know who is very much like me didn't make it. 

It's probably wiser to just not go to college, but a bunch of my test results are going to expire if I don't go. I have no wish to redo them. I also can't stand my mom sometimes and I don’t want to end up in jail for stabbing her or something. That would finish me off for good.",0

"How would you approach self-directed learning?  I want to create a methodology or framework for me to understand humanity. Or, rather self directed learning.   


Feel free to challenge me or add to this idea, but I have come to realize that to address global problems - we must approach the problem from at least these 3 dimensions, (1) understand it through our formal science, especially humanities, and (2) through the lived perspective of our members of our species and we must accept every member of our species experience to be equally valid - (3) and the other two sub dimensions is understanding the market framework and emerging technologies and application of such emerging technologies to address global problems.

I understand that understanding problems from perspective of many may be seen as problematic but I am someone who holds contradictions, and from this perspective - i want to understand contradicting views, values to understand where they emerge .

"How to deal with isolation? I believe I have psychopathy in addition to identifying with the experience of being gifted.

It's incredibly frustrating because it's like a permanent 3rd person POV.

People are an aggregate of their experience and emotions and it's always been frustrating to foster any type of relationship.

People are predictable and they always act in frustrating ways - my psychopathy lets me be detached - my intelligence lets me store large amounts of information and make connections very fast.

I have no visual memory, but if I see something once, when I see it again I can still recognize that it's familiar, even many years later. Faces, abstract patterns, landmarks, memories, facts.

Try as I might, it doesn't make for good relationships because I often understand in a detached way and predict why and how people are going to react to what I'm going to say.

I can't relate to people or offer what they need, emotionally, to foster a good relationships.

I'm good on the surface then long-term people get tired because they're not getting out of the relationship what they expected - and I don't blame them for that - but it still sucks.

Every time I've put these beliefs to the side and tried to meet people half way, I've been met with contempt, or emotional disbelief.

It's like I'm constantly shattering peoples' realities, all the time, just by functioning in my normal way.

And I understand  how that can be uncomfortable for anyone, but I just can't not do it - or I'm not being myself - and that's the exhausting part.

I can't show up in way people want unless I sacrifice large swaths of my natural functioning and put up a 'mask'. But, I feel that's disingenuous and so I'm resigned to just keeping to myself.

I'm tired. I've tried my best to do my job, but I guess I keep failing and making mistakes. I think my coworkers are secretly impatient with me.

It's so tiring to live with undiagnosed ADHD, in a country where accommodation for ADHD or other mental disability is nonexistent. I'm so tired of trying to find ways to be diagnosed with ADHD, or at least find a therapist who have a not-stereotypical perception of ADHD.

"I just found someone who compares giftedness scientific studies with astrology horoscopes Hi, gifted fellas. As the tittle says, this is what just happend to me a while ago. Let me explain you the context:

Recently, I found in a psychology subreddit a post that declared boys are more socially isolated than we girls, and as a person who have been living and observing the opposite, I disagreed.

I commented than introvert and shy girls (specially we gifteds and we tomboys) are easily rejected and bullied by other girls and boys, than introvert shy boys. A guy appeared mocking of my statement and I shared with him/her enough links about giftedness and the social rejection we gifted use to live, as evidence of my arguments.

Naive me, I thought him/her would be sensible and polite enough. This person answered me saying that the definition provided by this links (many from official giftedness webs like Davidson Institute or Enol Association) are contradictory and untrustworthy. This person didn't even make the lil effort to educate him/herself a bit before spoke this:

This person shamelessly declared that the giftedness' traits and description were as reliable and objective as an silly astrology horoscope... and yeah, this person shared the dull description of aries as an ""argument"" to support his/her point. Yeah, this person knew I'm gifted and yet dared to told me that.

I had heard/read all kind of discredits, slanders and jibes about us and giftedness itself, but never I had to struggle with someone who placed an incredibly historically well-documented psychological nature at the same level of a pseudo-science like horoscopes (not meaning to offence those who believe in astrology).

Independently of me being right or wrong about the matter of the psychological post, this guys unpolite ways and wicked baloneis are utterly insulting and unnecessary.
Deeply stupid is the arrogance. 

I still shocked after finding such illiterate vain morron in a subreddit specialized in human psychology, but I'm laughing about it. I'm a cheery girl and I have a good sense of humor.

I just wanted to share this surrealistic experiences with you pals. It isn't the worst thing I heard, it's not the end of the Cosmos, but it's so odd and cringy that is worhty a laugh.

Here I let the link to this guy's comment (cause I don't know how to include an screenshoot with the text), to you can read it by yourselves. Please, don't insult him/her, is a total asshole but I don't wanna start a witch-hunt.

"is (verbal)language a portrayer of reality, as something you could fact-check and then, ""ba-da-boom!"" understand real life situations from a scientific-logical point of view? is this even possible to answer this, or does this have no value at all? I mean, when we're checking a fact to be true (e.g., a criminal having taken such a bad move/action for his own purpose of VOLUNTEERILY doing bad (as for doing bad for the sake of doing bad and hurting other in exchange of 'owns pleasure/benefits)) for the matter of a law court judgement process (major case example), that will define the outcome of the subject of such actions' life, whether for the next years or all that remains. This 'cause we don't want anything to go wrong and do worse/bad to a person, or at least we're constantly trying to do our best at legitimating rights and musts of/for everyone in a society.


The point I'm making, is that, if verbal language is subject to a crime scene's actions, should we really consider it to be worth ""reading-through"" as for getting out any proof of validation of such intent of committing such crimes?
If so, what are the parameters or definition of, both verbal language and intent/intentionality of an individual may I ask?
And how do we explicitly and validly prove that that verbal-language proof of bad intentionality is directly connected or even, for the least, correlated to what the subject's real(?) intent is? Maybe it's gone undiagnosed of serious mental health issues, and maybe it's just as bad (the mental health situation) as the place he/she is put in?
How can we define intent/intention, as that same something that drives someone to do/take a certain action?

Really looking forward to some answers of yours, truly interested in this questioning of mine, and some other of you (I guess and also hope).

"Interest ""addiction"" + distinction from autism? TW; mention of suicidal and depressive thoughts/feelings in the spoilers

The title is a bit exaggerated but to be fair I did just stay up until three in the morning just reading and writing about stranger things fully aware that I have a project with a final due date tomorrow (after already having missed the first one).

I can't focus on more than an interest or two at once, and if there are more than one it's because they are related. I start getting into something, suddenly it's all I can think and care about 24/7, it becomes my reason to live (>!literally since I cling to anything that gives me joy to fight suicidal thoughts!<); I can't bring myself to focus on anything else, even things that I was all over just days before, to the point I start dreaming about it nearly every night because it's almost the only input my brain can draw content from.

I confirmed recently that my obsessions last about a month on average; two or more if it is really intense and I have a lot of content and ideas to draw from and exploit, and a couple of weeks if it is influenced by something else rather than coming from sheer internal interest or if it has little content for me to explore deeper and connect to more personally. Sometimes I get insanely into something and make it a core element of my identity only to forget about it forever weeks after, some are life long interests that resurface when there is a gap or something that reminds me of them and brings me back to it.

At first it feels like the force that drives my life and just thinking about my current obsession makes me feel safe from any problems, but when they start to die down it is tragic and frustrating because I feel like I'm losing what I thought was a key aspect of my life; some almost come as epiphanies at first making me feel like I've finally figured out what I want to do, >!only for me to lose interest on it and discard it and go back to feeling empty and without a purpose.!< I also feel like I'll never find that passion and meaning in anything else again, and then I do, and I think it's forever and I'll never get tired of this new thing, but the cycle keeps repeating either way.

It has felt more intense in the past years and it's starting to concern me for real because when it's not something obviously irrelevant to the course of my life like a show or a game, it can really mess up with my sense of identity and purpose. It also makes me neglectful of everything in my life because something as trivial as a tv show can completely take over my life and appear like the only thing that truly matters and the only thing I need to be happy and alright, which makes it even worse when I can't exploit that interest anymore.

Does anyone else experience anything like this, with this much intensity and shifting this quickly? I know giftedness has a lot of overlap with autism but I haven't found much on how gifted people experience intense interest and I don't know if this is closer to the autistic experience; the short span of the interest especially makes me doubt, but then again like I said some are life long but interrupted since I can't focus on more than one at a time. Obviously my suspicions for this being a sign of autism rather than just an aspect of giftedness alone come from a multitude of other factors and possible symptoms that make me doubt, but I still feel like this affects my life more than it should. I've been considering looking for a proper psychologist to discuss this uncertainty with, but because I don't know to what degree my experiences are merely the overlap of giftedness or if they are actually more akin to the presentation of autism, the trouble doesn't feel fully justified. Plus, I did the Wisc-V, which from what I understand is very in-depth and can identify autism quite clearly thanks to the comparison between the different subtests, and apparently there was nothing notable asides from the overall score. Still, I know if I don't get a straight answer to this specific question it will continue to come up in my mind.

If anyone knows how gifted and autistic interests are distinguished and experienced differently and wanted to describe it I would be very very thankful. I've also considered other things, like ADHD (ruled out for sure since it was the reason I took the test) and different types of bipolar (I don't fit the criteria and the presentation of it as a whole). I just genuinely don't know to what degree this is typical, either for a gifted or neurotypical brain.",0
"my troublesome gifted kid My son is 15 and has always been obviously highly intelligent, but also debatably has ADHD and behavior problems.  Like, it's been bad.  Lots of getting in trouble at school.  We always advocated that he's bored and needs an accelerated curriculum, but the interesting thing we always came up against was the school's attitude.  

It's like they see the gifted program as a reward for the good kids, and since my son has a reputation as a troublemaker, they never wanted to reward him (with an actual appropriate curriculum).  

He is in a kind of special education program right now because he can't get along with others.  It's an off-site tutoring program, and his new teacher, having got to know him in the last couple of weeks is kind of like ""WTF why are you here?  This program is for the slow kids.""  And he's finally under review for the gifted program.  They probably will send him to the university next semester.  

He is really into computer coding and has recently been running physics experiments on his computer from absolute scratch.  Like a screen full of balls bouncing off each other and losing energy with each contact until everything comes to rest.  He really wanted to take AP physics to learn the equations he needs for programming, but he's not allowed to access it from the special education program.  

So the cool thing is, the high school will probably send him to the university to take physics and another class or two next semester.  

Just, it's been a wild ride.  Can anyone relate?  Does this sound like a familiar story?  I'm kind of worried about a 15 year old at university, but I work there, so I would be nearby on campus.  His behavior problem is that he's so arrogant he pushes everyone's buttons.",0

This other girl I was talking to has cheated on me yesterday, and I am ultimately alone. 

 I don't have friends because I am too different.

Since suicide is not an option, and I am still not connected with humans I don't know what to do.

"Finding people in college I don’t think this problem is remotely unique to gifted people, but I do think that the gifted element makes it quite a bit more difficult. 

I started college a few weeks ago at a liberal arts university on the west coast with around 500 people in my class. I have made plenty of friends and I have people to hang out with, but I have yet to find people I can be myself around who will get me. I’m starting to worry that my hometown on the east coast was an exceptional place to find people more like me, given that it was a wealthy area with great education and a proportionally high level of gifted people. To clarify, I don’t think that “my people” will only be gifted people in terms of iq. What I yearn for is friends who share my level of passion for philosophy and other pursuits that I would consider more intellectual.

I went to a liberal arts college thinking it would be an even better place to find people to talk for hours about deep existential discussions, human nature, society, and so on. I had only a handful of friends back home for this, and I think I may have been foolish to expect much more here. But then again, this school has 2000 people so surely if I have patience I will find people? I feel so lonely having nobody who remotely understands me yet. The closest I came was at a party where my drunk self somehow ended up discussing capitalism with a girl. I thought maybe I found someone but then she stated she loves communism and thinks America needs it. I know I may just have to be patient, but that’s easier said than done.

Also, before anyone just says to “be yourself”, that is essentially what I tried at the start, and it resulted in people just being confused by me and my humor. People don’t seem to understand why I want to talk about politics instead of sex, clothing, tv, and other mundane matters of everyday life. 

So, does anyone have advice or experience? I would like to hear peoples thoughts who can relate or sympathize.",0
"Could I be gifted if my IQ is indeterminable? I had an adult autism assessment three years ago, after which I got my diagnosis. During that assessment I apparently scored very highly on the verbal ability section to the point where my assessor said that she would class me as being gifted.

I've been curious ever since about what that means, but all the definitions I've found have been related to IQ. During the same assessment, they weren't able to determine my IQ as apparently my abilities in each part of the test varied too much to get a reliable score. I guess that means I officially don't have an IQ (obviously I know that IQ tests aren't the most reliable things in the world anyway)!

"Contradictions when pursuing depth I’m still struggling to accept that I’m in the profoundly gifted range. 

There is a frequent pattern in my interactions with other people (and sometimes their works, like textbooks) that is absolutely mystifying.

An idea will be presented, and I’ll be confused and unsatisfied because so much is missing. The “big idea”, key assumptions, implications, context. There might be complexity that feels unwarranted or premature, details that aren’t justified. I’ll try to start at the beginning and this makes me feel very stupid (and often I’m made to feel stupid).

When I manage to push through all of this, it’s always very clear that I’ve learned more about the subject than they ever knew, or honed in on an important perspective that they hadn’t considered. I feel I become fluent in the “essence” of the subject and this kind of understanding is totally lacking on their part (though, they may be — likely are — faster in the mechanics).

In general, it’s very lonely, frustrating, and damaging to my very fragile self-esteem. There is a sense that I’m constantly fighting deception: people denying the truth of something that I can see plainly.",0
"Self compassion and invisible shame. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFN8t9SXiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFN8t9SXiQ) 

I recently came upon this video and It really was a breakthrough for me. I now know I misunderstood who I was and who I want to be. I have immense shame and self doubt about my value as a person, not my abilities. I believe I am lazy and useless, since I have not outshone everyone I know, even though I can recognize my natural gifts as being greater than many. This is the contradiction that shame has caught me in. It cripples my growth and happiness. Whenever I am doing work, I hate it because I believe I will be lazy and underachieve yet again, and whenever I am not doing work, I believe I am wasting my precious time and abilities. This has made my life a living hell. I cannot enjoy working, and I cannot enjoy relaxation. Every part of my human experience has been falsely pathologized and injected with shame. The shame I feel is not a deserved result of my state, but the CAUSE of it. My path forward is to first recognize the shame I feel as unhelpful, and ACCEPT it. It cannot rule my life anymore. Honestly this video has brought me so much relief. In the first time in ages, I feel no shame for just existing as I am right now.

"Defiance Lately I've been doing more research about giftedness and misdiagnoses (and missed diagnosis). I don't hear defiance spoken about as much (as least not in its own right) as adhd.

Imo gifted adults and pathologized entirely too often. I think people like the idea of smart person, but they don't want that person to have fire.

I've been called defiant in one way or another irl and online bc I don't easily capitulate to things I find stupid. My mom has always hated that I'm very active. She wouldn't let me do sports, and she said black people don't do ballet. She gets mad that I practice my flow arts. So what do I do? I keep myself in shape, take classes and play sports when I'm older and have money. I'm now an amateur flow arts/circus performer, and I dont invite her or any of my family to my shows! If I had listened to her and other naysayers, there are so many things I would never have done and people I would never have met. 

I hope one day to be in a music video, in a movie as an extra or on tv performing. I am told that I would never make it, etc etc. I take things as they come. I think if people worry about 'making it,' they lose a lot of opportunities and experiences in life. Some things in life may be a side hustle or a one-off.

I read an article about how defiant kids & adults are trailblazers. Agreed! I don't wait around for approval. I was the only black female at the nearest Hema group. I'd go more often if it were closer! If I want to train with scottish broadsword and other melee weapons, I'm going to do that. If I had the money, I'd probably be training as a helicopter pilot.

"Confused by WAIS Results. Would like some insight Hi,

&#x200B;

First, I should say that I don't think I am ""gifted""--maybe just ""above average intelligence"" (in certain areas, and clearly below average in others). But I thought that you folks on this subreddit might have some insight into the results I received on a WAIS test that I had conducted as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. I was being tested for ADHD and a processing disorder or a learning disability (and was not diagnosed with either, though I still truly think I have ADHD), and I feel that the psychologist who conducted my test did not thoroughly explain my results in a way that makes sense to me. I am wondering if she skirted over certain challenges I might have as I have what looks like a pretty significant discrepancy across different indexes. 

&#x200B;

Here are my full scale index scores:

Verbal Comprehension: 118 (88th percentile)

Perceptual Reasoning: 104 (61st percentile)

Working Memory: 133 (99th percentile)

Processing Speed: 94 (34th percentile)

&#x200B;

I'm noticing the challenges I had in both processing speed and perceptual reasoning in comparison to verbal comprehension and working memory, and am wondering what this might mean. I know that no one here can ""diagnose"" me but I'm wondering if you have any insight or guidance. For some context, I have always struggled significantly in visual-spatial skills (map reading, following directions, visualizing shapes/geometric figures, the list goes on) and this has been a weakness for me as long as I can remember. 

Appreciate any advice you might have.",0
"Realizing just how weird I really am Most of my adult life from 2018 to 2021, I focused heavily on trying to fit in. For the most part, I was able to develop quite a few different acquaintanceships and I appeared to fit in at the surface level. I got by socially because I developed a sense of humor and brought myself to understand how people think and feel. I became a social chameleon with multiple distinct personalities for different social settings. 


Two major events would turn all of this upside-down though. The pandemic and a highly abusive relationship where I would become isolated from my social circles. The abusive relationship ended last year and I found myself thinking a lot about my identity and who I truly was, since I had been running from it for such a long time. I had focused so heavily on how I could relate to others that I had ignored the things that set me apart, and there are a great many things that set me apart that have been apparent since I was a child.   


I joined this subreddit because I had discovered the term ""twice exceptional"" and resonated deeply with it. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD. The Asperger's syndrome, which I will refer to as autism from this point forward has been contested greatly by mental health professionals throughout my adult life. I've been told that I communicate too fluidly, my body language is too natural and I have a much deeper understanding of my own emotions than even the average person, let alone a person on the spectrum. I wasn't diagnosed with autism until I was 12 and at that time, I was also diagnosed with OCD, Major depressive disorder and general anxiety at that time as well. My ADHD wasn't diagnosed until I was 20.   


My entire life, I was told that I was highly intelligent but as far as I knew, there was no documentation of it. I recently opened up to my sister (who's 18 years older than me) about frequently feeling inadequate and stupid and she told me that during my diagnosis, I had been given an IQ test and that the results were ""very high"". I looked into my diagnosis to see if this was true and I discovered that I had scored 150 on that test, which was incredibly shocking to me. In the back of my mind, I always believed at some level that I was average or below average because I've only ever been able to understand things that I saw as simple and straightforward. While I've always felt that there is nothing in the world that is beyond comprehension, I've also always felt that I personally comprehended so little because I *do* comprehend so little. If all there is to comprehend in the world could fit into a library, I'm merely reading the directory.  


On top of that, over the past year, I've explored synesthesia somewhat deeply and discovered that I experience multiple rare and complex forms of it. The entire way I perceive the world is influenced by my synesthesia. While I know quite a few synesthetes, I've never met somebody who experiences it like I do. I even have a few forms about which I have found no documentation. While many people have told me how cool it is that I experience what I do, it has felt alienating.



Very few of my interests are common enough to relate to people about them. Most of my friendships and acquaintanceships have been formed without me ever talking about my interests or passions and I have made up for that socially with humor or by getting people to open up to me. There are people I know more deeply than they know me as a result. I made a post in this subreddit recently talking about how hard it is to find people with similar interests and a commenter suggested that I use meetup dot com. There are no meetups within 500 miles of me relating to any of my deepest interests and I live in Los Angeles. At one point, I was lucky enough to have a friend whose father was a professor in one of these interests and we would email each other on a regular basis, but it has been years. When I was a child, this lack of common interests was more impactful than it is today. I had no interests in any of the things my peers were interested in. I didn't watch any programming for children because I felt like I was being talked down to and popular culture was extremely uninteresting to me. Nowadays, people my age are surprised when I have no familiarity with anything they grew up with. As a child, I was one of the ""smart kids"". Some of my peers would ask me random questions in front of their friends and they would act impressed by the answers I gave, and other peers would be cruel to me for using ""big words"" what I didn't even realize would be considered ""big words"". I started masking in middle school so I would fit in better.



This is alienating. This has always been alienating. I understand that everybody is unique, but the realization that I'm incredibly weird and different is jarring sometimes. The only people I truly relate to are gifted in one way or another. I don't even need to have the same interests as them to relate to them, luckily, but it helps. For years, I've had to hide or suppress most of my thoughts because they alienate me. In the past year, I've made an effort to stop masking and to pursue my interests and discover new ones and it's been wonderful, but it also serves as a reminder that I am weird and different. It's horrifying to think about how difficult it is for me to meet my social needs sometimes. The times where I do become fond memories because they happen so infrequently. It's hard, but I know I need to work with what I have.",0

"Why is my iq so low compared to what I everyone, and what I previously believed? Im 15, never done an actual iq test before but was put into gifted and talented sets as very young child (5 years old - ironically the time I intellectually peaked). I fit the definitions of a gifted child as a kid but never did any formal testing. I don’t know why but after I moved schools at around 7, everything just started to decline intellectually speaking (lost enjoyment of learning, childhood issues). I coasted up to age 12 or so and still managed to get into 1/2nd sets - but according to teachers and family alike I ‘could’ve done so much better’. 

I’ve essentially questioned if I was really as smart as people claimed as I have serious doubts. Recently, I took the Mensa Norway, Finland and Denmark tests online - scoring 120, 128, 117 respectively. Upon receiving my results I was mostly just shocked - why is my iq so low? I started school after 2 years out (left in September 2020, mental health and family issues) so maybe that may have slightly affected it, but the increase would probably be so negligible it ultimately would’ve failed to change much.

"Hyperfocus and Hypersensitivities (Discussion) A common characteristic of many gifted individuals is their ability to maintain extreme focus on a subject, blocking outside stimuli, while also being able to redirect and refocus their attention on said subject after being distracted. While this is true for many, my experience has been one of seeing a great number of gifted people being annoyed and distracted even by the smallest sound. These people prefer working alone in complete silence and isolation.

Since hyperfocusing is a trait so universal among the gifted, that it is often used as part of their assessment, and due to the arguably small but gradually developing scientific literature on the subject, which reveals more and more discrepancies between theory and actual phenomena in the psychometrics field, I was wondering: in which category do you all fit?

I love her no matter what. And she is very skilled socially - she makes friends super easily everywhere she goes, and this will probably serve her well in life! But my same age nephew is gifted, and it’s just so fun to talk to him. 

Anyway just wondering peoples thoughts. 

If you don’t have kids, do you want your hypothetical future children to share this “trait” with you? 

If you do have kids - what has your experience been?",0

"What are the characteristics of being gifted? I’m curious to know what the qualities of an exceptionally intelligent person is. I am 16 years old and I’m insecure about my level of intelligence. In regards to academic performance, I have always excelled in honors and advanced courses. Outside of school, I built a wooden chassis from scratch of a 1930’s Mercedes Benz 540 roadster.

"I can’t learn anything unless I learn everything it involves, but no one person can explain every single thing about everything “it” involves…. I’ve been stuck for YEARS trying and failing to learn about computers and comp sci due to the fact that I just CANT get over the actual physics behind both modern and prehistoric computers; I always feel like I need to learn both quantum physics and comp sci/history all at once for any of it to make sense and it only serves to cripple me to the point of never completing even a single basic yt explanation video. I’d need 6 different top level experts in one room explaining all the aspects of every possible element involved with computers for it to ever truly make sense. 

Sure, I can accept and recite what I hear ppl say about computers, ram is short term memory,  cpu is the brain, etc. but what element of physics is even allowing any of this to happen at all? And how is it so precise? 

It does NOT help that I’m terrible at math :/


Don’t know if it matters but I’m not gifted, yet I’ve had this issue for as long as I can remember and NO ONE else seems to understand what I mean when I say I can’t just “learn” a new fact; I need to basically rediscover it myself, which I never do obviously, so I never learn anything.

But when Nature and Chance build you without the codes to connect to others - or maybe it's people that don't have them to connect to you ? - you end up walking the rooms, the hallways, the streets, apart from others. You live with this veil on you, heavy and smothering.

"How can I look “smarter”? A stupid but real question. Background: I’m mid-level software engineer currently interviewing for new roles.
I’m in possession of your typical gifted grab bag of traits - highly gifted, highly sensitive, highly anxious, etc. Personality-wise, if you’re familiar with MBTI, I come across as a cross between an INTP and an ENFP maybe? (INFJ is the closest fit) - cheery but hyper-nerd 3000x.

Those things on their own pose enough trouble as it is, but I’ve run into people who can’t seem to get past my appearance. It can be tough to pinpoint as it’s happening, but I’ve been told in interviews that I sound like I’m in marketing or product development (I don’t sound like an engineer - plausible, but I get my point across and it’s never effected me on the job). It also happens when I ask a straightforward question with a concrete answer, and get a response to a simpler, very basic question (anyone with a quarter of my experience would be able to answer), and a comment about how I should know the answer (to the simple question I didn’t ask, but do know the answer to). (Side note - sorry if that was too specific or rambling-last manager was hell). No problems with most engineers once on the job.

I’ve been told it’s in my head, but even at my last job, I’d have a staff engineer (most senior engineer) repeat my comments verbatim and get a valid response rather than a blank stare.
When some people project their imagined persona onto me, that persona is not smart or an engineer. It does not match reality, and it’s very frustrating for all involved. Other engineers were also confused.

In the words of my husband, I don’t look smart - I “look like I play a smart person on TV.” That’s with glasses. Without glasses, I normally look like a typical newscaster. I don’t wear much makeup or do anything to stand out really (unless I’m feeling a migraine coming on, in which case I look fabulous in big dark sunglasses and a baseball cap - my family members call it celeb incognito). I’m also pretty peppy and relatively fashionable. 

Outwardly: I come across as a cross between Meghan Markle and Kerry Washington, with a kindergarten teacher vibe that wants to explain logical fallacies to children (nicely), while feeding them tasty, vegan/allergen-friendly cookies for brain food (omega 3-6-9 acids balanced by need, of course).

Any tips? In my last role, I was basically told to be more assertive. Apparently, assertiveness fixes verbal comprehension. I don’t think that would work in an interview setting.",0
"How did you find out you were gifted? I considered having some kind of neurodivergency for the last couple of years and recently found out giftedness is one. Mental health professionals are out of reach for me so this is the best I have for my questions.
I really relate with some of the experiences of gifted people but for others I'm not sure how out of the normal I am (I've never had another brain to compare to) and I don't know how much personal agency I have on the diagnosis (obviously I'm not a professional so I can't be sure).
I read that giftedness is measured with an IQ score higher than 120, I took it and got 90, which would disqualify me. But yet again I'm not really sure of the process and how lax it is.
So I want to know how did you get diagnosed to figure some things out.",0

"What do you guys think about MBTI? I was fascinated by it in like 2013, and I made my friends take it. We had fun with it for a bit but eventually agreed it's nothing to be taken too seriously like most things that sort people into personality models.

Over the years it's amazed me how popular it's become, reading about companies that pay attention to your MBTI. Has anyone every experienced this? I think it's also funny that the INTP subreddit has more subs than most other MBTI types' subreddits when they're supposed to be the rarest lmao. I guess the tragedy of labels is very real. There's also the phenomenon of one being able to skew the outcome of tests like these if they know what they want to get, subconscious or not.

To me honestly, it's like astrology if you took psych 101. Yet, it is a little more based in logic IMHO. Sorry for any astrologists here, but, I'll never understand why people run when they find out my sign, or tell me I don't act like that sign if they get to know me.

"Our gifted kids podcast #60 - How to Tell Your Child They are Gifted w/ Dr Gail Post Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

This episode on OGK, Sophia chatted to Dr Gail Post about how to tell your child they are gifted and as parents, do we need to modify our expectations of our gifted kids?

&#x200B;

Here's a quote from Gail:  


> *“If you don’t someone else will, and someone else will put information in their head that maybe you’re not thrilled with or will overinflate the importance of it or confuse them. So, it’s up to us to explain it to them and what I think is really important to consider…is, you need to take into account their age, their maturity, their developmental level, because what you say to a five-year-old is different from a 10-year-old or a 15 year old.*  
>  
>*You have to think about what they can take in and really to talk to them about it as it’s no big deal, just be as matter of fact as possible because it’s just part of who they are.*  
>  
>*It’s not an accomplishment, they didn’t accomplish anything. It’s just who they are.*  
>  
>*And just letting them know it’s no different than your eye colour or your height. Or the fact that maybe you need glasses or the fact that you love peanut butter. I mean, these are all parts of who you are, and it’s really important just to be as matter of fact as possible.”* – Dr Gail Post

"where am I Hi. I recently noticed I maybe gifted. I have disguised my true self to be a normal person maybe because I'm highly senstive then uncontrollably vulnerable, but I belong nowhere.
I also noticed that I'm left handed but for about 29 years I had to change direction to fit myself in this right handers' society. In addition I understood that I had suffered from some kind of dyslexia and mental disorders like separation anxiety.
Nobody had found I caught in the horrible lies until my graduate school professor noticed. I made every effort to protect me and make friends, like remembering literally everything like a movie except words and symbols.

I tried to belong whatever community like asexual, lesbian, or very good students'. But every behavior was not for me and I could not be there. The reality just made me lonely.
I understand just now, why people are eager to find a job, make money, and get married. But I'm not sure a left handed, dyslexic, highly sensitive and at the same time too logical woman can be in the society.
I like philosophy, mathematics, computer science, physics, music, history, economics, excercise, language, art and so on, though I couldn't remember some words or symbols to master them beautifully.
I heard ""you may be good at whatever you do"" from professors but I don't know what to do.

I major in mathematics education because I love mathematics and humanity.
But my dyslexic pattern does matter whenever I take exams to be a math teacher, and I hate this country's education system which seems to make students do not love math or do math. Ironically I am the school hater.
I belong to not so-called friends community never getting me but some deep and sophisticated books or papers.
I understand whatever I do what matters is the people I get along with, but I do not have any friend who makes me naturally laugh, cry, or feel sth.

I, whose world just exploded, am happy to be myself but worried. I recently graduated and don't know where to go or what to do to get a job first.
Should I disguise me as a normal math teacher and understand the world of norm, to change the world though that gives me existential loneliness or emotional scar from the lifelong trauma?
Or should I go to gifted students' school to be in somewhat genuine relationships in my true self's safe zone? Maybe I mix the 'should' things to decide and thougts will change.
I needed to confess somewhere to respect my true self. Thanks for reading the first time as a maybe-gifted self.",0
"Paralysed by too many ideas and interests? Hey there,
I'm regularly having ideas about some new projects I want to go after. However, I'm often just brainstorming and excited but I rarely manage to actually put them into reality. That could be due to strong emotions that ascend when I get in a flow state of brainstorming. When I have that, I'm doing other activities where I can regulate my excitement by dancing, singing etc. (is this me stimming? And is this emotional and imaginational overexcitement according to Dabrowski's theory?).
Do you have any tips for me to actually go after those exciting ideas and not just thinking about them?

Edit: It's probably some kind of behavioral training needed to break the cycle, right?",0
"Therapist/counsellor recommendations in the UK Greetings from the UK!

I'm about to hit 30 and have been struggling with my mental health more than ever recently - this is mainly depression, but I have been anxious for as long as I can remember. I think the depression comes from a prolonged period of doing things I don't align with, for example, going through the traditional school system and then working in 9-5 jobs where I perform very well, but I am not stimulated and just feel like time is passing by and I'm wasting my 'gifts'. I've spent months on the dedicated mental health subreddits and have gone through CBT, but with little effectiveness. I stumbled across a post on one of these subreddits regarding giftedness and it dawned on me after years of trying to figure out why I'm constantly feeling this way (with a life-long drive for doing my own thing) that this is actually the underlying reason (I was in G&T cohorts at school and took cognitive tests to qualify).

Once I went down this path, it became apparent that (at least in the UK), there are not many psychologists/therapists that even list giftedness in their bio and they are all private (i.e. not via the NHS). I'm hesistant to spend money on someone I have googled with no reviews. **Does anybody have any personal recommendations for specialists in the UK who could hopefully delve into my brain and its thoughts?**

Thank you so much - one thing I have found is how little support there is for gifted adults once they are out in the world (beyond school, where it seems performance-driven rather than wellbeing-driven). I'm going to sit a Mensa entrance exam in the coming months in the hope that I will meet like-minded individuals to network with.",0
"savant syndrome/autism hey! this is my first post in here, so let me introduce myself. you can call me icarus, and I’m 18 and a sophomore in college. i am autistic, and have struggled a lot with school up until college, which is actually going quite well. my question-does anyone else have savant syndrome here? the doctors never said “you’re a savant”, but they did declare me as hyperlexic, which is a savant/splinter skill. i was wondering if there was anyone else who has this because often autistic spaces don’t necessarily have room for people on opposite ends of the spectrum in an attempt to cater towards more “average” or non gifted people, which is totally fine, but it make me feel just a little bit excluded.",0
"hi, friends what you guys opinions on space travel? Please, any serious and real discussion? Space and aliens are one of most curious topics for me...",0
"Giftedness, racing thoughts, and anxiety Hi. Does anybody else here struggle with extreme racing thoughts/anxiety? 

I have extreme anxiety ever since I was very little, part of which is due to racing thoughts, and I was formally diagnosed with giftedness at 8/9 yrs old - I'm 19 now. I suspect I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder but it's never really mattered to get diagnosed for it ig so I haven't a diagnosis for that

Anyways. For some reason, it only recently became evident to me that these two conditions might be related, to an extent. Now I don't have any studies to back up my claims, this is just from personal experience -- which is why I thought to ask you guys if you've ever struggled with anxiety related specifically to this:

So, one thing I've noticed over the years is my high intellectual excitability. Of course I always knew about it technically due to knowing I'm gifted, but as I grow older I truly realize what it means to need intellectual challenge - and what it means to find it.

Perhaps because of the fact everything seems easy or obvious, when I eventually find something that's new and challenging, it will make me electrified to a somewhat disturbing degree. Some people have told me what I feel is euphoria, but sometimes it feels too intense and frequent to even qualify.

One common example is when I am learning a new subject that happens to capture my attention. Reading new information and contemplating thoughts and ideas that I've never had before - this makes me *hyper*. My mind will start jumping around as if my brain is mixing what I know with what I've learned, right then and there. This makes my head race. My heart starts thumping and my chest hurts, sometimes I get nauseous - that part's the severe anxiety, I guess. It causes my pain sometimes, if my anxiety meds are not in check and stuff; in the past its made me turn away from studying because of the physical symptoms.

Well, from what I gather, making connections faster, getting brain activity so high when learning and thinking -- that's typical giftedness, right? So I thought, hey, maybe all gifted people struggle with racing thoughts and some degree of anxiety because of this?

I tagged this as personal because it got a little personal, but I wanted to raise this as a topic of discussion. Is this a thing? What are you guys' experience regarding this? Do you have anxiety too? Racing thoughts? If you don't, what is it like to be gifted & not anxious lol? I can't imagine not feeling this way, so I'd like to know it out, of pure curiosity.",0
"Masks and bags, and the struggles they provide. This is my first post ever on reddit and I'm scared as hell. I've commented a few times on different subs, but I enjoy observing and learning through other people's experiences and opinions.

Recently, my world was turned upside down due to some unfortunate circumstances. It's made me think about how other people view me and how I've changed alongside the changes in my life, such as meeting my wife, having children and living in a couple of different countries and cultures.

I found this subreddit after I was diagnosed 2E, highly gifted/ADHD. When reading studies about my diagnosis, the word that kept coming up was ""masking"". In this case it's the one exceptionality masking the other but I've seen many of you refer to this in another sense, as well. As in the mask that we put on to hide our true self.This is something that resonated with me very much and has been a catalyst for my ""philosophical journey"" since my diagnosis.

I identified my mask(s) quite early in life, my mother being an amateur actress likely helped with that. However, what others call masking, I call adapting. My mother would often say that the best actors do not act like their characters, they *are* them. So growing up I, almost automatically, *was* different versions of ""me"" based on who I was with or what I was doing. This was even somewhat comforting, as the true me and my needs never really got prioritized enough to get in the way of my interactions with others. I was the definition of a people pleaser.This did however take it's toll on me as I grew older. How would I choose paths in life that were completely independent of others when I hadn't really ever explored my own identity?

As gifted individuals, varying of course with the severity of our ""gift"", we are by definition separated from the norm. Myself, as what I now understand to be highly gifted, apparently have something like a 1/1000 chance of interacting with someone of my cognitive abilities. I am fortunate to have one friend like that and while we are about as different as two individuals can be in regards to interests etc., the feeling of not having to adapt, of being understood and trusting that he'll make the connections is something I never thought could exist. Our relationship has humbled me and made me a person that no longer blames society for not adjusting to me but rather enjoys learning about, and calibrating, the levels of adaptation required of me in said society.

My point with all of this is that yes, we do likely all mask our gift in one way or another. Weather it be that we dumb down our interactions with others, self medicate with drugs, alcohol, sex or games or hide behind our anger as we curse the skies for the knowledge we are burdened with.However, in order to contextualize what I see as the cause of these struggles, I would like to invite you to my world of duffel bags.

Imagine if the world would revolve around how many duffel bags people could carry and the norm was to have two hands. Having ten, or twenty hands would give you an obvious advantage. Social norms in this world however, say that the optimal amount of bags to carry is three. Carrying more that that is just showing off, while just carrying two or less means that you're not trying hard enough. With our ten or twenty hands, carrying three is mind numbingly boring, it's never a challenge. We look for the situations in life that require more bags to be carried, for our empty hands are deteriorating. If only it would be that lending a hand to others with fewer hands or sometimes even carrying all of their bags was seen as not only a way of bridging the gap between us, but also a way for us to handle our own struggles.

Meeting other people with ten or twenty hands makes us feel ""normal"" in this world of two-handers. We envy the two-handers and wish we were them just as much as they wish they were us. We are different, and we are necessary but that does not make us special or more valuable. We just provide something else. 

I make this post as a person who used to hate myself so much for not fitting in, but when my world fell apart, I finally realized that maybe I did fit in. Cause I had 20 hands that were ready to start building my world back together again.

"A glimpse of a future that could be: Relationships - masks - addictions. How I survived. TLDR: My former wife and my IQs were over 50pts apart. It ended badly.

I was in my early 20s. I had already survived the elementary school mocking, the high school rebelling due to boredom, the first 2 years of college freedom and failures and I was ready for something new to try and fail at. LOL, in my eyes at the time what I was missing is the “social experience” that my peers had. So working a mind-numbing warehouse job, working out, and drinking myself stupid so I could fit in with my “peers”. It was a dream come true. No one expected anything from me.

Then I met her. A girl who saw my potential. We clicked over stupid stories, music and a similar background (both of us half breeds). Everything was roses. I started drinking less and sorting myself out, she started seeing me as someone who could be trusted and go to for advice. Then I met her family and things took a stranger dynamic… they found out I could “see” situations differently, like interactions with corporations, hospitals, social dynamics and apply things I saw and read to help them focus on decisions that would make their lives better. I became a muse for their whole family.

It was glorious being needed. It felt good to be in my 20s and having 50-60yr old “successful” people asking me advice like I was some seer. The family kept pushing my GF at the time and I to start talking about marriage. So we did… and we ran off (putting the family in the position of paying for a ceremony was ludicrous in my eyes).

Fast forward 9 years. I had been clean and only social drank. I completed a degree, landed a very good position as an assistant director in a government agency. Then the bomb dropped (the reason I brought up this story).

You see, my wife had an IQ of 90ish. She was a very pleasant person, salt of the earth type kindergarten teacher.  Her ideas were never revolutionary and she never really could keep up with any conversational topics of the entertaining “what ifs”. It never bothered me really; I would just mask up when speaking to her. She would call me a “nerd” or a “geek” when I would start a conversation about Roman society and its relevance to modern day technology, or the similarities between DNA and assembly language 8-bit coding. It all happened when she saw my resume.

Apparently, she went to update her resume for her biography at her job. IT was half a page long and she was upset because mine was over two pages and she felt inadequate. It was then I realized that my giftedness had afforded me opportunities that the synchronous folks don’t get (unless connected or wealthy).

She upped and joined the Navy the next week. Sailed off in a month and we divorced 6 months later. It was a blur. She ran from being around me, cut all ties and dropped 9 years of a relationship off in the trash.  She finally told me that I was a constant reminder of what she could never do.  Welcome to the first REAL failure of being gifted- inability to retain relationships due to the disparity of potential- whether that manifests itself as dependency, fear, jealousy… it’s a real thing.

(Don’t worry things get MUCH better in life! I got oodles of more gifted stories about work promotions, military life, med school, married to a gifted woman, having gifted kids, raising non gifted and gifted kid… so much fun)",0
"Is it odd if I do have friends? I don't mean this in a way that implies that I shouldn't be able to have social skills just because I'm gifted. I'm wondering if it's wrong if I mask to have those relations. When I hang out with friends my mind calms down and I don't overthink, I actually enjoy going out with friends. But I can't form real connections with them, I can't talk to them about very important things to me like my life goals or  struggles with my sexuality. It's all laughs, which isn't bad but I'm not having the connections that I would want to have with them.   
It's not that I don't like them or anything, I really appreciate their friendship, I know that I can rely on them, they tell me things about them. But I can't open to them because (this might sound bad) I tend to act dumb around them, not in a sense that I am too smart for them, but I try not to think to much to fit in the group.  
Since I knew that I was gifted (1 year ago), I've come to realize that I mask around people a lot and that I've been doing it almost my whole life, it's something I started to do in middle school.

"Struggling with the social life So I don’t know if it is the right place to talk about this but after reading posts, I am curious if people can relate to my story. 

I have been alone (not having close friends) and struggled with having a social life since I was little. I recently realized the friends I used to hang with aren’t really my type of people. They drained my energy and also made me feel even more alone. 

Due to the lack of social life I’ve always felt anxiety. Last spring I was almost burning myself out because I tried to manage my anxiety with school work. 

I went to a school counselor and a psychologist who suspected I could be gifted or maybe have autism. 

School has never been difficult for me and I’ve always been told I’m really curious and open minded.

I've chosen the standard physics course, which takes into account three years for getting a decree - yet I still know very small about how universities work - and other additional two years for getting a master's decree etc..
Don't know if it is too much for me, but guess what, I'm trying to figure it out on my own, given that I don't know how-in-the-world to get a glimpse of it the best I can!
Though, I have to say, I've always been passionate about learning stuff and feeling a newborn learner, who has to learn even more - and it doesn't end ever.
I remember that some days my dad was off work, we could spare some time to get to watch documentaries on TV (the ""Focus"" channel/programme) about space, nature and science.
Can't hide it, I was invested and thrilled in all of it!
I felt like the world was all in my hands, being capable of forging it into a new shape.


But as the days, years went by, I lost touch with this feeling of ""control"". Actually, six years from the tragic and unexpected (at the time) car accident-death of my father in December 2016, I began struggling with this thing I always kept feeling inside of me, even though it was not of the type and the intensity I perceived it all the time before that fatal day of my, and my family's, lives.
It was gradually proceeding to take control over my life, this sense of mediocrity, inferiority, absent self-worth, guilt, and incomprehension.

But some random days it would not be that painful that it'd been all throughout these 5-6 years of severe existential depression, real low self-esteem, severe social anxiety and lost of touch with reality.
As I grew older however, one thing remainded persistent:  the way life shaped to be from that day onward and the mentality&mindset it brought to life as for me.
However painful, ugly, terribly put it may be, I developed - and still am to this day, even after having been diagnosed additionally with delusional psychosis - this sense of reason to explain to myself all the pain I felt all the way through, beginning from changing perspective over things/ideologies more specifically (first I was an atheist, then an agnostic ""believer"", then a sort of a Buddhist thingo believer, then a nihilist, a naturalist, an optimistic nihilist and now what?!) to drastically carrying those shifts in perspective to reality, as an attempt to achieve better life results, tho still keeping struggling to portray any lesser achievement as MY work, and the result of MY  persistence in living...

I am still nowadays too fragile as I could see even the tiniest of one bite, rip apart the soul out of me [metaphore?].
I keep changing view on things all days, I have from time to time mental breakdowns, and suicide instincts that deflect me from doing remarkable things for the little I can do.
Even after all the coping I've tried to do, for the grief and all, and even after being from now 4-5 years under psychological and psychiatric (the antidepressants and else..) treatment. Despite all of this, I have yet to discover a way to fulfill my potential or a way to make myself someone who's better.


(P.s, I may also have something related to borderline personality disorder...).




So, after you've witnessed and read all of this (I suppose), would you be willing to read even further to get an idea of how my thoughts reflect onto my mental stability?
..if this is normal, am not sure. I've come to a few conclusions that I've seen that stay the most over the years as I continue to grow older each on of them. And I'm here to share them with you.
Please take this as an act of courage, of help seeking attention, because this simply means a lot to me; it is very difficult to spread these words out as I cry inside and (I) don't even notice. Thanks.

I come from a very (Catholic-)Christian family.
My grandma the most (-christian).
I have been baptized and have undergone the common ceremonies that a fellow christian family's kid is subject to.
Still, as of now, I can't say any more than this that I'm one of the most skeptical about Christianity (and religion overall) than I've ever been.
I've always been attracted onto discovering things on my own, the surprise of it(!), and questioning everything I could!!

But things weren't meant to be coherent and complementary, as I turned out to think.
The one was meant to oppose the other - tho I have to admit that little to almost no information I have gained/researched over the course of my life in attempt to make a better understanding of it all.


Why was I so involved in religion and science at such a young age?
In my case, it is not a matter of IQ, but rather the feeling of feeling the purest emotions out there.
I remember little, but as for now, what stands out for me is the cruelty of this world.
Add onto it the trigger of a mental health issue big as a mountain, and Ta-Da! You have my perspective (I guess)!
So that's right; it was a way to provide myself better methods to cope with the harsh reality of this world.

I know this world is not all rotten, and that the major traumas that happen in one's life are specific to social interactions or to the social nature of humankind. A-part from the spontaneous physical illnesses that may arise from nothing - all my respect towards those who are suffering - I've seen it all from a social perspective.

Just. Love ain't for me. Or at least not to this day.
My family is at a precarious state of carrying on on life, both economically and emotionally speaking. We are devastated from a State that does care nothing about us, or I should say, those who go under his name. My mother is an all-do for all day long kind of worker. She breaks in halves to make us BREATH FRESH AIR, and yet she is so deeply broken inside that I've got the feeling that she could vanish from one day to another given how she's staying alive these days. COVID-19 hasn't helped obviously. Neither having my family split in two, 'cause of my mother's ""new"" partner.
And given mental illnesses we all deal with in my family, in different shapes and colours, it will take not much longer for me to self-destroy.

All I cared was for a father figure to guide me through the race; for love to wake me up and let me scream ""I love you world!""; But instead all I got, was pain, other's vengeance for little mistakes I've done in the past, betrayal from friends and solitude. Lots and lots of solitude.

I am at the point of which I currently - please, believe me - have no real values and I panic too easily in front of difficulties.



The way society portrays it all; from the beauty of having it all good, beautiful, rich and charismatic; to the way everybody points onto someone else who has done a mistake and thinks of punishment as the best option for letting someone understand (rather feel pain, excluded), instead of permitting one's self rehabilitation.
Wars all ahead, if not globally, from minorities' points of view. The fight for rights, who desperately tries to make it out forever, and instead can't stand a chance against the sands of time, having gotten a centuries and all the world has changed.
Animals, predators and preys.
It's all too much",0
"Is it bad that I just want to be average? I’m about to start my junior year of high school. It’s a brand new school(Just built from scratch this year) and doesn’t have any AP or honors courses. It’s a technology and innovation based school, so along with a high school diploma, you can graduate with certifications for some trades. You can learn things like programming, crime scene investigation, piloting, programming, carpentry, and a lot more. I’m going to be focusing on programming. I love programming and I’m super excited to go to a school that really focuses on it, but my parents are worried I won’t be challenged or won’t feel fulfilled without taking AP and honors classes. 

I’ve been considered gifted all my life and have always been in gifted programs and advanced classes. I almost skipped a grade but due to my social anxiety, I wasn’t emotionally ready for that. I really struggle with mental illness, especially anxiety. I’ve been a perfectionist since kindergarten and always got amazing grades. Now that I’m in high school, the pressure for good grades is even higher. My parents don’t encourage good grades, they just expect me to get good grades. When I express my concerns about getting bad grades, they say things like “You’ll do great, we know you’ll get good grades! You always do.” It just makes me feel more anxious. 

I also have social anxiety, which makes socializing in school extremely difficult. I tried cyber school last year and it was horrible for my mental health. My depression was terrible and it’d cause me to put off work for weeks, then my anxiety and perfectionism would kick in and I’d do all of the work at once. I managed to finish the year with all As but it was very stressful for me. 

Is it bad that I wish I weren’t gifted? I want to be able to get average grades and be an average person and not have people thinking I’m not living up to my potential or whatever. Honestly I want to focus on my mental health and not my grades. I don’t want to fail all my classes of course, but I don’t want to feel like I absolutely must get 100% on every assignment and test. Plus I mean, is any of it really going to matter in the future? I have no clue what profession I want to go into. I’m simply learning programming because I enjoy it. I’m currently working as a cashier at a craft store and sell crochet items on the side. Honestly I don’t think I’d mind doing that for the rest of my life, maybe become a manager at the store. I just want to be a normal person. Not a brain surgeon or NASA scientist or mathematician or any other “smart people jobs.” Sorry if those examples are offensive, they’re just the ones my parents constantly use to express my “gifted potential.” But so what if I work in retail for the rest of my life? I enjoy it and I make enough money to live. My giftedness doesn’t mean I need to be super duper successful. 

Does anyone else feel like this? A lot of people in this sub are adults so I guess I should be asking did any of you feel like this when you were in high school? Does it get any better once you’re out of the school setting? What types of jobs do you guys have? Also sorry for the ridiculously long post!

"Verbally gifted child that did not qualify for GT program My 6 yo is verbally gifted but did not qualify for GT program when tested at school last year. They gave her an achievement test and she was in 98th percentile for reading and 78th percentile for math. She met criteria for reading but not math. They did not do an IQ test. The school recommended she be tested again this year. 

We had her tested privately because we noticed some anxiety about things children her age usually don’t think about. She still has some anxiety but it’s manageable and she’s doing ok socially. They gave her the wppsi but that was a couple years ago. She had the following standard scores on the wppsi: verbal comp 135; visual spatial 115; working memory 124; full scale IQ 130.

I’m at a loss. Should I have her tested again? Does she even need a gifted program since she is not gifted in all areas? She’s in a high preforming district but does complain about the class work being boring or too easy. She asks me when they are going to move on and learn new things. Will it be stressful to be in a GT program with kids who are more highly gifted? I feel like she’s in a weird in between space.",0
"Giftedness Misdiagnosed as Autism? I had a psych eval recently.  The results came back last week as: no ADHD, anxiety or depression, but a diagnosis of autism/Asperger’s.  

The problem I’m having is the report mainly focuses on my lack of personalized small talk with the assessor.  He said I was very “clinical” and anything I said was in response to prompts.  And I’m like, I thought that was the point of the test?  In school or at home I would have been told off for being off topic?  

Lots of people don’t like small talk, especially in the gifted population.  I was focused on the testing tasks, which I blew through in half the allotted time.  I’m also very reserved and I feel like talking about personal matters in person is something of an intrusion, especially with a stranger.  By this criteria, anyone who’s reserved, task-oriented and focused could have autism.  

I would have been ok if the doctor mentioned repetitiveness, preference for routines, literal thinking, focus on detail or anything more obvious and scientific.  

Has anyone seen giftedness misdiagnosed as autism in their lives or read about such a phenomenon?",0
"I have a tendency to ""people please"" because the people who relate to me are so rare and I don't find them easily A post about adult relationships.

I'm a musician and an astronomy student, and I played a lot of classical stuff as a kid. A lot of my interests are quite niche and it's rare to find people who will speak about them. 

This may sound paradoxical, but... whenever I do find ""one of my tribe"" I ironically don't feel like I can be ""myself"" around them whatever that means, because I also feel like I have an obligation to keep that person together since if it falls apart it's gonna be a while before I find the next one. 

If it's just a casual short conversation with people, I have no problem with that because I don't have to invest into the relationship.

The only discrepancy was the verbal, which I scored 130 in. The rest were 108 and 109 pretty much.

"Impostor Syndrome Hello,

I have a problem with being maybe higly gifted/expectionnally gifted/profoundaly gifted (+143-193) and expectation of other people.

I need to given some context of my """"""""IQ test"""""""", I m born disabled because I m born too soon at five month + I have dysgraphia  and maybe (many thing that) dyspraxia

i have no balance and I m in wheelchair

at my 16 years old, I did a surgery due to my disability, it has create many problem and lot of pain .I stayed 11 month at the hospital instead of 4 month.

My surgeon throught, I act ""weird"" for teenager ( act too much like a adult, he was thinking ) and he asked a psychologist to given me a  psychological assessment (mental heath and iq) also due of the pain of surgery

I was diagnostic with PTSD, my psychologist due to PTSD think IQ test was useless but thinking I m somewhere between 143-193 in  first time and 150-170 on second time...

I saw my psychologist during 2-3 month at a regular basis 2 time per week.

But I doesn't see where she saw that...

I doesn't do anything WoW when I was young or particular thing. 0 early sign... like higly gifted (speak at soon after born or learn to read alone)

The only sign of giftness was i m VEEEEEEEEEEERY Curious and I steal book (like encyclopedia, stuff of science or history)  of my brother when he was in high school when  I had 6-8 years old

I dont see me at someone ""Higly Gifted""

I find it is hard to accept my giftness, I see me like a impostor

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And the second problem, It is the expectation of my Friend and my family

My Family see like a genious and have high Expecation for my futur

Even my surgeon who are a good friend now, he has about me high expectation, He said to me ""If you go in medecine and your not in first place of your entrance exam, you will dissapoint me"" and other friend of university who are also gifted,  it is the same.

I have Very Expectation about myself and  it's not a hassle but Expectation of other people  stress me out a lot + I  see myself like sh\*t because i dont cross Expectation of my close family and friend  and I dont know, how to deal with that

"I am overly anxious about my future I (20F) study at one of the world's top universities. My whole life people told me that I was intelligent and gifted. This was till I started high school. I got the highest score in my country's national high school entrance exam. During my high school years, I had severe problems at home that I really don't want to talk about. That was the time I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression. After that, I became just an above-average student. I was trying so hard but not using my full potential due to my mental issues. I graduated with an above-average score but I could have done it better I just knew it.

Everyone expects highly intelligent people to study degrees like law, engineering, med, etc. Since my childhood, I knew the areas that intrigued me and I was passionate about. Therefore, I chose to study Media (AR/ VR Design). I relied too much on academic validation, and now the degree that I study is not validating me academically. I feel hopeless and worthless.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy what I study, and I'm doing great. I still feel like my skillset is perfect for my degree that's why I stand up. But at the same time, I can't stop myself from questioning what I am doing with my future. I feel like everyone's so ahead of their game. I have been taking on more responsibilities than I can afford time-wise. Overworking myself because I don't feel enough. Everyone says as long as you are doing what you love, you will succeed because it will not feel like work to you. It really doesn't feel like work but is it because it is just not smart people's degree or because I am good at it?

I am surrounded by very smart people. Not in my course but in my uni and friend group in general and I think I am just a wasted potential who could have studied law or medicine. What if I don't ever be successful in my career? I am an international student and I worry about not being able to make enough money in the future to make the investment my family made for me to get this education. I am a disgrace.",0
"I can barely cope with time. I need some advice Maybe this discussion would have been better suited to happen on discord, but since the server is gone, I will post the whole thing here.

&#x200B;

To give some background, I am a 27M and I have been officially diagnosed gifted about two months ago. I am waiting to do more tests with a neurologist since she believes I may have ADHD on top of the other curse. I have also been going to therapy for half a year by now. English is not my first language and I tend to be fairly chaotic when writing texts like this one, now add dyslexia to the whole thing, and behold the incoming Crawling Chaos. I am sorry about it, but cannot ask somebody to review this text it for me to tell me if it makes any sense, hence this will have to do.

&#x200B;

While I have a hard time dealing with hypersensitivity, powering off my brain, and a bunch of other things, reality, truth and time are the things that I have the most issues with, at least I noticed lately.

&#x200B;

I would rather avoid talking about concepts of existence, truth and reality. It usually makes me uncomfortable to talk about it due to feeling like a fool, a madman or as having a strong mental disorder. However it could be deeply linked to my issue about time. Hence I'm still vaguely putting the topic in the post this way, just in case, uncomfortably. It may be relevant ..?

&#x200B;

I have no clue as to what is real and is not. I clearly remind that since I am 7 I am wondering as to why I am alive, why am I in my head, what is in the head of others. Is it an existential crisis ? It may be

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now about time itself. I feel insanely overwhelmed by time. I will put in bullet points anything that I have noticed as of late that I can recall about my strange relationship to time :

&#x200B;

\- I can not be bothered to sleep all the hours that I need to feel rested. I feel like it is a waste of time, as eating is some days. Even other basics needs often feel like a waste of time compared to whatever I am doing on that very moment. Most of the time that very moment is learning new things or channeling my mind through video games, or doing both at the same time

\- I feel overwhelmed to even talk about time with people. I always feel uncomfortable to talk about my past or my future.

\- I am always thinking about whatever I will be doing next rather than whatever I am doing at the moment. I feel blind to the present.

\- I feel like that I am always out of time, hence do not even bother to start things that I want to do, or need to do.

\- Work-wise, I never have any clue how much time I will need to do something. That makes me scared and usually procrastinate.

\- I may even be scared of the passing time, I do not know how and why.

&#x200B;

These are the only things that comes to my mind as of now, but I believe that this would be enough to maybe allow some of you to point me out where I am supposed to go from now on, or how to direct my thoughts.

&#x200B;

All these things may also be related to the fact that I am scared to die without leaving anything to the world positive. It could also be linked to a very low esteem of myself (at least this is what the psychologist says), but as of now I have no clue. I am lost. Truth be told, I have never been this lost. Any help, in any form, would be truly appreciated.",0
"Why can gifted people be so nice but also so mean? I see that giftedness and empathy are related in a way. Gifted people tend to have strong sense of morality and proper conduct.

But also, in the comments section and real life, I see gifted or just smart people being so mean for no reason.

I put just smart there because I think there might be a difference between gifted and smart. Meaning, someone can score an IQ of 115 and be gifted while another can 115 and not be gifted. So maybe that has something to do with it.",0

People shouldn’t be mad at someone who’s gifted I don’t understand why non gifted people hold such high standards for gifted individuals. Yet when we meet these standards we can’t be proud of ourself once we meet the expectation. The most recent memory of this was when I put on my story that I got good grades on a state test then someone texted me saying that I shouldn’t post that because there’s dumb people like her and that makes them feel bad. And it’s not even like they try to get a good grades and improve the whole time they talk and whatever during class yet are shocked when they see their grades. They don’t want me to “show off” my smarts yet want me help. It’s so frustrating.,0

I had domestic abuse in the past and my ex-partner wanted me to be less successful and had issues with women being more intelligent than him. Later on, I had therapy, but quite often therapists need their clients to be inferior to them too. My issues got worse and worse over time. Please don't recomment another therapist, that topic is dead for me; I joined reddit for the Antipsychiatry subreddit initially.

In my experience therapist can't cope with giftedness - their usual belief is that everyone is putting themselves under too much stress in order to achieve more, not less, and they were unable to understand that I often feel blocked by my inner voices and strengthened the masking.",0

Bonjour tout le monde,

Au vu d'un sondage récent, je me demandais si les personnes francophones ici seraient intéressées par la création d'un sub francophone consacré à la douance et tout ce qui s'y rapporte. L'objectif serait de profiter du fonctionnement de Reddit pour créer un espace de discussion sur ces sujets ouvert à tout le monde et où il serait plus ou moins facile de s'y retrouver.

L'idée serait concrètement serait de pouvoir discuter de notre petite différence et de ses impacts possibles sur nos vies en français et, si l'envie s'y prête ou l'occasion se présente, de poser des questions sur le sujet. Cependant, cela pourrait aussi être l'occasion de profiter de la fonction Wiki de Reddit pour recenser sous une forme facilement accessible les sources francophones crédibles sur le sujet afin de pouvoir à notre échelle assainir le débat (surtout quand on voit à quel point les neuromythes foisonnent en France.)

Evidemment, rien n'est encore fait concrètement mais si vous êtes motivé pour aider à mettre ce projet sur pied, n'hésitez pas à vous signaler.

Tl;dr in English: I've got the idea to create a giftedness-related sub in French. But people who speak French without living in a French-speaking country are welcome if they want to practice French on a topic they're interested in or if they want to discover our oh-so-marvelous particularities regarding giftedness (but then please take a step back on this precise topic, as we're talking about pseudoscientific stuff)

"I become severely unhinged when I'm not good at new things .6 seconds after learning about them. I just started a new administrative position for which nobody trained me, and I feel so lost and behind and overwhelmed and like a huge drag when I have to ask questions. A task that I feel should take 15 minutes can take me 45 to an hour just because I'm so reluctant to ask for help because I feel like I should already *know how* to do it all simply because I'm a boss. I know logically it's not my fault; this is going as it should, on-the-job training. But the notion that I am not yet entirely competent in all the skills involved in this position and I cannot handle everything all on my own absolutely SENDS ME. The stress is exhausting and is really making me hate this job and question every step I've taken to get here. I just want to go live in the woods and have a huge garden and solar panels and live sustainably and never talk to another person ever again.

I also feel like this deeply irrational disappointment in myself when I don't instantaneously become amazing at new things is why I don't do new things, especially not with or in front of others. I can't tolerate my own failure, let alone allow someone else to see it happen. It's excruciating.

My therapist pointed out I have control issues, and this job has made it glaringly and debilitatingly obvious. It's not that I want to control what others do, but I want to be able to control the quality (seamlessness) of the outcomes. This leads me to crave control over every little thing, and the higher up I go in boss-land, the more I realize I do not have control. Not at all. I have to trust every fucking day that things will just...work out. And it's even more terrifying now that I can hardly trust my own self to do the job right and well because nobody has taught me ALL the skills I need to know, and I have to rely so heavily on other people to do their jobs right so that I can do mine.

"Struggling with finding places to rent as an underage college student. Hello everyone. I skipped a year ahead at school, so now I'm 16 and a fresh graduate from high school. I live in a rural place, so I must move out in order to go to university. I applied to on-campus housing and am currently on a waitlist, and I'm struggling a lot to find places that will take me in while underage.

Most ""find a roommate"" services don't allow underage people to register. I can't book a hostel because I'm underage. There are very few off-campus student dorms that will take me in and they are way out of my budget.

I am wondering if there is a service to help gifted students find housing to be able to study at university. I've heard stories of people not being able to attend their chosen colleges because no accommodation would take them because of their age. Does anyone know anything?

By the way, I would like to move to somewhere in County Dublin, or within a reasonable commuting distance.",0

"What does high empathy have to do with giftedness? I would definitely say I have really high empathy towards people (most of the time), but I'm usually the slowest, if not average in my class.

"Why do I feel anxiety when I do not do anything? Sometimes, I am so tired that I just want to lay in bed but seek stimulation but too tired to do something more “productive” like watch tv or listen to a podcast so I scroll social media passively but i find this makes me quite anxious, does this happen to you? Do you know why? 

One of my theory is that i often try to optimize my fun times to make it useful or do activities like go for a hike where i get like a nice memory and that perhaps i feel anxious because social media scrolling gives me very little value but allows me to pass time passively. 

Or another theory I have is that perhaps social media is just too stimulating for the mind and that causes anxiety. 

Being on reddit and reading gifted post is fine but being on reddit and randomly scrolling thru feed gives me anxiety.  

I suppose the obvious solution is to find more activities but sometimes i just feel exhausted. 

Any thoughts?",0
"Does anyone else have a really claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in time and space? First of all, sorry if this post is kind of chaotic/jumbled, but if I'd try to bring a better flow into it and connect it all better it'd quickly end up as a complete book combining my entire autography with philosophical ramblings on literally everything on earth, so I'll leave it in some kind of loosely connected bullet point format and it already feels too long like this. I'm wondering whether any other gifted people feel similar because it feels very connected to overexcitabilities, a certain ""wide/global"" way of thinking etc.

\- I have all kinds of anxieties connected to the passing of time, decay, etc. Death anxiety, gerascophobia (fear of aging), health anxiety, probably some chronophobia in itself.

\- Obviously you can't travel through time, and time is limited. You can travel through space, but as it costs time (time itself + money, which is gained through spending time) it is limited, too. Sign of emotional overexcitability: ""They show strong emotional attachments to people, places, and things"". Sign of giftedness: Excessive curiosity. I want to discover so much of the world, and I get deeply attached so easily. The limits of space and time don't allow me to honor this. I don't even dare to do or discover anything anymore. I miss people and places so strongly. It's also hard that the passing of time makes me excessively scared of people passing away. And what about appreciating all the people and things who existed before me, existed after me? I'd like to appreciate everything! Maybe there's some soulmates there!

\- Time doesn't wait for you. So many things I can't experience and it's a waste. I hate wasted potential. Worst of all, I've never had a relationship. Not because of the standard reasons people never had one, but because I really need to feel strongly. I know I can. I get attached easily, but I've only felt this strongly for one (for 5 years now), but it's impossible because it'd never be the right place and time for it. I feel it's a waste of my youth, my life, and most of all of this gift of being able to feel so strongly. Also people getting married feels horrible, because I'm so many stages behind them. As I've spent my entire school life since starting elementary school with kids several years older than me, being ""behind"" and ""skipping"" things socially has caused me a lot of pain all my life, and this people my age getting married thing while I'm like this... feels even worse.

\- I just mentioned, ""right place and time"". You're so limited by this. There's been so much potential wasted in the world because of people not being at the right place and right time for them. Meanwhile I'm jealous that some people just seem to be born into a place and time that seems fit them so well. You can't control time, meanwhile controlling the place has limits & you never really know which place could be the right one beforehand.

\- Time and space make me feel like I'm digging through a narrow, dark tunnel. Any advice anyone ever gives basically sounds like ""Well, dig in another direction"". I could dig in another direction but I'd still be in a narrow tunnel. I'm tired of digging at all.

\- I'm wondering what's the meaning in all this. If there's nothing beyond this reality, it feels all meaningless. NDEs etc., while I'm not 100% convinced of them, intrigue me because there's certain aspects often mentioned about them that seem to fit so well with my feelings. It's said time and space don't really exist there, and the way time and space function here feels really unnatural to me, like I'm actually from a world with completely different physical laws. Take dreams for example - not 100%, but just as an approximation, that ""fluidity"" of time and space in dreams already feels a lot more ""natural"" to me than the rigidity and stiffness of time and space as experienced in the ""real"" world. NDEs also often talk of more intense, more all-encompassing feelings and perceptions which sounds a lot like my intensities/overexcitabilities to me.",0

"NO idea why i'm here We've always suspected our 11-year old daughter was gifted. Just not normal knowledge retention and comprehension from the moment she was born. Like, doing 36 piece puzzles as a baby-kinda stuff. Every medical professional has told us she's not 'average"", whatever that is. She was reading Harry Potter with full comprehension at 6. (don't judge, lol) I'm a writer, my wife is a teacher. Her vocab is off the charts. Getting her tested, as you can imagine, has been difficult the past few years bc the medical community has been tied up with more important things. Part of the process is talking to the parents. And all signs are pointing to me being the source of her ""giftedness."" So the more i read about it, the more I agree. And I'll be honest, it's fuckin' with my head a bit. If i had known this sooner my life could have been so much smoother. (maybe?) So many issues are tied to being gifted. Has anyone else experienced this? Am I being a whiny little bitch?

"Hyper-observance, relationships and obsession/anxiety. Yeah, anyone else struggle with this in any way? 

I’m hyper observant — meaning the moment someone seems to change mood/interest level/communication/lies…I feel it immediately. It’s like I can’t turn off that pattern analysis part of my brain, and my anxiety goes through the roof with my intuition screaming at me that something is wrong. 

I then obsess about it non-stop. Why? What do I do? Will they respond? Are they lying to me about this? Hiding how they really feel? Sometimes that bubbles over into me asking them questions. But the answers don’t really help unless the vibes I’m getting from their actions change. 

A lot of times it’s an overreaction. But no one else seems to get it, what it feels like to be SO sensitive to everything my significant other is putting out energy-wise. And then of course there are the times that I’m right…which is realistically fairly often. 

Gah. I’m really struggling with this!",0

"DAE have an exceptionally hard time with dating and relationships? My brain loves finding patterns, and I’m very sensitive to emotional shifts within other people. Because of this, I can usually feel when a relationship is winding down — like, when the other person has checked out and is yet to let me know. 

This happens over and over. In my marriage, my ex pulled away from me and after we’d been divorced over a year, he told me the exact time when the emotional shift happened and he checked out. It coincided with when my brain initially picked up on the shift. Currently, I’m dating someone and a month ago the same shift happened. I’ve been internally gaslighting myself because I asked whether he wants to continue seeing me and he insists he does. My rule is I only ask once and then trust the answer, as it becomes pathetic to ask multiple times. Again my brain is measuring behind the scenes and telling me he’s checked out.

"How did you find your profession? Hi! During therapy for various reasons, the most impactful beeing emotional neglect during childhood (enough to be diagnosed with cptsd, but i am on a good way), I discovered giftedness and could relate to it. Did the Mensa test and now it's official that I am gifted...

I am currently doing my PhD in Engineering...but as I resolve my childhood traumas and go through multiple steps of positive desintegration, I disvcover that this doesnt suit me anymore. The thing is: with my hobbies it was allways that i dive super deep into something, I am interested for that for a time, but after at the most 2-3 years I am on an really high level of knowledge there and then it gets boring. I simply love to discover new things. But doing things over and over is torture for me (and my job has reached this level).

Doing theraphy (and for me it definitly is Auto-Psychotheraphy as dabrowski calls it), showed me how good I am with this, how I have a really deep understanding of it (just as with everything I am interested in) and how I would love to transform all the pain I went through in my life to help other people. The thing is....I am afraid. Afraid that after 5 years of learning I will again have lost my drive in that direction, as with my masters degree....

"I'm not an introvert; most social interaction is just so lame that it exhausts me. I've struggled with this concept of being an introvert or an extrovert. As my interest in social interaction and playing the ""can I make them adore me"" game has changed gradually over the past six or so years, I've found it challenging to socialize. My therapist and a few others tell me I'm an introvert, but I disagree. I enjoy the bustle of being around other people. I like to sit and watch. I like to feel the energies around me and predict situations and make stories. Being in public doesn't make me anxious or nervous or tired; it often makes me feel a bit more livened. 

The part I have trouble with is sustaining conversation I have zero interest in. Small talk, general gossip, even catching up on the day-to-day intricacies of life are not stimulating for me. But I am Southern Polite, so I will smile and nod and throw out little lines that show I'm listening to validate the person, all the while, I pick my cuticles until I bleedbleedbleed. Then, when it's over, it's like I can finally exhale, and I have to isolate to recharge.* Sometimes I even binge eat while watching a show I've seen multiple times just to soothe myself.

On the other hand, talking with others about things that interest me gives me so much energy, and I feel invigorated just being around these people and listening, not even when I give input. This dynamic fuels me so much that I forget to eat and I don't want to sleep or stop or leave.

Anybody else feel like this??

*I came up with an analogy for this energy exchange. People have varying depths. When we socialize, we exchange energy from our wells. Some people don't need much, so when we give them our energy, they fill up quickly. Some of us are deeper, so when we interact with more shallow people, they simply do not have the capacity to return our expended energy. Not that they don't want to, but they literally do not have enough to fuel us, so those who have deeper wells always leave needing to refuel somehow.",0
"How do I cope with alienation? I swear this is relevant to the sub... 


I don't know how much you'll relate here, but I've been dealing with a strong sense of alienation my entire life. I know people who bond with others over cars, games... Anything really, except for me. They develop deep friendships, and I feel excluded. I can crack a joke and make people laugh, I somehow understand how to get people to open up rather quickly, often the first time speaking to them. A lot of people know me and seem to like me because of these things, but there's a limit to how much I can realistically bond with people, with the exception of a handful of individuals I've met throughout my life. Literally. I can count them on one hand. People who share the same interests, people who I can have real conversations with, conversations that leave me satisfied. I'm bored with the things most people talk about and it's extremely rare that I get to have a conversation that's truly engaging. 


This is horrifying to me. I want acceptance, I want to bond to people, I put in the effort, but there's a certain kind of genuine interpersonal relationship that cannot be formed under false pretenses. The thing is, my best friend is somebody I've bonded with over these kinds of things, but most of his friends are very different than me and they seem to like me, but I've never gotten close to them. He's very different than me in general, but he happens to be gifted. 


I got to meet up with an old friend today, and he happens to be one of the few people I bond with. We spoke for hours about linguistics, politics (we have highly differing views but that's rarely a point of contention), philosophy, etc. We also have a similar sense of humor and he's one of the few people I can joke back and forth with. I expressed some insecurities with him, primarily involving curiosity that I can't satisfy and feeling too ""stupid"" to pursue them. I told him I felt like I only understood simple, easy to grasp concepts and he reminded me that there aren't many people who could hold a conversation like that with him.


This became another reminder, in a way, of how alienated I feel. I'm mainly here in this subreddit because I resonate overwhelmingly with the experiences people here seem to have, it's the only place I can really talk about these things and I was considered as gifted as a child, but I still doubt myself. Regardless of whether or not I'm gifted, I still feel this alienation. It has me in a spiral or feeling better about myself, ridiculous amounts of curiosity, opening up about my passions, alienation and self doubt setting in and the onset of depressive thoughts and feelings/ loss of motivation. 


Does this resonate with anyone? Is there a way to resolve this? Is alienation an inevitability?",0

Why am I an academic failure if I'm smarter than Einstein? I know he was an academic failure too, but only in elementary school.

"Can wisc IV be wrong? My child recently had a psychoeducational assessment and the result was average intelligence and severe ADHD. I immediately joined many ADHD support groups and quickly realized something felt off. My child has no emotional outbursts - in fact they have great control over their emotions for their age (8). They have no issues with executive functions - in fact they are very orderly and prone to planning in advance. They're social and easily make friends. They're never late and keep better track of time in the morning than my teen. My child reads above grade level, does math above grade level, teachers tell me they're mature for their age. Their speech therapist states their vocabulary is above average (something we also noticed) but the wisc iv stated their vocabulary is below average. However they are impulsive, extremely distractible when bored, fidgets, etc. In trying to figure out if they were misdiagnosed I learned giftedness could look like ADHD. However, wouldn't that turn up on the assessment? Is it possible the test was wrong, or my child didn't fully understand the assessor's accent or something so didn't understand the question? I want to help them but I can't if I don't know what's going on. Should I do a second assessment?

"Mental games I do not claim to be gifted and have never been diagnosed, however I am searching for people who do the following; play mental games with oneself.

When I was about 5 I started telling stories to myself to help me sleep (I've always had sleeping issues). As I grew older these fantasies became more and more elaborate until I came up with what I call the game.

The game is a grand strategy game revolving around becoming the greatest leader of a setting. The premise is as follows. First starts the prologue in which 100 players enter the game as leaders of nations, planets, organizations, etc. Their goal is to become the sole remaining player ruler in the world. Each player gets starting resources and far going customisation options to personalize their nation. Then, when the game starts it I play all players optimally, so that it keeps being interesting.

"It all makes sense now I was considered a ""gifted kid"" in elementary and middle school. Around the age of 12, due to a series of traumatic events and isolation, I developed severe depression, anxiety and OCD, which caused my grades to slip, I was diagnosed with mild Asperger's, and the rest of my school years were a struggle. Having never learned how to study in the first seven years of school also became an issue. Over the years, I put the possibility of giftedness to rest and tried to go about my life in a different way than I was expected to in my younger years.


I was diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago, and that led to me falling down a rabbit hole, doing as much research as I could about the subject. Around the same time, I went through another series of highly traumatic events that led to severe depression and PTSD, and I began to feel mentally sluggish. At this point, it had been years since I had the opportunity to dive into any of my passions at great depth, and I slowly began reengage with those things while wrestling with mental health struggles in the periphery. I started to think more deeply about the state of my life and my place in the world, and found myself feeling like a tiny atoll in the middle of the Pacific, no matter where I went or with whom I spent my time. 


Nobody I knew had the same interests as me, and that had been true my entire life. I thought being around other neurodivergent people would help, and it did to an extent, in that my communication quirks are overlooked or considered normal among them, but my interests still differ and vary widely. I have one close friend, and he's the only person I feel truly understands me, and he's also quite gifted. He's one of the very few people I've been able to have interesting conversations with in my life. With most others, I keep trying to spark deeper conversations but that normally ends the interaction right then and there. 


I avoided considering the possibility of being gifted, primarily because I despise the label. It sounds conceited. However, I was curious if I could find any answers as to why I am the way I am by looking into it. On top of feeling alienated from nearly everybody, I recently discovered that my brain works in a lot of strange ways, including a multitude of rare forms of synesthesia, several of which, I'm yet to find in another person. While that doesn't denote giftedness, it's something that contributes to this sense of alienation. 


I started reading articles written by psychologists specializing in giftedness and I was alarmed. It was as if they had observed my life and thought processes and listed them out in detail. Perfectionism and self criticism, high levels of curiosity, overexcitabilities (especially intellectual, emotional and sensual), a tendency for introversion, having so many ideas in my head and passions to follow that it feels like there isn't nearly enough time in the world for me learn even a fraction of what I hope to. I often stay up studying until I can no longer keep my eyes open anymore because it's so exciting to learn and frustrating that I'm about to be interrupted by eight hours of sleep. At the same time, I'm dealing with a lot of existential concerns, leading me to feel extremely limited by my own body and physiological needs. 


Amid this discovery, I had another realization when I visited my best friend's family. His grandfather was a physicist, his aunts and uncles all have careers in education and medicine, and he grew up with resources I could've only dreamed of growing up. I was briefly talking about my hobbies with his aunt, mentioned how much I love reading, and she told me she was getting rid of some old books that were gathering dust, and I ended up coming home with books on sociology, philosophy, math and physics, and went to a bookstore a week later to pick up some books to fill in the gaps, adding to the dozen other interests that I'm always curious about. It was inspiring, but also sad because my family was nothing like that. I've spent two days with his family and fit in better than I did after two decades with mine. 


With my family, a few things were common for me. First, my cousins who were around my age would make almost a spectacle out of me to their friends, asking me questions about things I knew. Second, I'd get family members mad at me for correcting them about things they were wrong about, and third, I learned to mask by simplifying my speech and keeping my interests to myself. I still had an overactive mind and lacked any outlet. My dad saw something in me from a young age and tried to help by pushing me, but it had the opposite effect. My mind turned to extremely immersive imagination/ daydreaming just to occupy itself and I grew more isolated. 


There's a lot more, but this post is growing long enough already. Rediscovering this has given me some mixed feelings. Doubt, which I've always had, relief that things appear to be making sense, and shame, since writing all these things out feels conceited and I want to find a way to describe this that comes off as more neutral. When people tell me I'm smart, I typically just tell them that I happen to have an interest in a particular subject and downplay it the best I can. I've tried to attribute these things to autism, but years of pouring my guts out to therapists has led to me having to convince them that I was diagnosed with it.",0

"Can you tell time without a clock? Hey all!

I wondered how many of you can tell time without a clock?! My personal experience is that I can tell time by looking outside, feeling the environment or from my personal perception of time: in general I can estimate the right time with a 10 minutes deviation even if I haven’t looked at the clock for hours. Other examples: I have had periods in my life at which I awoke at 7.00 exactly for months and I found in primary school that I was much more skilled in estimating time: so when in grade 5/6 (in the Dutch system you are then 9-10 years old), we did an experiment with the whole class. The challenge was 3 minutes of quit and when you thought the 3 minutes were over, you stand up. Then, I already had quite a feeling of seconds and I counted. The first person that stood up was about half a minute early. I was the second person that stood up. I was several seconds too early. The rest of my class started standing up after half a minute or so after me. The last person finished when over 5 minutes had past. That was a moment in which I noticed that it might not be that normal to tell time so accurately. 

I wonder if this time-telling-trait (TTT, this is no official abbreviation) helped me feeling and understanding music. And I wonder in case TTT would more common in gifted people, could that explain why they tend to be more sensible to music and the technics of it?

"Questions about schooling my gifted son My son is 7 and gifted. He is in a great public STEM school but it’s probably not challenging enough. He was accepted into a “gifted” private school today and it’s expensive. 

In his current school he is very happy within his friend group, which is diverse. In the gifted school he would be one of a very small percentage of minorities. He’s there in a summer program and has been singled out a few times. 

We’re trying to choose the best schooling for him long term. Do we send him to a gifted school with some known clique issues and hope he’s socially in the right place or send him to one of the better public school systems in the country but not geared towards gifted kids that may be a better or more comfortable social fit but less challenging?

"Does anyone want to talk? I’ve been looking for so long, all people I asked said something like “sure go ahead”, I asked them if they we sure, and even told them what the topic was, and they all answered something like “yes! I’m sure, don’t worry”. Every single time they leave me, some ignore me, some say “I don’t know”… I’m not sad that they don’t know, it’s completely understandable, but they later said that they didn’t want to know either and didn’t want to talk, and that’s what makes me sad, that they say yes and then leave me.

I’d like someone to talk about deep/long topics. The only condition is, please, if you think morals are objective then don’t talk to me. It’s almost impossible to discuss ethical topics with someone that thinks their morals are objectively superior/inferior than others

Edit: I totally understand that some people don’t like certain topics, and I respect it. What I was talking about in the first paragraph is that I’m always there for others and the few times I need to talk to someone they all leave me. My friends and I are constantly talking, usually about mundane things because they enjoy those more, but the little times I *need* to talk about a deep topic they all go away… talking about these things is like an equivalent to venting/ranting for me.

"Am I gifted, or is it just impostor syndrome? I saw a post pretty similar to this one and I related to it to a degree, so i’ve come here to ask for some opinions. Of course someone being gifted is pretty subjective, we all agree and disagree if someone is gifted or not, so i’ll just go off of the majority opinion. I’m 13 years old, by the way!

For:

• I outperform everyone in my class in nearly everything.

• I’m fairly good at molecular biology & virology, and I am trying to learn Calculus.

• I scored 135 on a self-administered Ravens 2 IQ test.

• I am pretty fast at learning compared to the majority, especially in mathematics & tennis.

• My report cards tend to be amazing, with every subject except for listening & speaking being very good & excellent (listening and speaking is satisfactory)

• I love learning as long as it’s STEM related.

• I get extremely upset when I get anything on my report lower then Very Good.

• I know LOTS about computing, from cyber security to programming.

• I peaked 100 WPM in typing when I was 10-11, and averaged 90.

• I got nearly a perfect score on the national test for mathematics, and only got 1 wrong, and I hadn’t even heard of anything in the question.

Against:

• My friends call me stupid.

• My genetics for intelligence are horrible, my Mum is borderline stupid, doesn’t know 1+1 (literally) but my Dad is pretty smart, & my grandfather is one of the best lawyers in NZ.

• My brother has ADHD, and there’s a pretty high chance that a sibling of someone with ADHD will also have it, and ADHD affects intelligence.

Yeah that’s basically all I could list. Thanks!",0
"lowering yourself/makeing yourself smaller so you don't become a target I used to do this a lot. When I was really good at somethin (as a gifted we learn stuff quicker) i would always pretend i was bad, or not as good so that people wouldn't jealous me. Especially as a kid i would do this. Kids can be cruel, and i would get bullied for being good at school, or at tennis.  
There is also the fear of being lonely. It might not be founded, or based in reality, but i used to believe, if no one else is as good as me, and if I want to be ""the best"" at soemthing, or be really good and elicit jealousy/envy, who's gonna love me ??

Now I'm in college. I spent 2 years in my first study discipline until I stopped because it wasn't made for me. Now I'm in my 3rd year of my ""new"" studies and everything seems hard af now.

I know I'll have to fail and study hard until I succeed but knowing I won't be perfect at the first try gives me a kind of anxiety. I'm scared of opening my notes and study them.

Any tips to help me study, be less scared of working or even change my view on failure?

A bit of context: I had a quite harsh eating disorder in September-December 2021. I spent most of my time sleeping because I didn't have enough energy to do anything. I failed 5/9 exams. Second semester, it began well until time came to study and... I was already terrified. Then my ex left me so it was a hard time too. I failed 3/9 exams in June.

"What to do for my gifted son was acceleration a mistake emotionally intense at times… My son was going to enter kindergarten the year of covid he didn’t like wearing masks and I am fortune enough to be able to be at home. So he ended up doing cyber school he did kindergarten and 1st grade in one year. They tested him and he is too 2%iq he got into Mensa. He is very creative music writing reading etc. He has ability to remember many things (selective towards his interest) so for 2nd grade he did cyber again but with days going in to do electives. Now for this school year I wanted to enroll him at our district but I have a horrible feeling he will have outburst as he gets anxiety and can cry or yell at times. I tried earlier in the year to help with that and even tried counseling but they pretty much blew me off because he seems so well spoken and good. It’s just at random times when he gets overwhelmed and has outbursts that are bad. I’m just sooo worried he is goin to not do well if he has these outburst at school. Although he does good he can get anxious on timed tests and math also. He doesn’t like to be challenged at times I feel like he may like just being eons ahead of kids. He is probably ahead even at 3rd grade level but it would be more challenging. Long term I do not feel I can homeschool him I get stressed and we clash over getting him to learn. I really want him to socialize and get in habit of school as well so he can learn some more work ethics. He does some social things thru the cyber school but eventually I have hopes of him getting some independence as an only child I have babies and smother him. 

I feel like I made a bad decision accelerating him. Emotionally he is probably ok considering he is technically a 1st grader but then with the grade jump possibly not. I also feel like I robbed him and me of a year of his childhood. Should I keep him home again And possibly redo the year ? And enter next year as a 3rd grader? My husband just says send him if he fails socially he will learn but that breaks my heart and I know he is so sensitive it will be tough on my son. 

I do think he is smart and capable but then I see he wants to still watch little shows or old Sesame Street (because of the music) and think he is way to young. That would be ok for a 1st grader going to second but for a soon to be 3rd grader maybe not. 

He does like older kids though his one friend of 4 years is going to 3rd and he has 10year old friend etc.

"Giftedness and Synaesthesia. Hi, first post on here. Still not sure what to think of this subreddit, but interested to hear what people say. I am a gifted person, who also has synaesthesia (genetically determined). I also study neuroscience, hence my interest in this specific subject.

I'm interested in the connection between giftedness and synaesthesia, particularly in those not on the clinical autistic spectrum. Synaesthesia is the natural tendency to process sensory (perceptual) information using another modality, such as seeing colours when hearing music.

Synesthetes have greater functional connectivity between sensory systems, and greater whole-brain integration. The synesthetic brain is biased towards novel connections and cross-modal information processing. This also manifests as novel ideational connections. Synaesthesia is present in all brains to some extent (it is a spectrum), but in those with enough of it to be noticed, it induces a significantly different experience of reality than in neurotypical people. In addition to obviously apprehendable senses, it can cause alternate processing between any two perceptual phenomena. This is not limited in any sense, possible synesthetic states include ideational-sensory phenomena, and even  cross-processing of sensations such as time perception.

According to my own observations, synaesthesia seems to have two ""types"" that occur. Both autistic people and non-autistic people can be synesthetic, but the proportion of it occurring in autistic people is slightly higher than in non-autistic people. Non-autistic phenotypes of synaesthesia tend to correlate heavily with high performance, particularly in creative and ""outside the box"" activities. The reason for this difference is (I assume) the sensory processing issues that come with ASDs. Some synesthetes score strangely on clinical autism measures, in that they tend to be further away from autism than the average person. This category includes myself. In some cases, multiple standard deviations away from ""normal"".

My questions are: are there any other synesthetic people here? Does your synaesthesia impact your giftedness? Do you find yourself making connections other people do not, seeing unexpected patterns across categories? Do you have any insight into the connection between these two categories of neurodiversity? I'm interested in whatever you have to say.",0

"What does it really mean to be ""Gifted""? I'm coming to understand a lot of people here aren't really gifted, some people are trapped in bias and a narrow thought process without the application of naturally using integrative thinking to its full potential.

We can say it's a baseline of an IQ of 130 and a heightened ability to process quantitative information, but the fact that the definition of giftedness varies from place to place makes the concept inherently arbitrary. This leads to the inclusion of people who may not even be gifted, and the exclusion of people who are. 

To me giftedness seems of a pseudoscience, and not really understood in full detail. How can one claim to be gifted and let it change the way they think  based off of this?",0

I don't know if the acquisition of this method has increased my iq, but my logical thinking and its speed increased to a part that I classify as enormous. maybe it just made me smarter and a certain placebo effect did the rest. however, the cognitive boost was really there. it would be as if i had discovered a whole new world filled with deductions just waiting to be analyzed and evaluated by me.

"Am I gifted or just weird? As I’ve learned more about what giftedness is, I’ve come to realize how complex this phenomenon truly is, and thus become more and more unsure about where I stand with respect to it. I’d just like someone else’s two cents on my situation.

I’m still pretty young. But all my life, I’ve just felt a bit…”different”. When I was young, I loved to read. By the age of three, I had memorized children’s books in German and English, even though I couldn’t actually read them. I had a strong ability to recognize words and sounds. I started playing the violin at age six, and loved it. Technically, I was fairly skilled but nothing extraordinary. My biggest strength was being able to memorize, and to play very musically. People would tell me that I was lucky, because musicality is difficult to teach. But I was just playing the music the way I knew it. 

Socially and at school, however, I struggled tremendously. I didn’t fit in, because I was kind of a weird kid and didn’t understand social cues or boundaries, which didn’t make me a lot of friends. I was always daydreaming, and loved books a lot more than I loved socializing. People my age didn’t make sense to me, and I was more comfortable with adults. My teachers had trouble getting me to follow directions. I was always asking a lot of questions and was generally extremely curious about the world. I hated following structure, and often had a lot of trouble controlling my emotions or filtering my thoughts to be situationally appropriate. Though I was terrible at math, I adored science, writing, and reading. Anything with “big picture” ideas was good. For some reason, answers and patterns in these areas would just come to me naturally, which I didn’t really understand. I could understand subjects I’d never taken, and draw conclusions from information I wasn’t familiar with. 

While my parents and those around me told me I was smart, I didn’t really believe them. I struggled in school. I was never the top of my class. I’ve had horrible anxiety throughout my life because of how much I think about things. My parents took me to a psychologist, who diagnosed me with adhd. I know that a lot of my weird ways are because of that. 

But I still don’t really understand whether I’m gifted or not. I’m not a genius or a prodigy. My IQ is probably isn’t high enough to qualify. I’m not Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein. I suck at science and math. I just love to learn and absorb information. I am deeply creative and love to teach myself new skills. My way of thinking about things is kind of strange, and I love abstract things. What does all of this mean? Who am I?

TLDR; this is my long ass life story. Am gifted, or just strange?",0
"Giftedness and obsession with networks and maps Hi everyone!

I was born in Paris and as such, I used to take the subway almost daily. Thanks to hyperlexia, I was able to read the network map quite early and as such, I learnt by heart each and every station on each and every line there was by the age of 4. (And I actually ended up obsessed with it to the point I still know them by heart today and I'm already fully aware of every line extension to come at least until the end of the decade)

A few years later, a TV channel produces and broadcasts a game show that's pretty much a freak show with gifted children (I don't remember how it was named but it definitely was something along the line of ""Little Prodigies"") who have to solve brain teasers and answer questions about their favorite niche subject (so pretty much BBC Mastermind with kids). One of the rounds happened to be having to name the end cities of national highways, then giving the shortest route between two cities using only highways.

So, remembering all of this, **I was wondering if it was common among gifted people to have a keen interest in networks and maps (mostly road and transit maps).**

"Gifted and not reaching their potential? I've never done an iq or was identified as gifted in school I did do very well but due to an unstable household growing up i have a 9th grade formal education.

Because of my daughter who is gifted looked into the subject. Which led me to my own realization...how do I know without being formally tested?  I identity with a lot of the stereotypical ""traits "" you find online  fast learner,  adhd, good at complexity and abstract concepts and make connections. 
With a 9th grade education I work as an executive in a finance company so for me ""finding out "" is more of a cathartic 
Experience . I now know that i can understand pretty much any concept so professionally it is an amazing experience to somewhat help the impostor syndrome.

My daughter's journey is very different i can see at 12 her world view and how she sees her self in it is very different than mine (everyone's is different i know) I can see how the ""label gifted"" and knowing what that means can cause the stereotypical things you read about kids burning out and ""wasting"" their gift by ""not accomplishing to their potential ""
But what are we talking about when we say potential? 
It's an interesting problem we have with the school system which in my perspective  serves only as a tool to guarantee an education that will give someone the knowledge to guarantee (most of the time) a job above poverty line.

I like where I’m going because a lot of the kids there are nerdy and all, but I still feel imposter syndrome when talking to people. Me being extremely gifted makes it hard to not feel different even when around “smart” non-gifted people or borderline gifted.  Sometimes I get really bad social anxiety when talking to them and question myself on whether I’m contributing enough to the convo, talking too much or too little, etc. I know that’s normal especially when you’re just about to start college/uni. But I can’t help but feel this feeling of dread that I will end up lonely and unable to fit in or find my “group.”",0

"Iowa test? In 5th grade I took a standardized test called the “Iowa Test” which said I scored the equivalent of an 11th or 12th grader (I think it was “11th grader in 5th month of school” equivalent).

My parents were not interested in giftedness testing and my school didn’t have resources related to probably even talking to my parents about it. Does anyone have any experience with the Iowa test and know how one might see if that is a gifted score",0
"Do you have experience with reading problems as a gifted person? Hey there everyone, I was wondering how many of you have experienced reading problems in combination with giftedness? I have the impression that gifted people are either terrible at reading, preferably don’t even touch a book, or excellent readers that can hardly stop reading books. Unfortunately, I was in the ‘terrible-at-reading-group’, but after being tested at young age, I had no diagnosis of dyslexia. And I already had glasses, so my vision was sharp according to the optician. So, that is something you just have to live with they say. I investigated this feature about myself and I could not add up that everything but reading was so easy. My journey ended last October when I found out that my visual focal points were not working together properly and I was subscribed with prism glasses. These glasses changed my life, since I now can read far more easily and my lifetime of headaches has stopped. 

Can anyone else relate to this story or does anyone have experience with prism glasses?

&#x200B;

If you’re interested, this is the background of the story:  
So, I have never been actually diagnosed with being gifted, but had clear signs from a young age: high vocabulary, extreme eager to learn, quick learner, naturally musically gifted, very alert...

I wanted to skip classes and my parents thought I might be gifted. Then my teachers did not even consider, because I was terrible at reading.

Not only regular reading was a problem, sheet music was a problem as well.

I learn very, very easy from audio/audio visuals, but reading... I really hated it, because I was very slow and it was like I could read the words without picking up the message. As if I hardly understood what I read, while the story was perfectly clear when the story was physically told to me.

I have also suffered from (severe) headaches and I have always been told this was tension headache, while I could hardly believe that was the true cause.

So, last year at age 26, I was considering I might be gifted, after not having really thought about it since the negative reaction of teachers in primary school. I feel quite sure I am gifted, although I have not been diagnosed yet.

But then I thought: why, WHY can't I just read???? I should be able when I am gifted, right? Is there something wrong with me? Am I lazy? So I searched all over the internet and found 2 things: 1) internet page that mentioned gifted people that have trouble with reading and were misdiagnosed with dyslexia (for years). There were experiences with kids that benefitted from prism(a) glasses in this case. 2) I found a doctor that specialized himself with the Utermöhlen glasses. I read what people were treated there for: migraine, ménière disease and PEOPLE WITH READING PROBLEMS. These glasses are a specific type of prism glasses. Prism glasses correct you focal point.

So it turned out that my visual focal points were not in the middle of my eye (it is a sort of lazy eye, but you could hardly see that). My eyes needed correction both horizontally and vertically. For 26 years I have been tiring my eyes and head by continuously having to compensate. Unconsciously I had double vision and two focal points that did not work together to be able to read.

Last October I got my new glasses and reading is a not a problem anymore. Headaches are also not a part of my daily routine anymore. I now dare to try new hobbies and improve skills, such as properly reading sheet music, playing the violin and learning how to code.

"Maybe I was never gifted or is this imposter syndrome...? Hi all,I am a 14 years old biological male from the UK, studying in year 9 or ""8th grade"". I was told that I am ""gifted"" when I was nominated to a gifted programme called HKAGE when I was in Hong Kong (I moved to the UK last year), but this year, I am just uncertain regarding my intelligence or my giftedness to a rather high level I suppose and the reason for that is mainly because I performed really rubbish in my exam in 2021 December and I even failed maths which is one of my best subject or at least supposedly. Anyway, I know there is no other than getting a professional to make a diagnose but I could not get that at the moment yet, so I guess I would just say some of the reason for and against if I am gifted.

For:

* I have strong academic interest:
* I learned calculus this year on my own during my spare time
* I also enjoy learning quantum physics or any physics in general
* I like doing maths problem during my free time
* I was in a gifted programme called HKAGE (was in it for a year but then covid and me moving to the UK)
* I am usually ahead of my class in maths, physics and music
* I have common gifted ""syndrome"":
* I get easily upset by poor grades
* I sometimes feel bored in class (it is more like I want to ""fast forward"" the lesson like a youtube video)
* I generally find my use of language rather formal and advance to a certain extent comparing to my age group. For instance, I got 13 in terms of my fog index with my Reddit comment history.
* I have a strong sense of justice and I feel offended when people are not following rules which can often lead to me feeling negative intense emotions
* I struggle to relate with my peers (but I suspect that might also just because of my poor social skill, selective mutism, autism and social anxiety?)
* I can be somewhat logical for most of the time.
* I was part of my primary school's STEM competition teams and we used to win competitions each year which is held by Hong Kong's leading universities.
* I also tried one of the past paper of UKMT Intermediate Maths Challenge for year 11 or below (""10th grade"" or below) and I got Gold award.
* ""Straight A"" (but that might not be a sign of giftedness in particular)
* I picked a language rather fast: I managed to be better than my class who have been studying Spanish for 2 years more than I do, according to my Spanish teacher

&#x200B;

Against:

* I failed my maths exam twice (once in year 9 and once in year 1)
* I was not as gifted as other story told in this sub by other parents:
* I struggled to memorise the multiplication table during year 2 or 3
* I do not understand knowledge as fast or as easy comparing to how I was few years ago (but that might also be the increased difficulty?)
* My dad and my brother would often consider me as dumb or ""r3tard""
* I have never tried any sort of form IQ test
* I got 100 in Mensa's home test (for all ages)
* I got 118 in Mensa's Norway online test (for 16-17 years old, that was the youngest option)
* I think I am not as knowledgeable comparing to other gifted individual my age
* I am only ahead of my class for serval subjects but not all
* My knowledge can varies a lot in even one subject:for instance, I know some uni level physics but I do not know all GCSE physics content (a national exam in England and Wales for year 11 or ""10th grade"")
* I tend to give up on stuff quite easily when I was younger
* I could not get good grades without revising much, so perhaps it is my hard-work rather than giftedness?

Does being gifted cause hyperfixations? I’ve been wondering this for a while and could never find a solid answer online.

"Vent: I dont like being gifted in this world I dont have a diagnosis but I dont need one to aknowledge a big difference when it comes to mental intensity. I've met in my life several gifted individuals and I can tell there's a huge difference. I for once gave fully my attention to someone which is not the case with an average person. Now that I've binge eat alot of information on giftedness I cant unsee the gap and I realise how unfairly I've been treated all my life because of my difference. I grew up with alot of adversities with little no support and now I'm just so frustrated of how average people act towards giftedness. Society praise them so much (Elon Musk, Albert Einstein, Jeff Besos, etc) meanwhile people are absolute trash when they meet one in the street : it seems like its too close to their ego. They judge someone with emotions and emotions are cruel which is why Im often on the receive end of bad attitude especially in customer services. I dont talk about people that had a bad day or old people tired of their life, Im talking about Mr. And Mrs. everyone, I sometimes get a good responses or a really uspset reactions when all Ive said is a very basic normal customer services lines . I often get to see the worst or the best in people really quickly and as much I may appear so intense and somehow different they are intense in their own ways too. I just cant keep up with their unstable opinions about difference and neurodivergent people.",0
"Emotional vs intellectually gifted? I don’t even know if that’s the best way to put it but, is there a difference?

She has a crazy memory, can remember things from 6-12 months ago. She has great control of her emotions and doesn’t throw tantrums like other children. 

On the other hand she knows her basic knowledge.. all her colors, recognize some letters and numbers , can count to 20. She isn’t reading chapter books  🤣. I do 100% believe that if I worked with her more she will pick it up quickly. Which is what I plan to do with when summer is over.

***""i wAS ToDAy yeArS oLD wHen I FoUnD OuT""*** that a lot of people don't have a strong internal monologue. 

I've always thought that most people had lots of thoughts and opinions throughout the day, as I myself was constantly flooded with analysis and essays of thought while I was observing and trying to figure out my world. This, looking back at my teenage years, as helped me understand a lot about my past anxieties. I was constantly in anguish wondering at what depths my peers around me had thought of me and if they have had seen my weaknesses as I had interpreted I had seen in them. My image was everything to me and I couldn't let even one crack slip through.

Very recently, I've had inner monologues described to me as a ***quiet voice,*** speaking in the background of ones mind. Which of course, was very shocking to me.

"Being gifted wasn’t such a hang up when I was a kid I really feel bad for some of the “younger” generation who seem SO interwoven with being gifted.

"Low-sensitivity resources? Heya! I'm looking for resources on low-sensitivity. Whenever I try to look for it I only get advice for high-sensitive individuals or at most some short articles directed at parents for low-sensitive children, neither of which are helpful for me.

I know that, probably due to my highly giftedness, I'm pretty low sensitive when it comes to vision and especially touch and it's caused numerous problems in my life already, so I would really like to read about some ways to handle it more effectively.

- Always want to chew on stuff (which makes me want to eat a lot as well)

"Give Advice or No? In the last few months I've had such a hard time of it with certain people (irl). I can see clearly what will happen to them, ie that if they continue to act/behave in a certain way that it will cause long term problems for them engaging with other people. Example - if you don't tone x down the others will start to distance themselves. Or - you really should make more of an effort to listen, your ideas are good but you need to listen to their concerns or you won't build trust with them. 

So I've tried to give advice to them or forewarn them, or ask them to at least consider what I think in that kind of way. Some people do listen and they're better for it. But recently my attempts to do what I've usually done for people I consider friends haven't really worked out. This one in particular is really bothering me. 

So I was talking to this person, let's call them A. So I had texted A over an issue that needed urgent attention. Afterwards A pulled me up and said they were unhappy with how I spoke to them - which ok fair enough I make mistakes too. So I apologised and then they said this was how I always spoke to them. I said in the heat of the moment in that instance I could understand they would unhappy with how I spoke but could not accept that how I acted just then and always was no different. 

Anyways one thing leads to another so I decide to pull up A on their general attitude to me and everyone else. They can be intimidating/pushy and occasionally dismissive, and I would say disrespectful. This causes a back and forth. A's answers are vague and avoidant on these points, to which I say they're not being straight or genuine. To which they respond that I am being controlling even asking that. To which I say they're being hypocritical, how can they complain about they way I talk to them but completely refuse to engage which how they talk to me? Then I was blocked.

What I want to know is this. In this case or a similar situation should I push the issue? Or should I let them fend for themselves? I just want them to reach their potential. I mean the outcome here was not ideal for me but I would much prefer this than to see someone not reach their potential. I will say though at the same time I am so f***ing tired of being attacked just because I think and act differently to everyone else - they assume stuff about me for absolutely no reason. Is there anything I can do to reduce this frustration?",0

"How do you study ? First of all, please don't judge me for all of this. I've never talked about this to anyone excepted my parents and my previous therapist, so I hope this post will be met with kindness.

I have always been different. I've always thought it was autism (I've never been diagnosed, but even my previous therapist told me I was probably autistic but didn't had enough time to diagnose me), but there is something else.

Since as long as I remember, people (particularly teachers) always told me that I have ""incredible capacities, but no school spirit"". For example : I learnt english by myself (it isn't my birth language) because I wanted to play Undertale. Before Undertale, my grades in english were extremely bad : I went from an average of 7/20 to an average of 19/20. I could technically have learned english at school, like a normal student, but I couldn't : it was too boring.

My primary school teachers told me I was gifted, because I had good grades at the time, but I've never believed them. However... I've recently realized that I have never truly worked a single day of my life. I have always did the bare minimum : went to class, trusted my memory to remember most of the things... and that's all. I stopped doing any school exercise at 11, stopped reading my lessons at 14, spent almost all my time on internet from age 12 to age 18, but I still had my high school diploma and other high-level music diplomas. Most of my friends had to work their ass off for it.

You could think this is cool, but it is actually a huge problem. Now I don't know how to work, because I've never had to. I have dreams, studies I want to do, but I literally don't know how to work for them. Without working, I am still average in most of the subjects I want to study, but I am extremely bad in science, which is a shame because my studies rely quite a lot on it. And I have no idea on how to study science. I go to class, read my lessons, I even do some exercises sometimes, and while for everything else it would be more than enough, for science it is clearly not enough because I fail.

I have enough of being average at everything and bad at science, I know I could do a lot more but I don't know how. I know it would GREATLY help if the lessons were entertaining and ""fun"", but I don't know how to transform my science lessons into entertaining subjects I could deep dive into, like Undertale.

So my question is : **how do you work/study ? Do you know any ressources which could help me to study ?** I still don't believe I'm gifted, but I'm willing to try everything so that's why I'm asking you.",0
"Was my English teacher gifted? My old high school English teacher remains as one of my favorite people, and I’m starting to think she may have been gifted. 

She was quite a precocious student, but she never had the resources to make anything huge out of her life. For starters, she is a voracious reader, devouring any form of text she can get her hands on, and her class is infamous for its level of challenge. She was making freshman students do college level work, and at one point, she was told by the superintendent to dial it back.  She still pushed students though. By my senior year, she was having us write graduate level papers no less than 10 pages, precise MLA, and with annotated bibliographies to boot. She’d make up read at least 30 pages of an article for homework every night and quiz us on it the next day. (As a more specific example of what I remember, she made us annotate a chapter of our choosing of this book in my sophomore year: https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/contemporary-perspectives-on-rhetoric-3rd-edition_karen-a-foss_robert-trapp/338468/item/52700168/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlemWBhDUARIsAFp1rLUbda81U3wxWXBQVKNbW4TJt-VOd1aOT2yhuWyhXzGv6SMgWMFX63saAmv4EALw_wcB#isbn=1577662059&idiq=52700168). 

Secondly, she excelled in school. When she was in 8th grade, she took the ACT and received a 25, and by the time she was a sophomore, she received a score of 35. She also has never received anything less than an A her entire life, extending all the way up to her getting her Master’s degree. She once had a professor give her an F on a perfect paper because he said that she needed to know “what it felt like to fail” (he changed the grade at the end of the year, but it was in as a 0 until the last day of the semester [she told me how much it made her cry]). Keep in mind she got pregnant during high school and still continued to pursue higher education as well. 

Lastly, she is well rounded in every aspect. You name it, and she is good at it. She was in Allstate for choir, a record-setting varsity team member of her volleyball team (she is now a coach), a record setting cross-country runner, an artist, a builder, an activist, etc. 

I think the reason she was overlooked when she was younger was because she grew up in a small town (no one has ever been declared gifted at our small school).",0

"Korean dramas with gifted characters **Green Mother's Club** on Netflix

Mothers that compete in having the most successful child. 
The gifted child is central to the mother's storyline, but unfortunately not a big part of the storyline in the second half of the drama. You can see him have the typical problems of a gifted child; loneliness and pressure to perform.

It is a mini-TV-series with 16 episodes, a finished story. No more seasons. The style is makjang, which means that many (very) unrealistic things are happening, and all the people are dodgy and do questionable things. You can see the story as a vehicle to get personal development to happen, rather than look for realism. Do not get annoyed at for example the police interrogating people they know.

**Melancholia** on Viki

Mostly about school corruption, so it is a similar theme as to Green Mothers, but this time with older children. The lonely high school student that hated school, but got a teacher who understood him. Also a miniseries with no more seasons. The blurb on My dramalist is not really a good representation of the drama. Not quite as makjang as the *Green Mother's Club*. EDIT: Forgot to say that *Melancholia* talks about parallels between math and their life all the time. 

Lastly, if you want to see a gifted child in a variety program: **Return of the Superman** with Seungjae and his father, Go Ji Yong. If I link to the program, reddit will see this post as spam, so you have to find it yourself. For example ""Seungjae's linguistic skills that surprised everyone"". In the first episodes they are in the father talks about why they joined the program (because Seungjae had no friends).",0
"School is soul crushing I’m envious of those around me in school, how I feel like they're all idiots and can just accept mediocrity without questioning it, I don’t understand it even though I'm so jealous of it, and nobody seems to understand me. They try to include me in the community as they do everyone, but its become more clear to me that it doesn’t matter, nobody will understand even if they pretend they do. They’re all put in positions of mediocrity yet they don’t notice it, and don’t question it. It’s become glaringly obvious to me that for some god forsaken reason, I'm different, maybe I'm gifted or bright, everyone says I'm bright, maybe. I think I'm just stupid, that would make more sense, that this envy, anger and hatred is derived from my inability to correctly understand the situation I’m forced into. Or maybe its the ADD, maybe my adderall isn’t at a high enough dose, it makes me content, it makes me stop questioning things, I just wish I could live every hour of every day on it. Nothing here at school scratches my brain the same way say organic chemistry or pharmacology does, I wish I could just skip to college and do those topics my entire life instead of being trapped in this god forsaken hellhole, people already specialize for pretty much their entire life, why can’t I do so now. 

The medication is great and really helps with certain things but part of me hates that I need to be drugged so that I find school a tad bit less boring and soul crushing, I hate that the reason I got these meds were because I wanted to be able to adhere to how this system works only to realize it doesn’t really help with things I found boring in the first place. It annoys me that they can’t just push me off into college, it would get me out of their hair anyways, it would only benefit them. Or maybe if that happens I wouldn’t be smart enough, maybe I’m not bright, maybe I don’t have ADD, I could just be severely fucked in the head. It angers me that I’m the one that always needs to change and adapt to fit what they want me to do, why can’t they be the ones to change. 

Idk, I’ve been called bright and gifted by a lot of people. When I got diagnosed for ADD and took my meds, as soon as it started calming me down I thought that they all must have confused bright and gifted for ADD, I know the symptoms tend to overlap quite a bit. But once I found out that everything is still boring I didn’t really know what to think, it calms me down so I must have ADD, but I also have pretty much all the symptoms of giftedness (even though I really don't like saying that), of which they still appear when I'm on my meds. 

The combination of school being incredibly boring and me not being able to do the work causing me to become incredibly behind makes me feel like I’m just incompetent and an idiot.  


Note: sry for the long rant. It might meander a bit, was rather hard to put into words. Also sry if this doesn't fit in the gifted sub, I was debating either ADD or gifted and I personally felt it fit gifted more.  
Also I would kinda like some advice or support if anyone has any, couldn't put those two flairs on the post.",0

Do you guys believe there should be different measures in place for different levels of giftedness?

I want to feel the way I felt 3 years ago, but now I only get faint glimpses of hope that disappear into nothingness everytime I try to follow them as if my mind is taunting ne of the thing I want but can't have, I'm running out of options and I'm 13 and is starting highschool in 2 months where I need to take on responsibilities I'm simply not equipped to handle, I'm scared and my lack of energy/motivation is catching up to me. Its as if there is a impenetrable psychological wall preventing me from doing tasks or any forms of work by myself without advanced external intervention, I know I have very high potential that can get me far in life, but I have zero will power use them. Can I not have what I want? Is there something I need to do to repair my broken mind? I don't know what it is and therapy has not been helping. I'm at the lowest I can go and every time I have those glimpses of lucidity and hope, I don't follow it anymore, I just enjoy the couple seconds I get to have of that feeling I was once was fond and a customed to, but is unable to have anymore. I've been reed in on alot of Philosophy, mainly on the works of Friedrich Nietzsche and Plato and have been trying to find my absolute place in this cosmic monstrosity when I am yet to have one. They're my only route of passage to what ever drive to live or what Arthur Schopenhauer calls it ""The Will to live.""  But besides all the Philosophy and all the strength I can muster up in these trying times, I'm unable to proceed anymore and I feel like I am giving up or I have possibly already have given up. I wish to explore space and (I know it sounds immature and corny) but I want to be an astronaut, I want to travel 17000 kph around the globe in the unknown and see our blue marble from 330 km high but I have absolutely no energy to achieve these high dreams, its almost like I am an addict to nothing and go into withdrawal everytime I step out of my comfort zone, I've become suicidal because of this, I don't believe in God. I believe that once we die, the chemical reactions and bodily functions in our body ceases resulting in the absence of consciousness or otherwise known as ""Eternal Nothingness."" I feel like an elderly person who had lived life long enough and is ready to die but I don't want that, I don't want to be like that, I don't want to waste the most value years of my time on this earth because some stupid, petty, feeling of lost and nothing. I need something to spark the eye of the tiger in me that I felt long ago but I don't know how.",0

"Yet another ""Am I Gifted?"" Post Hello, 

I hope you guys appreciated my little bit of humor in the title, but I'll just cut straight to the facts: 

I'm a male in my late twenties who is currently struggling to find myself and what's truly important in my life. I've been going through an incredibly emotional and confusing time the past few months and it has really taken a toll on my mental health. In addition, I'm seeing a new therapist for the first time later this week and I'm scared.

I've only ever had 2 therapists in my entire life: a terrible psychiatrist, who also happened to be a therapist, I saw when I drew disturbing pictures in high school, and an EMDR therapist who helped me work through a couple of specific trauma incidents. Besides the incident in high school, my mother never believed that I needed therapy and even continues to this very day denies the fact that I need therapy. She simply believes I just need either an increase dosage or a new medication to solve all my problems. 

Growing up, I never really had too much trouble in the world of academics or career wise. I graduated top 10% of my class at university and am currently in an MBA program through the college I work for. I work in Admissions for a university and receive a tuition benefit, so I am essentially going for my MBA for free. 

Pretty much all of my troubles have been behavioral wise. Again, my mother never believed this was an issue since I did fine academically. I had a bad tendency to get into arguments, fights, and general disruptions throughout school which landed me in detention a lot (I even had my bag searched for weapons because I told a kid I was going to ""slit his f-ing throat"" if he didn't stop being annoying). I never had any weapons and none of these incidents never amounted to anything, but it really made my school life growing up miserable and to this day, I only speak to 2 people I went to high school with. I think that I'm good at fitting in to some degree since because it's a survival mechanism for me. I definitely have lukewarm friendships and a group of people I get along well with at work, but I still feel very disconnected or only partially connected to most people. Except for a Discord I rarely use, I'm not on any social media platforms. I personally think they're all a waste of time for me. As someone who is working a full-time job, a part-time job, and is an a MBA program full-time, I can't really afford to waste any time on social media (Plus, I don't trust anything nor do I relate to most things people post about anyway). I don't watch Netflix or any television (Baseball and Football games occasionally), movies, or video games (I used to, but I no longer have time). I don't bother having a smart phone as I see that as a waste of time as well, and I generally have a very bleak view of the US and the future of our world because it feels like everyone has given up, in my eyes (Which also contributes heavily to the feelings of disconnectedness). 

I honestly don't want to feel this way, but it's very difficult when I feel like I'm putting in a lot of effort to keep my life on track and to offer something to the world and it feels like everyone else is holding me back. Even when I ask for help, everyone seems to just brush me off as to them, I know what I'm doing and I don't need any support. This is precisely why I am scared to death about seeing this new therapist this week. I'm so tired of people brushing me off and I keep replaying scenarios in my head where in the best case, the therapist completely misunderstands me and in the worse case, completely invalidates all my feelings and despises me. In any scenario, it always just ends up with me leaving very upset or me being kicked out of therapy. My rational brain is telling me that this is highly unlikely, but apparently my emotions do not care because I am a nervous wreck.

Can anyone provide me with any insight of what they think of my situation? I'm really not sure of who I am, if I'm gifted, or what I should do. I do really want to go to this appointment, but I just don't know if my fear of the unknown outweighs the benefit of therapy, so to speak.

Thanks in advance!",0
"Am I actually gifted? I'm not sure what counts as gifted, and I see many people identified as gifted at a very early age. (I'm 13.)

I'd like some opinions (not going for a formal diagnosis here) on my supposed or not supposed giftedness.

&#x200B;

This is long, so bear with me.

I started at a tiny Montessori pre-school at age 2. I graduated from that pre-school at age 4. While there, I decided I wanted to read to my cousin when he was born. So yes, I learned to read at roughly age 3.5/4. I've also found videos of me reading/reciting addition and subtraction facts at that same age.

I then started pre-k at my local public elementary school (4, turning 5 in September). I remember being REALLY bored, and I came home crying about it being too easy a few times (a common occurrence in my life), but my parents had me stick with it.

Lo and behold, the next year, in kindergarten, I made it less than three weeks before my teacher wanted to move me up. (What a surprise!) So I moved up to 1st grade. I stayed at that school for the next two years, but all during second, I'd finish my work within a few minutes, to the point where I started bringing my own books to school to read. (the class library only had picture books, and I was already on Percy Jackson-sized books at age 6/7)

So my parents pulled me out and enrolled me in a public online charter. It was still pretty easy, but my mom supplemented it with outside work. In 5th, I chose a personalized curriculum, and the problem I had was that I could do all the work, even most of the high school stuff, so then it would dump me in 12th-grade work. Then I'd get frustrated since I couldn't figure out what was going on, so my teachers would reset it. Then the cycle would repeat, over and over again.

At the beginning of the next school year, my test scores were high enough that they had me take the end-of-year benchmarks. I passed them all with roughly 90% correct. So then they moved me to 7th. (yes, I was 10).

Fast-forward a few years, and I'm now going into 10th grade (I'll be 14 in a few months). I took the ACT in April (as a 9th grader), and got a 32. (perfect score in reading, 8/12 in writing). I'm already planning to start APs and dual enrollment classes.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my novel haha. I also somewhat have the classic obsessions. I'll get really into something for a few weeks or months, and I just keep all that knowledge. My reoccurring obsessions are architecture, writing (started a novel, have 25,000+ words now), college searching (ik I'm weird), personality tests/astrology, and gymnastics code/judging.

All my friends call me the smart, responsible one, and I've always been the teacher's favorite. So I just kinda want to know how other people's experiences compare, and if anyone thinks I'm actually considered gifted?",0
"Looking for Friends (yes you) Hi friends in the making,

Connection and relatability are more difficult for us, so here's my shot at that! I'm not actually sure if I'm gifted but I seem to have a sizable chunk of the characteristics and suffer from the same issues(mainly loneliness). 

Anyways, I'm an undergrad from the US, and am interested in making friends around philosophy, engineering, music, travelling, charity work, and photography. Figuring out how to best live my life has become my recent obsession, in context of normative ethics systems, daily life, psychology, values, states of consciousness, etc. I'm working on a wave power idea as well, and anything that involves inventing and mechanisms is entertaining to me. Tried to improve flywheels and draw up some sort of hypothetical thermal battery but those were disastrous lol. I mostly listen to 1990s indie rock/shoegaze and dg but would love to hear some new tunes, and the other interests are fun cultural exchanges. 

Cool and objectively good people would reach out after reading this, so be a good person :D",0
"I got no awards for my grade 8 graduation I know ill sound like a nieve teen in this but I'm currently pissed off, I got the highest art mark in my grade which was a 95 and frequently got very high marks for the arts and yet the artistic award goes to a completely random person who go nowhere near the marks that I did. And if I don't get an art award, I should get a science award, I got the highest marks in my class for science, my teacher even had to stop me from answering the questions so that other people get a chance to answer right, BUT NOOO... the award goes to some sleaze ball jerk who slacked in class every chance he got. What I'm trying to get at is I spent 10 FUCKING YEARS IN THAT SHIT HOLE, TRYING MY ABSOLUTE BEST TO GET GOOD MARKS AND ALL I GET IS A CHEAP ASS BROCHURE QUALITY BOOKLET ABOUT YOUR FUTURE IN HIGH SCHOOL, WHAT A SICK JOKE!

"Unique differences in thinking? I have quite a few differences in how I think that others do not appear to share. I have however heard of some other gifted people sharing similar experiences, such as thinking in abstract images. I find that it is a qualitative difference in thinking, but personally I haven't quite put my mind on a decision on whether it is beneficial to do this or not.   


For example, my use of language changes drastically when I think in abstract images instead of words. Example: ""My next descriptor runs obscure configurations that nonetheless exempla this process"". I find that I am using words I haven't really used before when I am thinking like this, that nonetheless do appear to fit when I really look back at them.   


As for the image in my head in the earlier case I had an image of a string of around 6 lights starting from one light line that looked as though it carried a mix of tune sheets and programming code, spinning clockwise, into a sort of sunlight appearing exit. To me it makes sense but obviously I don't think others would make sense of it.   


It might also be obvious from this that I can restrain my generation of these images. It kind of makes me stumped. I can do a bunch of things, and could develop these further, but I can also equally so not do them. Getting an idea of what is better, where and how is something I feel I really need. I just don't have anyone to discuss these things with. I have found thinking in abstract images gives the feeling of just really understanding mathematics or other text instantly, however I am equally so unsure on whether to trust this feeling or not, it could be bias from more associative images being present. There are so many other internal experiences and different ways of thinking I am internally aware of and can make use of, it's just so unguided. For the sake of this post I am sticking to getting an answer on abstract image thinking.   


Does anyone else think like this or in other unique ways? Any comments on such ways of thinking? Particularly downsides, strengths, improvements, differences, etc?",0
"Looking to know gifted people Long story short gifted condition has caused me to become somewhat misanthropic yet one of my hobbies is to get to know people from different backgrounds to see if I can find anybody that I can respect even slightly.

Send me a private message if u want to talk, I specially enjoy controversial topics since they make it easier to know the other person, but any topic is fine, really. Please, if you are the typical self-deprecating low self esteem dEpReSsEd *nihilistic* edgelord that uses intelligence as an excuse for their shortcomings dont bother. Mental health is definitely a thing but you know how it is sometimes. I guess this should serve as an introduction.

If ur 2 special for this u can also relate in the comments or just post the classic bullshit about how completely wrong I am about everything because you have had slightly different experiences. Either way its gonna be entertaining and it will give me a better understanding of this community, which is the whole point.

"Wisc-R high comprehension and coding. Is it aspergers? Hello, from what i remember i had really high comprehension and coding(17 and 19) part results from a wisc-r iq test that i had when i was a child. I have symptoms of Asperger's, can understand social cues but overthink too much and focus on one subject, i also have high anxiety.

However when i read the general Wisc-R test results of people with Aspergers i saw that they lacked heavily on comprehension and coding(from a few academic papers).

Now my question is do i still have aspergers? Do i have a very high functioning version of it? Is that why i had high coding and comprehension? Thanks in advance",0
"Can a neurotypical person have a slight difference in cognitive abilities? By neurotypical, I mean not gifted/ASD/ADHD. I know someone that is a top performer, that doesn’t imply that this person is gifted. But, i’ve noticed that this person has a great memory. And, this is seen with valedictorians etc. So can some valedictorians have a great working memory but pretty average other things? Like talking with some top performers, you can not but be sure that they are not gifted. They never questioned authority and they’re in university. That means a lot. One person lacks sympathy. I’m not saying they’re not smart. They actually are. But, at least they’re reasoning skills aren’t above average. Do you agree with me? They aren’t curious whatsoever. There are top performers that are curious and read lots of books and are high on sympathy. And, I am sure they’re above-average. But, some to me seem to just have a great memory.",0
"I need advice about emotional jams I'm a very joyfull and playfull person, childish ones could say. I can really feel almost spiritual emotions when I'm in the middle of a forest or countryside, admiring the beautiful and clever complexity of the puzzle of lives and laws that surrounds me. I can sense a supreme intelligence, beauty and love within everything including myself and my awareness and the huge emotions that I'm feeling in that moment. I think this supreme is God, because it feels like this.

Art makes me feel the same: it hits me and makes my bonds shiver in thrill, it brings tears to my eyes and relieve my soul... and yet my emotional potential is blocked and it hurts too much. I can sense I have a land of powerfull fire inside, a sun awaiting under the surface of a frozen lake... is scary somehow, but it's me and I want to set me free. Loads of bad experiences buried my heart into the soil, they built a dyke that is going to explote in the worst way.

I know the strenght of my emotions is wild: it feels like a violent force of nature (well, probably it is), a part of me wants to hide it because I feel this intensity can tear me apart or make me lose sanity. But I want to open the dyke's door to heal myself, to can really enjoy who I am before I die. The thing is no matter how much I try, I can't connect with it, I can't really open my heart to myself. 

Sometimes I'm very happy and in touch with myself, but as soonly as deep anxiety strikes I become amnesic-like about all the efforts I made and the stress numbs me horribly. I had fall countless times into the narrow dark well of numbness and sorrow, and I'm starting to be truly exhausted. I know my sould is strong enough to overcome these handicaps, but at times I forget about it for so long time.

I know the most of us must deal with this hell somewhen in our lives, that's why I wanted to know how you guys achievered to free and heal yourselves. What do you do to can open your heart and let your emotions out?",0
"Correlation between intelligence and altruism? I have no data to back this up, but concerning the state of the world, esp that of the US where I reside, it is hard to ignore the malevolence that seems perpetually awash in nearly every factor of our everyday lives. 

Personally, I've seen through experience that there seems to be a negative correlation between intelligence and generosity/kindness, that I'll label altruism here for the sake of defining it to one specific characteristic. 

Does anyone with a psychology, sociology, or other related background have any input on this theory?

I'm always looking for patterns, some way to help make sense of the world around me.

Edit: As many of you have pointed out, it's a positive correlation not negative. Thank you for correcting that, thats what I get for writing this at 2am :)

What I meant was I didn't want to make the assumption that simply bc one is smarter they are more generous, that seemed like quite a leap. But maybe some of you could verify that after all, and you have. 

But it seems to me that with the decline of intelligence, there is definitely a decline of generosity, and that is what I wanted to highlight.",0

"What is/are your framework(s) through which you view reality? In response to the confusion in the comments, I'm being more precise.

By framework, I mean a system that consists of the following things:

1. A set of assumptions about reality.
2. A set of inference rules.

The first covers the ontology, and the second covers the epistemology.

You needn't believe those assumptions and inference rules to be absolutely true or self-evident, but you must believe in them, otherwise, they aren't assumptions. The degree of which you believe in any given assumption will differ, and as such, this set could be divided into a subset of axioms you find self-evident, and a subset of assumptions you believe in but do not find self-evident.

These assumptions and axioms, and the inference rules, can be further split up into those that you are aware of, and those that you aren't.

You may then have a meta-framework. This puts the aforementioned framework and its contents into context. So, those assumptions that you believe in... do you believe that they're absolutely true? These are the questions your meta-framework answers.

**Example:**

John's framework is deductivo-empiricism, but he maintains the possibility that it might all be false, although such a possibility is ineffible to him. This is because he knows he may not ever absolutely know anything. As such, his meta-framework is pure agnosticism.

\_\_\_\_

You might be wondering how this relates to what I said about a framework being the system that ascribes meaning to experiences. See those comments if you haven't already, as they'll be helpful in understanding this part of the explanation.

So, experiences exist in one's sentience, and is observed by the consciousness. The sentient aspect is, with my definition of *meaning*, meaningless. It is just pure qualia. The conscious aspect consists of an identification and a contextualization; these processes are the consciousness making sense of the sentient aspect; it understands it as something in it of itself (identification, giving it its intra-essence) and something within everything else (contextualization, giving it its inter-essence).

And here's the relation with the aforementioned: the identification creates an assumption, and the contextualization either creates (an) assumption(s) and/or follows from the assumptions.

That's why I said your framework ascribes meaning to experiences. For every experience you've had, there's an assumption as to its identity, and there's either assumptions about that experience's place in reality, and/or its place in reality is derived from the other assumptions in your framework, that derivation following your inference rules.",0
"Is giftedness real/clinical? I'm in my late 20s. I recently became aware of ""giftedness"" through the Healthgamer Youtube channel. He basically described my entire experience growing up better than I ever could before. It felt like someone finally understood me for once, but to a scary degree. He described my thoughts and feelings. Parroted things people have told me repeatedly throughout my life. It even felt like it gave some sense to the things I do that others around me have always found strange. 

I delved in a little deeper. Now I find myself really excited to find out more about my own mind. I've done a lot of therapy and have been through a lot to get to where I am, but I still have always felt out of place in this world. However, I've been manipulated and burned  a lot. I grew up in the Christian church, and it took all of my being to rip myself from its claws. So now, while I'm a fairly open minded, I'm also a highly skeptical person. 

I haven't delved in too deeply, because I know I can get lost in it. But on a surface level google search, I couldn't seem to find anything concrete/clinically accepted by the mental health community. 

**So my question is** Is ""giftedness"" real? Or is it a theory that happens to identify broadly with a specific personality type? 

I'd appreciate any info/experiences or sources I can explore on this topic. Thanks! :)",0

Hello guys!
I’m no where gifted but i’m neurodivergent.
I have ADHD so i’m better at certain things than everything else.

Math and electrical engineering come naturally to me. I can directly apply and there isn’t a mess. But, when it comes to programming in python,
Sometimes I understand the problem differently and i solve a different problem and i always find a solution but it’s too complicated to put into code. Why does it not come naturally to me? Is it because it needs a big chunk of working memory? I felt that i as go forward i need a lot of what was learned before not in a conceptual sense but in an applied sense. But, how much reasoning does it need? Some people struggle with mathematics but seem to always score pretty high in programming exams. Does programming come naturally to some people? Does it need a simplified way of thinking? I always complicate solutions so it’s not pretty easy to put my thoughts into code. I put it and then Crash!

"Testing for 4 year old My son is 4 and will be turning 5 in a few months. I’m not sure if he’s gifted or just advanced for his age. 

He was able to read sight words before he 2 and books on his own before he was 3. He devours books and when given new books or at the library, he will sit and read for hours. He’s probably read over 300 books in the last 4 months. He has an amazing memory and vocabulary. He learned all the countries in the world and all 50 states when he was almost 4. He learned the names of over 50 dinosaurs and all sorts of facts about them. He knows more about space than most adults. He’s been able to do 40+ piece puzzles on his own since he was 2. He’s always been able to focus on something he finds interesting for long periods of time (e.g. reading an encyclopedia for over an hour) even at a very young age. 

As we begin to look for schools for Kindergarten and beyond, does anyone have any advice as to what to look for? Would having him tested be beneficial in any way? Is he too young? Who would do the testing?

I don't have big academic achievements however, I've always felt different from my peers. I've struggled all my life with interactions because of something seemingly non sizeable, however now I'm confident enough to say that it was about giftedness after a long time of reflections. I'm a very easy-going person, I like sports, music and artsy stuff. I really like open-minded people and hope to communicate with interested individuals anon. 
My dm's are open or say ""hi"" in the comments.

"The Curse of Being/Feeling Different The more I go on, and time passes by (by simply living my daily life for every single day it takes for it) I seem to be getting more and more easily the feeling of being misunderstood; of being not part of the ecosystem; of not being driven by something; or as much as the previous ones, of getting more mad day by day, year by year.


So, short life story:

(Now I'm 19)
I've always been afraid of being truly alone. Tho if I get it right, it has always been a part of me.
Metacognition (or simply put mental awareness) was a big part in the process of identification of my true (to the uppermost extent possible) self and in the process of development of my personality as of right now.
I've always been thinking about the fact that I was thinking upon a specific thought of a given topic. I've also been always surrounded by this strange feeling, of feeling an outsider, an alien: from one perspective it was because of a strange attention to a sort of ""field of view"" I still experience to this day in the way I describe it now or even in the way I lived it throughout childhood. This field of view I can explain as it being the space bounded by your eyes' limits through which you see the world; from the other perspective it was the mere thought of a typical solipsistic person: are the others real or are them the only projection of my thinking experience? Does this apply to everything else? Saying this 'cause I most often seem to fall back onto this thought process in peculiar, and it is debilitating...
Though the presence of some advanced traits of metacognition/mental awareness were there almost since from the start of it all (for me), I had know by the time I had gone through the death of my father, that something was missing, or oddly put in there.
My body was a mass of flesh, and all I was going through was the happening of some exterior forces to which I happened (and still happen to) to have no power of definition (of the events themselves).
Having been diagnosed with depression, and suddenly having had to start my medications journey - as for battling depression and similar issues themselves - have surely not helped me make me make contact with reality, 'cause I had by then become officially a ""mentally ill"" man, through which, in other ways - unexpectedly! - seemed to resonate the most!

Brief environmental description: born and still living in the center of Italy, I began my journey through life in this family of mine, which has obviously had a major role in the decision process of my most intimate traits of my own self - I am currently talking in the stage of life in which you are no more than a kid, innocent, a curious wonderer, and a nature and relationship seeker. So as for what happens in your life it surely does not fall under the obligation of being your fault. Whatever fault can mean. Here in Italy they say a small thingy to which in part I can address ""fault has been created by priests"" (since my home country is the home itself of Catholicism and my dear family and related known persons are highly religious).
Having to live with the fear of constant judjement because you hear your old ones taking care of their social status (if even they were any major or famous/notorious folks!) obsessively, and living under the denial of letting you escape your indoor reality to take a deep and MUST-TAKE breath of fresh air to make you just a little, play with possible future friends (by the age of 5 it became very difficult for me just on my own). This in exchange of lost in interest for the outside world, and a disgusting incapacity to relate to others in real terms of real life things-events, to the point of not making it out alive - if it was for me - to live without a starting point (of advantage) such as being economically stable-almost at the very least or having the fundamental traits of a charismatic person ready for all. And such.

I fear everything of this world. After my father's death (happening the 27th of December of 2016) I began slowly but surely, to not being able to express myself with all my needs and virtues - with something to offer on my own too maybe - and I suddenly felt down the abyss of existentialism, dropping all that have been left aside for me as a child in constant true-non-development, including moral values, ability to express, to feel happy, and to feel loved and love the others...
I am - to this day - still, a lost human.
No. I've come to the point in which I have dehumanised me, and am unable to seek or view possibilities of escaping this dark pit of despair in which I'm in. From time to time I experience mental breakdowns, which seem to make me progress through life-scenarios in worse than ever considitions... And I can't hide that I often think about suicide, not to make the others feel sad, but just for making it all vanished, hoping that somehow they'll be better (my family) even without me.
It has become a recurrent thought the one of suicide and not-strangely-enough, I don't view it as an anomaly. Tho I wished I were better...

I'm a 124-IQ brain on the spectrum of intelligence, and have been diagnosed a while ago with a lesser form of delusional psychosis.

There's still plenty to talk about but I feel like I've already said so much... Hope it is any useful (doubt it)...
Take care everybody!!

"I'm confused about my giftedness So about half a year after my primary school enrollment my teachers found that I was quite ahead of the other students my age and in turn I got an IQ test. The result pretty clearly said that I was gifted and therefore I got another half a year special tasks to foster my intelligence. Due to a lack of staff the program was cancelled and I never got further fostering neither in primary school nor in secondary (german equivalent to middle and high school). 

But still I was treated by the teachers and other students as highly intelligent. I never had to learn really which is a skill I lack now. People appreciated my for being so good at thinking and all the other stuff which got a pretty big part of my identity.

Fast forward: about a week ago another IQ test was presented to me which was a part of my ADHD testing. The thing: the result is in no way bad but technically I clearly can't be considered gifted now and that got me thinking. 

What happened to my intelligence and why did no one even myself noticed the decline?",0
"On My Giftedness, Learning Disabilities, Disappointment and Adulthood. I just want to share my journey in education after finding this subreddit. I hope some of you might read to the end. (Using throwaway fort this)

At five years old I was sent for IQ testing to the local university, as my Kindergarten teacher found me impulsive and disruptive. She truly believed I suffered from a degree of mental retardation. My parents found this very amusing, but I was tested, nonetheless. This was in the 1999-2000 school year. My Kindergarten teacher only taught that one year and then her contract was terminated. As it turned out, my IQ maxed out at 142. However, a battery of tests also revealed my development was uneven, and I was also severely dyslexic, ADD and learning disabled. I was told later that this put me on the autism spectrum, although I have never qualified for a diagnosis of autism proper. My parents were told I would never learn to read or write.

I am very fortunate that I was born into a loving middle-class family. My parents did not accept that and sent me to a speech and language pathologist who I saw several days a week after school. I don't remember not knowing how to read or having an a-ha! moment where everything clicked. I do remember activities I did to achieve this, but little else. By the third grade it was apparent I was somehow ahead of my peers in both writing, reading and science. I ceased seeing the pathologist in the fourth grade, but I will always be grateful to my parents and that women who gave me a future. At my school they started sending gifted children to a separate classroom for one hour a day to study more complex topics than were taught in our regular class environment. Mostly philosophy and mythology. To this day, 3 of the people I met there in that little room off the library in the fourth grade, are among my closest friends who I consider family, who I still regularly see to this day, even though we live in different places.

In middle and high school, they simply had gifted English/Writing classes. In regular classes and honors classes things were okay, but just okay. It was in high school though, that I noticed my gifted classes and AP classes were the only ones I felt comfortable and understood in. There weren't too many of us, and we became very close. I still speak with many of them today.

I realized at some point that I did this thing where I modified the way I speak and the things I speak about depending on whether or not I was talking to a ""gifted"" person or not and I still do something this. When I am myself and say what's on my mind, sometimes people stare at me like if I'm some alien. I thought this meant I was just an a\*\*hole except that my closest friends who were likewise gifted said they did the same. It is an unconscious thing now, It doesn't work like ""*well, I better talk stupid to these peasants*"" but more like ""*if I want people to like me and not want to punch me in the face, I better modulate what I say and how I say it*"".

Giftedness for me was a double-edged sword because it came with learning disabilities. I have always been weaker in math but an army of tutors helped me do well in those classes in school. I am one of those people who sometimes does not get it the way it is initially explained, but once I do get it, I master it.

I did not have the normal college experience that was expected of me. By my senior year of high school, I was going to and throwing a lot of parties and my friends and I drank heavily to help with the extreme anxiety I'd developed. I stopped putting effort into subjects I wasn't interested in and my grades suffered for it. By the time I graduated, I was bound for community college unlike my other gifted friends, who were offered scholarships to universities. The funny thing was, I wrote the admittance essays for two of these friends.

The drinking, partying and the anxiety followed me though. At community college, I did not go to class and I felt like everyone around me was an idiot. Really, it was me that was arrogant, most of these people worked hard and studied and went on to finish their degrees at universities. I dropped out and worked for the government doing secretarial work for years, but I was deeply unhappy during those years. I became extremely depressed and more anxious than ever and used my hyperfixations, common to those of us with ADD, to get by. I would sometimes try to go back to school, but found it hard because I had changed, I did not have the company of my closest friends who had flourished at university and my motivation had become so low. I felt hopeless. I perpetuated this cycle of working and quitting, trying to go back, quitting that, over and over again until I was 25 and suddenly, I realized I was old. This thought came from the ageism I had developed, though I now understand that aging is a gift not all of us who are born are lucky enough to experience.

In 2020, I decided to go back to school part time, one last time, to give everything I had. Then, the funniest thing happened that Spring. I lost my job like many did during those months, and I found myself having to move back in with my parents at age 25. My college switched to online only classes for a year and a half, and knowing myself and my weakness, I did not enroll in online classes because I felt I would be setting myself up for failure. Summer 2021 rolled around and in person classes began to be offered again and I enrolled then. I made a pact with myself that this was the end of the line, I could not go on like this and that school had to come before everything. So I went to every class, always on time, no more distractions. Studying and papers went first before any other thing. And finally, I did well. I made straight A's. I did it again this Spring and intend to do so again this Fall. I will be able to transfer to university at last and start there in Spring 2023.

I despise living off the generosity of my parents, but they insist that I should save my money for grad school and move out then. I still struggle with feelings of shame that my path has not been linear and that I caused grief to those who had high hopes for me. I am now 27 and I'm never going to be a doctor like they hoped, but if the world holds on and I work hard I will be a librarian and archivist, because that will make ME happy.

Giftedness was not a gift to me in the way I hoped it would be when I learned what it meant. It has made me isolated from avenues of camaraderie that might otherwise be open to me if I thought more in the way most people do. It gave me expectations of myself that I was doomed not to meet. Of the friends I still hold dear, none of them has had an even ride, even if they succeeded at university. One has depression and such a severe eating disorder, that I will be surprised should she live to see 35. One, though to someone like me a master of numbers, cannot pass her CPA exam because of her anxiety and is on the verge of declaring bankruptcy herself. The other is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic who is also trying to renter education. They all have serious relationship problems and always have. And all my friends who were not in the gifted program with me are happy. They have finished graduate school, they are getting engaged, buying houses, and starting families. I have to imagine this just how the cards were dealt, but I still find it a little ironic.

I have wondered if it is simply that we four were a group of miscreants within the gifted program growing up. But then I have heard from a few others over the years who were in it, some so successful on the surface, others not. I know my experience is not universal. Many people tested gifted and that was that. They have lived their lives with no disruption, able to communicate easily with all they meet and succeed at all they do, but this experience was not mine. For the younger among you, that does not mean it will be yours. But I might impart a word of advice if you have yet to figure it out: never tell anyone who does not ask that you are gifted or inform them what it means, it does not usually go well. IQ means nothing in the real world if you don’t have other tools at your disposal, whether they be mental health or support system related. It is easy for people like us to get lost in ourselves and allies are important for those of you who think and feel deeply.

You might think my story useless or believe that since I struggled, I never belonged in gifted, but if anyone out there can relate or learn something from this, then I will consider it a good thing.",0
"I'm going through some mental ""crisis"" and need some thoughts and pointers  

Okay so I wanna start by saying this is gonna be a huge rant and list of mental symptoms and behaviors that I've always been biased about and have started to kinda of concern me. Some affect my daily life, while others don't are are just ""because I do this does it mean I have that"" type things.

I know I need some sort of mental help but I don't know what kind. I don't know where to start, what to look for, and to be honest I just don't have the mental stamina to go alone and trial and error all of this, let alone all the money it'll cost.

Maybe someone that reads this has some knowledge on what I say, maybe someone has personals experience. I don't know. But im looking for opinions and pointers to the right direction.

But yeah, its basically gonna be a scattered list of notes from here on.

I have super bad anxiety. My entire life I would obsess and fear over bodily health, mental health, and others peoples health.

Im a hypochondriac, I am too sensitive to what happens to my body, I panic if I don't have a direct answer to why I am feeling what I feel. I hyper analyze my mental and physical state to make sure everything is ""up to code"" and if its not I need a rationalize logical reason or I panic thinking im sick and dying.

I chase adrenaline but then I suffer from it. I love scary stories, fear excites me. But then it causes panic. For example, I love creepy pastas, horror stories, ghost sightings, and scary explorations during the day, but at night it hits back. I cant sleep, all I can think about is dragging back some kinda attachments or ghosts and panic all night.

I get very obsessed with things very quickly but usually drop them after a couple weeks and sometimes it re sparks.

I got obsessed with learning the guitar every summer for 3 years and completely drop it 2-4 weeks in. I watch videos, I read, I spend money on maintaining and upgrading, and I genuinely do practice, but in a few weeks it just dies out.

I randomly with obsessed with pens. My explanation is that they're cheap and theres almost an endless amount of options to choose from so whenever Im bored I can drop like 30-50 bucks on a handful of pens and just test the out see which ones I like and dabble around for a few hours.

I've had similar obsessions with skateboarding, hoodies, long sleeve shirts, jeans, caps, shoes, sticky notes, mechanical pencils, journals, gaming mice, mouse pads, alcohol, video games, books, headphones, keyboards, music making, film making, recording and editing software, bikes, camping, hiking, swimming, going to the gym, songs.

Basically anything that has options and variations, I feel like I need to compare all possible options and test them and pick out the very best one.

It also happens with shows and movies. If the show clicks with me I'll develop rushes on the characters, real or fiction, I'll become obsessed with the world and story and lore.

Happens with real life people too. I develop these super intense crushes on people I literally barely even know and just obsess and think ONLY about them from like a couple weeks to a couple months.

Sometimes they're sexual/romantic other times they aren't. I had a huge Johnny Knoxville phase. Im not gay I just thought the dude was so incredibly cool and all could do was research and watch all his content for a while.

As much as it happens with mostly positive things it also happens with bad things. I obsess over little symptoms I have, headaches, dizziness. I sometimes focus only on my weight and worry when it fluctuates thought the day. I've focused on my body temp and just been measuring it all day for weeks. I've focused and panicked over m heart rate for a month. I focus over my mental health and mental illness. It always comes and goes in waves like every other month I'll just remember all my quirks and start googling and then get all biased with my quirks and actual symptoms. I feel like Im constantly monitoring and checking and testing my physical and mental sensations and quirks.

I fidget a lot. I dont know if its stimming or what but I walk around the house when im bored and restless. Kinda pace since there isn't much room to walk. I dont know if its the repetition of pacing that feels nice or if its just the movement that feels nice. I sometimes clap out of boredom, I whistle and hum, I jump and bob around my chair. I fidget with my fingers or little Knick knacks. I wiggle my legs/ feet/ fingers. I sometimes make sounds or noises when Im bored or when im like concentrating and enjoying myself.

The dark always disorients me super bad. I think its something about not being able to see my surroundings, but the dark disorients everything and makes me panic.

My eyes sometimes like just get tired or something and do this weird thing where they get sensitive to light or something? Like it usual happens when im reading white words on a black background. My eyes just do this weird thing where they feel like more sensitive or something.

I struggle with eye contact. Its not too bad when Im listening but when Im talking its hard to look at someone's eyes while thinking of what I have to say without losing track. I think its because i know they're looking at me so there's extra pressure to not mess up and when I do mess up I know they are judging me.

I pay attention to peoples mouth a lot, probably more than their eyes. Again maybe Im being biased because I read about this being an autism symptom and Im scared of having it but mouths are really interesting to watch for some reason. The lips, the chin area, the teeth, theres a lot of variation and detail. But a lot of the time peoples eyes are kinda boring and just too static. Some people have nice pretty eyes and nice eyelids and eyebrows that are interesting to watch but yeah. mouths are more dynamic.

I was always shy and awkward. I struggle talking to people because m mind goes blank and im too worried about how they see me and what they think of me.

Again might be biased because I read about ""masking"" but when Im at my truest self I am very loud and expressive and quirky. I might come off as dumb because I act before I think. I stutter, I stumble, I say dumb things, I over react, I over exaggerate. If anyone's watched the streamer XQC Im kinda like that when I feel at my best.

But when im out in public I become a shell because I know its overbearing and too much and too weird so I try to like be ""normal"" I guess by muffling myself and being calm. It still stresses me out because Im so worried about making a good impression. But I cant because Im too nervous.

When I was younger I'd need to warm up to people first. Like Id be all shy and quiet but after a few mins I would pop out of my shell and be all happy go lucky. but now as an adult its just sad.

I need time to prepare myself to social events. Even if its with close friends. I dont know why but I feel nervous when meeting good close friends. I guess part of me still thinks they'll judge me or maybe like Im faking my happiness/energy and Im not really lkie that in real life? Maybe I expect them to expect me to be at 100% all the time and if im not I feel like I let them down?

I thought maybe im an introvert but I still really like being around people. I like noisy busy environments and I like crowds. I dont really like interacting with them, but I like being part of them. I dont like being alone because it drains me and usually makes me sleepy or regress to negative internal thoughts and feelings.

I had a big fear of being left alone. I couldn't go to school alone (not sure how long but maybe to like 1st grade?) and would freak out if I didn't see her at the store, I also couldn't sleep alone at night for years.

I sometimes get what I think is sensory overload where im suddenly just like more aware of everything around me. This ""filter"" randomly wears off and everything is more open and im more aware. It doesn't cause me to freak out but its just a bit jarring and weird. This happens a lot when its dark because I lose my orientation of whats around me.

Fluorescent lights are annoying to me. Again not sure if this might be normal but I really dont like them and its shocking to me why they're so popular. Like They don't make me run away screaming but they make everything feel so un home-y and so sterile and hospital-y. Why would you want that.

I write down way too much. Its like a fear of forgetting something important or something so im always writing tons of thoughts and ideas down. I have journals, sticky notes, phone memos, word docs, google docs, just filled and scattered all over my room.

I write down bad thoughts to keep them out of my head, I write down symptoms to keep track of them, I write down nostalgias to not forget them, I write down goals and general wants.

I have bad intrusive thoughts that cause me huge destress and directly impact some decisions I make in real life. Like if I think something bad on a piece of food I have to throw it away so I dont get sick or something.

I am always chasing nostalgia and get super depressed because it never feels the same.

For some reason I've always thought there was something wrong with me physically or mentally. Im always searching and comparing and checking symptoms trying to find something. I dont even now if I have anything but I keep searching.

My parents and teachers always said I was fidgety and jumpy as if I was running on a motor, and my parents always threatened me will calming pills but never did anything about it. I was always good about getting my school work done but I kinda hit a wall in 11th grade. Everything just got super boring and I couldn't really keep up. Even in college shit was just boring or too complicated, Like chemistry, business, economics, and that were math psychology ""if this then that"" crap. Too many numbers and rules.

Right now im struggling because im only focusing on bad mental and physical symptoms. On one hand I understand that MOST of what I feel is cause due to mental stress but I still cant stop obsessing over them.

I also struggle to start things. I have so many plans and ideas but its almost impossible to push myself. The only motivation I get are there random manic like bursts that last maybe like an hour but then I lose all interest again.

I also have weird mood shifts. One moment im manic, feeling good and energized, the next im kinda sad, fatigued, weak, and bored.

damn this got long. Im tired. I literally sat here for like an hour just thinking and writing. If anyone's made this far props to you!

if anyone has questions or wants me to add something more I will be happy to. I know there's so much more but I'm just done.

Thanks to anyone that comments their opinions or pointers!",0

"Letting down your manipulative therapist So basically i went to therapy for the first time, and she immediately identified me as having ""arborescent thinking"" which was pretty much a euphemism for gifted. 

And then she immediately started saying things with uncommon words testing my vocabulary. I don't consume much media in french so i didn't get the meaning of what she said (making me feel bad), and when i called her out on her impromptu IQ test, she denied it.

Does she lack the self awareness to see what she was doing, or is she gaslighting me?",0

"Misunderstood. Being misunderstood is common for gifted individuals, so I hope some of you can relate to my experiences. 

About a week ago at work, I worked with my lead and the guy they're training to be lead. One of them had commented, ""you seem like a pretty intelligent guy,"" and they had already offered for us to get breakfast together like, say, friends. I figured, if we're going to be friends and they already think I am intelligent, perhaps I should open up about my giftedness. I attempted to explain it, and my lead said: ""I don't know what that means, but it sounds cool, so that is good, I guess."" I didn't even bother to explain anymore, and I'll likely never mention it again.

I also made a post on a question-based subreddit that asked, ""why are you still single?"" I offered a few things and then submitted my giftedness, explaining that my unique hobbies and interests make it hard to find a partner. I wouldn't say I like smoking, drinking, sports, going out, etc., but I enjoy particle physics, neuroscience, and psychology. I went on to state, ""I am not superior to anyone in any way, I am simply different, and this difference creates a life-long struggle to find a connection."" I received a reply stating that my post screamed of a typical college freshman. That I believed my intelligence made me superior and would remain that way until I got a real job or got further into a degree. Of course, many agree with him on this matter, but in reality, I do not think I am superior to anyone. 

I so badly want a deep and personal connection. I crave and yearn to be understood. If having lower intelligence enables me to find suitable partners more *easily*, then, by all means, take my intelligence away. I am not superior to anyone -- I am different.",0
"Does any one of you struggle to find meaningfulness? This struggle is overwhelming to me. What can I do ? Hi,

Sorry in advance for the following depressing vent but I just don't know to whom to ask this. Also, English isn't my mother tongue so I'll try to write the best I can.

I am having trouble to adjust to my very recent diagnosis of being gifted and ADHD. I mean in a 2ay it brought relief at first to finally know why I had struggle all my life to fit but it also down on me that there is no way to ""fix"" it and that the struggle will continue.

The problem is, I am exhausted to struggle. I am a 39yo woman who has work tirelessly since I was at school, I had no issues with academics but I didn't want to work too much on the boring stuff. I went to University, got my degrees, then I move abroad to start over, got a job in what I loved doing, I've been working in this field for 15 years now. I Still love what I am doing but I hate the way we do it. Globally. I hate the normative Monday-Friday 9-to-6 every week, all year long. It doesn't make sense to me.

I've been trying to fit for so long that I burnt out at 34. Took some time to heal, went back to worked, tried to do it differently by putting more boundaries but still here I am again at 39 and my second burn out.

This is went I got my diagnosis of ""twice exceptional"". Which apparently usually comes with a quest for meaning in what we do (said my therapist).

But I just feel stuck and empty. I am just tired to fight to manage to fit into society at the cost of my well being. Yet I have no idea how to listen to my own needs on that matter as I can't find any meaning 8n a lot of things.

For instance working. I am a hard worker, but the way we, as a society, work is utter nonsense to me. Being asked to work more for wages barely allowing us to be able to fulfill any life project we might have like having kids, traveling, having a house or start a business or just live off the grid or whatever that is.

I am at a point in my career where I have a very good salary, I budget and take car of my finances and still I find the cons of working the way we do overweights the pros. The cost in free time is too high. We could have used our technological progress to help us, human, to have more free time to live, but no, instead we are squeezed to the last drop then tossed aside and replaced by young lemons that only know they want to do lemonade without understanding it will cost them greatly.


I have always been a down-to-earth person that love to dream about a lot of stuff, I have to s of project ideas flying by constantly in my head but I don't find any meaning in the thought of making them becoming actual projects in real life.

I don't see the point, it seems small and just shallow. Another gadget, another way of entertainment, another ""thing"" that will be forgotten soon and just takes place for nothing. It doesn't help people or make our world better.

Then I think at activities and project to actually help people or trying to make the world better and even though I like the idea behind these thoughts, I can't help but to feel it is also meaningless because it would take so much than one person to actually make a difference even though one person is always better than none. 

I am lost, I am supposed to got back to work in a month, after a 6 months break to reflect about all of it but I don't even know if I can still do any work in any field given that I will still struggle to find a way to make ""their"" way work for me. I am looking at doing something else, something that matters to me, that has more meaning to me, and even though I am interested in so much topics , I cannot for the love of me find a single thing that brings meaning. I just don't know what to do.

What if I am broken and cannot work or do stuff anymore?
Why can I not find meaning is anything? Am I so arrogant that everything is beneath me ? Not big enough? Not meaningful enough? I've never been like that, I don't get me right now.

Did you struggle to find meaning because of your giftedness? If so what changes did you do ? How did you find what mattered the most and how to make it real ?

If you reach this point, I thank you for reaching me, this is really nice of you.",0
"OCD/ADHD and relation with giftedness? Hi everybody. I’m not a native english speaker so sorry for my bad english. I just wanted to ask a couple questions regarding my life. I’m a 23 y old guy with OCD. This disorder was very severe during childhood but, as I grew up, I started losing obsessions or caring about some of them and I would say that my biggest obsessions regard now studying (I cannot read a page and go to the next one without knowing practically every single word in that page. Apart from this, I have been told, especially in the last couple years (by friends and family) that I very often seem not to pay attention to what they are saying, keep on moving and cannot stand still. A friend suggested I could have ADHD, I searched for the symptoms and saw myself in almost every behaviour of people with ADHD. But, isnt it weird not to have been diagnosed till the age of 23? And can it have sth to do with giftedness? (Also for this, I wasn’t diagnosed by a psychologist, so dont know at all if i may be gifted. I passed the mensa entrance test and scored in the 130-140 interval in almost every online test I took (the ones with higher correlation with WAIS). So, apart from the questions I asked, do u think getting tested (WAIS or ADHD testing) may be useful or do u know other people (possibly gifted) in the same situation? Sorry for having been lenghty. Thanks.",0

"Spatial ability is neglected As Lubinski and Kell (2013) found, spatial ability is a neglected field. Many talented individuals finish school and even college without recognizing their gift. Spatial ability is useful across many industries, such as architecture, physics, surgery, sport, military and law enforcement. Attempting these tests will assist me in developing a reliable spatial test to allow individuals with this skill to realize their potential. Any feedback is welcome.

"Taming giftedness? Since I stopped trying to be someone else and doing stuff I am interested in I encountered a similar problem as before. 
It was definitely the right move, because the positive effect is my overall happiness increased drastically. 
Trying not to write a wall of text 
, the problem is: Doing things I want to requires a level of discipline, like having a routine. And I have a really hard time with routines, but when I stick to them for a week, like sticking to sleeping habits, meditation, learning to code and other stuff my general happiness is peaking. 
But too often my brain is bringing me to video games and other addictions  (non physical) that fog my brain and just doing nothing all day. 

So would you guys say having a certain level of discipline is a necessary evil for fulfillment and happiness or am I missing something ?

"Who are the happy, successful gifted people? Redditors have pointed out that this sub is kind of negative, and that gifted people here seem to dislike their giftedness.

So... who do you think the truly happy gifted people are? I think the happier gifted people are the ones who enjoy and do well in academia. I can do academia, but I hate it. I got to a point where I could no longer suppress my true interests anymore. I like seminars, and I like to take some continuing education classes, but I dont want to be in a 'real' school environment ever again. 

This may ruffle a few feathers, but I think gifted people who follow the standard, dare I say stereotypical path get more acceptance, support, and love. 

When people think of smart person, they see dorky spelling bee winner or Steve Urkel. They don't see Dolph Lundgren, who is basically a rocket scientist. When you step outside the box, it can cause a lot of problems. 

Many of my interests are nonacademic. Im very active, and I enjoy sports and being physically fit. I also tested as gifted in high school. I won't go into one of my rants, as anyone can look up my post history here of in r/aftergifted. Im in my 30s, and people still try to shove me into some little box. I don't like school anyway, but I dont see any way out but abject academic failure. I don't want to be smart if it's at the expense of everything else about me. 

In short, I think gifted people who dont like school, dont want to go into Stem, don't want fancy job are less happy.",0
"Identity and purpose Everything around me seems so slow and frustrating. I can't understand how people can put up with 8h repetitive boring jobs or abusive conditions (dissociation I guess). To be honest I dont understand how they put up with any situation that lasts more than 5 minutes. I have a constant desire for purpose and stimulation, sometimes even wishing to stand up and run away, scream and destruct what's near me. 

Emotions are very intense, stress, anxiety and constant introspection. Often, it feels like time is slowed down, and in spite of this, sometimes I am so absorved in something that the passage of time becomes huge leaps of hours.

I have tactile hypersensitivity and feel uncomfortable every second of every hour of my day. I cannot focus on anything.

Neither can I work, specially not if the job is not fulfilling or has a purpose for me. Hypersensitivity and flat feet makes it really hard. Just imagining a full time job makes me wanna kill myself.

I hate society every day. I hate listening to tv, the need for words and predefined social standards, the shallowness, the unfairness and stupidity of everything. In the other hand, calmness is marvelous. 

To love and to feel, learn and think. My dream is to do something to help others or to make the world a better place, but also to find my comfort and joy. If I could connect with somebody and get rid of this loneliness I would be the happiest person. I also like instrumental music or music in general. Or sometimes just the sounds of the environment, feeling the wind, and contemplating my surroundings.

When I was a kid I loved documentaries and drawing was my passion, since it allowed me to imagine and observe, which I did very well. I had plenty of energy and curiosity, and wanted to change the world. There were no signs of social anxiety, addiction or any other issue that came afterwards. Unfortunately, my parents were abusive and I never connected with anyone.

I feel prisoner of my own body and society. The therapist believes I am autist but I am sure I am not. The doctor believes I am hypocondriac. Expressing myself and communicating is difficult for me.

I don't know the purpose of this thread, I guess it's just narcissism or the wish of being understood. You may think what does this all have to do with giftedness. The thing is two years ago I learnt about the concept of double exeptionality and felt identified with it. What do you think about all this?",0

"Giftedness and class perspectives I don’t know exactly where I’m going with this, I have three half thoughts in my head but I am hoping at the end that this will all make sense. 

I have in the past year become more aware that I am experiencing an inner conflict related to giftedness and class.
I grew up working class (relatively poor) but with access to books and culture, and the expectation that I would succeed academically (although I was more artistically inclined myself). This eventually let me to a place where the ideal of [bildung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildung) was held in high esteem. I received a good education but by this education I was also granted access  into a world where the expectations relating to culture and manners, and the ideas of what had value and not, were far removed from those of my upbringing. 

I have since found my way back to a more creative and grounded existence, but I carry with me some of the elements of the intellectual bourgeoisie that I value, and some that I don’t but have internalized. Basically trying to disentangle myself from the snobbishness of a certain societal strata. 

This might be a European thing, but I have the feeling that giftedness is linked to snobism. Some things are not “bon goût” (good taste). You’re not supposed to enjoy certain music/ books, dress a certain way etc. It’s taken me some time to realize that this is bullsh*t and I am proudly reclaiming whatever I like and also pride in my cultural and class background however it’s an ongoing project. I am also discovering that the classic European epistemology and methodology is not the be-all end-all I was educated to believe, and this is a great relief as it did not hold the space for my own cultural and ethnic background. 

Okay now I’ve gotten this far, I think I’ve managed to get most of my thinking into writing. So now I guess I am curious to know about your own journeys with regards to class and giftedness? Or any general thoughts on the subject? Is it possible to disentangle giftedness and education from a classist dimension, and if yes, what would that look like?",0
"Just found out I have an IQ of 150. Not sure how to feel about it. I'm keeping this anonymous because I don't want anyone to know who I am. I know some people might think I am fishing for compliments or something but believe me I get enough of those and I hate it. I'm also rational enough to know that compliments aren't what I would get by posting this. I really don't want this to come off as braggy; I just have a problem, and I don't know anyone who can genuinely relate to it.

In retrospect it makes sense. I had always assumed my IQ was around 125-130, and because I have a slew of mental disorders and was developmentally delayed it seemed to fit. I would always stand out in any situation for my ability to pick up and master anything I tried, and for the longest time I simply assumed it was because I was the only person that really tried at things. Now I realize that may not have been so true. I still struggle in school because I can't force my attention to something that isn't engaging. It's not that I don't care. My eyes glaze over and I can't read the words. I have struggled with stimulant medication my whole life and due to the side effects I am taking a dose that is an order of magnitude lower than what I took growing up. But I'm making my way through a math and physics double major. It is by no means easy for me, primarily because I chose to forgo the necessary medications, and as such I feel like I have to reread every part of a textbook dozens of times because I can't silence my internal dialogue while I read. Last semester I spent nearly all my time studying and repeatedly burned myself out to the point where I struggled to think clearly or read at all for 4 days leading up to my finals. I love reading about physics but that doesn't mean I'm not exceptionally slow when it comes to homework - but I digress. 

In recent years I have started to access my full potential in my interests. I haven't changed anything but I have been contacted by the local media for an artistic piece of hyperrealism, even though it was my 4th try drawing in that medium, and I never had that ability before. I assume it is because in art classes in school, time was the major constraint. I am an incredibly slow thinker, and slow to do pretty much everything in life. Now that I have the freedom to rigorously explore my surroundings, I find that the flow states I feel in my hobbies connect to each other and it makes learning completely new and abstract activities to be unreasonably simple. I never meant to excell so much in these areas. 

I am likely autistic and have uncontrollable hyperfixations that render me incapable of doing anything else until I finish a masterpiece in whatever it is I happen to be interested in at the time (masterpiece is subjective, I mean it as in I finish something to the extent that I personally don't think any part of it could be improved to my liking - its an obsessive need to completely and holistically realize that which I desire). Growing up I would build robots and watch space documentaries, but it feels like my learning curve in recent years has accelerated far, far beyond what I ever thought I was capable of. You'd think I would enjoy living like this, like it would feel like I am in a TV show. But all I feel is confusion.

I am so glad my parents hid my IQ from me and still provided me with the necessary materials to learn, and made sure I had close friends who were also incredibly gifted. It gave me a beautiful social network and allowed me to spread my wings. 

Don't get me wrong - I enjoy being smart and capable of pursuing any of my dreams, even with my severe executive limitations. But I don't feel smart. I'm not depressed about it either. For some reason I feel existentially scared. Scared that maybe I am just that unique. It would render me alone in the way I experience and process the world around me. I had been developing a concern for this in recent months and in searching for a psychiatrist I found a psych evaluation and confronted my parents about it. I get that I shouldn't feel any different but I do. What scares me is the statistic of my intelligence being 1/2500. 

I don't feel like I did anything to deserve this. And I'm angry that other people don't get to experience what it is like. I can't imagine not being able to see the things that I can see, to be able to just figure out how to solve a rubiks cube on my own or pick up photorealism in under 100 hours when it takes people decades. Why me? Why can't I live in a world where everyone around me is smarter, where I feel like everyone around me has wisdom to offer, where I'm not the one explaining concepts and ideas all the time, where all my interactions aren't just people feeling bad about themselves for not being able to do what I do. 

I am obsessed with philosophy and existentialism, the interrelation between temporality and conciousness, quantum field theory, gravity and cosmology, neuroscience and the essence of reality. And I look around and nobody else lives their lives like I do. I don't think I'm better than anyone else; my intelligence is undeserved and has nothing to do with who I am as a person. But I am secretly, and existentially terrified that other people simply are not capable of experiencing reality the same way I do. I am terrified that I am not capable of experiencing reality the way they do. I assume everyone has this problem though, at least to some extent.

I just want to know how I should feel about this. The past few months feel like I've been discovering that I'm genuinely gifted, that I have been given a gift that is not just rare but paired with my privelege in life, it doesn't seem real. My life now seems too special to be true and I am confused because I want to be normal and I don't want to be special. I just want to fit in and be on equal footing with my peers and to know that finding like minded people will forever be incredibly rare really, really scares me. If there is anyone else on here who has experience with this, please feel free to reach out.

I just hope I'm not wasting my potential. And I hope I can find some way to pay what I feel I owe back to the society around me. I don't want my intelligence to just be a series of party tricks that make people secretly feel bad about themselves.

I'm alright its just - everything suddenly feels so weird...",0
"Gifted struggles: dealing with lack of empathy in non-gifted people. So I’m not sure if this is related to my giftedness or not but it seems like I push many people away when they hear me voice my opinions or talk about life in general. I was even called “extreme” and crazy by people online and in real life. I also noticed that most people only have empathy when they or their family members experienced something. I feel like a college student being put in a room full of 1st graders. 

I feel like the average person is either dumb or cold and it makes me not wanna deal with anyone and it makes me feel frustrated and lonely and also resentful. I mean don’t get me wrong I’ve seen a handful of smart/high empathy people but I feel like there’s too little to make a difference. I see so many people being so chill and laidback about lots of twisted shit and it makes me feel like my high sensitivity is a curse. 

Ignorance is bliss for sure, I resent them for their ability to go about their day without letting things get to them, while things take a toll on my physical and mental health. What should I about this cognitive dissonance that I’m experiencing? I’m complaining about these people and wanting to be like them at the same time it just doesn’t make any sense. How do I come to terms with my sensitivity and how can I deal with the fact that I’m surrounded by aholes? Also I’d love to hear your story if anyone feels the same way as I do.",0

"Collapsed? Understimulated? ADHD? *I feel like I'm going in circles and it's driving me insane!*

I used to be able to do an insane amount of things in high school while keeping a 4.0, even in A.P. and college classes. I did all that, was in band, jazz band, theater, football, basketball, lifting, orchestra, I started and ran my own club and grew it to 182 members, I was a National Honors Society Officer, I did all of it, and then I crashed due to an ex girlfriend who convinced me I'm depressed, and I got on zoloft for a year, and haven't been able to do that much since. I'm currently 23,  didn't do more than a semester of college due to no money and horrible mental health, and I've been working but being burned out at the end of the day. But anyway, I think maybe it's ADHD because I did everything last minute in high school, my dad has it, and my closest friends have it.

&#x200B;

**Maybe I'm just a collapsed gifted adult:**

* I got tested as gifted in elementary school and kept a 4.0 until I got a B in 11th grade while taking college credit courses and dozens of extracurriculars and working multiple part time jobs
* I have an excellent working memory  (I can memorize most of a chapter before a test and ace a test)
* I can focus on things I'm interested in
* I have periods where I can force myself to do things I'm not interested in.
* I can understand really complex material quickly and teach it to somebody
* I can get obsessed about something for a few months and read like 300 books on it and then get bored of it and not bring it up anymore
* I could create really cool things with little preparation until after highschool
* I could pick up skills really quickly until after high school
* I'm a super patient person and can be calm
* I can respond to people really quickly and be witty most of the time while doing a lot

&#x200B;

**Maybe it's gifted + ADHD:**

* I get burned out at the end of the workday even though it's an easy job
* I spent 5 years trying to go to college but I can't figure out how to make the money work without being in a ton of debt
* I've been using caffeine to regulate my ability to pay attention to boring things, and to regulate my emotions
* I used to have this constant dialogue in my head of like 2-8  different streams of thought at once moving rapidly (until I learned how to slow it down with a book I read)
* I've always been terrible at time in general. I'm nearly always late STILL at 23.
* I usually feel the most peaceful when there's a lot going on around me or when it's chaotic and I need to solve a crisis
* I keep looking at my phone and have trouble actually doing anything else with my day (like 8 hours a day).
* I'm very impulsive with money when it comes to buying food
* I have a lot of trouble cooking and focusing on how to make different things
* I've been pretty much a failure at everything I've tried that I either wasn't super excited for
* I know if I get really into something, I'll obsess over it and I won't sleep and I'll just stay up until it's like 5am and I'm falling asleep in my chair, so I haven't been doing anything exciting because otherwise I'm at a much greater risk of dying since I drive a lot for my job.
* I use a plan of hanging out with friends, coffee, imminent deadlines or other exciting things to help me get energized for something that would be torture to do otherwise (cleaning dishes, doing homework, taking a shower, etc)
* I'm usually either very anxious or depressed without a lot of things to do at the same time, or without caffeine (only 300mg per day)
* My dad has adhd, and same with all my closest friends growing up.
* A lot of people in high school thought I was on weed due to my random thinking
* I know that if I didn't have to worry about when I slept and could have food and water and shelter, I'd work on things nearly all the time in sprints of my different interests and create things like I did in high school

&#x200B;

I've done a ton of research and basically just keep going in circles over the past few months. 

PLEASE read this and help me with my predicament.

Also: I got diagnosed with ADHD a few weeks ago, but I'm not confident it was accurate because it was only over an hour, on a day where I only had 5 hours of sleep and drank a coffee about 20 minutes before, and they asked me 92 questions about how often I experience symptoms more than other people I know on a 1-4 scale. Which for me doesn't work well because most of my friends growing up had it, so I can't compare the frequency to them, and my dad has it, and my mom is kinda nuts (BPD) and my little brother, and my newest closest friend both have asperger's. So I compared it to my friend with mild aspergers, and scored a 3 on nearly everything, with some 1s and some 4s.",0

about two years ago, i became very involved in scientific research, which i genuinely loved (and still do). this was mainly during covid.

learning and engaging in research calms me, bc it addresses all the deeper mental stimulation that i yearn for. at the same time, i feel like it isolates me from really living in the moment in my everyday life. i mean, at the end of the day, im still a normal teenager. i still wanna do dumb shit like sneaking out late at night and drinking white claws with friends at bonfires or asking out the girl i like (who is the very opposite of intelligent and deep), cuz im only going to be in high school once but my academic career awaits me for the rest of my life.

I even got bullied in secondary school and had a psychological monitoring put in place, but it never came to their mind that I might be gifted. A few years later, and I'm dropping out of high school, slowly drifting into loneliness, and yet, despite all the evidence, nobody considers giftedness.

I simply don't know what's next, what to do, how to do it, how to start believing in life again, how to get out of this seemingly unescapable prison.",0
"Dealing with Obsessions & Traversing faults in logic My current view associates everything with mental illness, it's illogical. It seems the goal of everything I do, is to prove that I am currently experiencing mental illness, I am unable to relax or think freely, as I associate that action with mental illness. It's tough to explain, but it feels like the end destination of every thought, feeling, and action. It doesn’t matter what it is, math, science, English, everything becomes a mental illness. I’m aware that it’s illogical, but it makes it hard to move past it, as you guessed it, moving past this to me is a sign of mental illness. I’m currently at an impasse. This fault in logic is the only suffering im experiencing, and I cannot seem to let it go. Its become an obsession that has taken over every facility of my existence.

I’ve spent hundreds of hours talking with a psychiatrist, and have been reassured I’m not mentally ill, but this keeps prodding at me. She made me aware that I was highly gifted in psychology and philosophy,  among other things.  This seems hard to accept, and I feel like an imposter.

I’ve lost my interests, and my drive for life due to this, it's the worst thought loop in existence. 

If you were in this situation, how would you get out of it?",0
"Is this giftedness or 2e, or neither? So a few years back I was given the WAIS IV, and scored a 121 in my FSIQ. Also, when I was a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD. My verbal comprehension index was 130, with a 13 on similarities, and a 16 on both vocabulary and information. My PRI was 115, with a 14 on matrix reasoning, and a 12 on both block design and visual puzzles. My WMI was the lowest, with a 95, and a 7 on digit span, and an 11 on arithmetic. My processing speed was 124, with a 17 on symbol search, and a 12 on coding. 

I have always felt like an outsider. My interests as a child ranged from astronomy, anatomy, weather, geography, and history. I also enjoy the arts (drawing and painting). When I was diagnosed with ADHD, I was 6 years old. The story, to make it short, was this: In my school there was a library, and I liked searching the books there and getting copies of the sections I wanted to keep for myself to read. It came to the point where I would lie to the teacher about going to the restroom, only to go to the library. As time passed, staff got worried, as the school was poorly fenced and they feared I would leave and get lost. This was in Mexico back in the 90s. One day, I spoke to my English teacher about the differences between whales, dolphins, and fish, and how their tails differed, and how the former were not fish, but mammals. I had watched the 1996 Pinocchio movie when I was like 4, so when I saw the whale, I became obsessed with marine life and learned what I could about it. But my English teacher, not knowing that, called my parents, concerned that I didn't have a childhood, and that they were pushing me too hard and should make me watch cartoons instead. Little did she know that I was the one asking my parents for information, books, and objects such as terraqueous globes (these latter were because of Toy Story 1, when Buzz Lightyear was thrown out by a globe. Me being a kid I just wanted one of those and wanted to read the capitals and the country names. I eventually became famous for ""knowing the capitals of the countries"" at 3), and I got into space because of Toy Story and Star Wars, and into the body because of Magical School Bus! Cartoons were my gateway to these areas. 

But that was not the end of this odyssey. My dad had spoken to me about this character from Mexican history named ""El Pipila"", who stormed a fortress back in the war of independence, carrying a slab of stone, and a torch. I made a drawing of that during class, and because they were fed up with me, I was taken to the office, where the psychologist from the school saw the drawing and interpreted it as me being a pyromaniac, even though I had no interest in setting fires. My parents obviously disagreed with this diagnosis. So the school gave us an ultimatum: we had to get a diagnosis before Thanksgiving, if not, I was to be expelled. So my parents took me to a real psychologist, who after doing some tests, determined I had ADHD. Apparently, she could not administer the WISC correctly because I couldn't sit still, so she had to section it in different sessions. According to my mom, I scored a 140, but had difficulties concentrating and with impulsivity. And I ended up getting expelled because the school said they did not have the resources to accommodate a kid like me. 

Fastforward to me being 11, and I get another test, where I score a 120. And then when I was 23-24, I scored a 121, with the details I wrote in the first paragraph. 

That early experience marked me, as I felt like a reject. And it made me develop this love-hate relationship with school. I liked academics, but distrusted staff. I always felt like I would get in trouble for being me (which happened often throughout my childhood). But I fought hard to overcome that. I eventually went to college, majored in psychology. Finished a masters, and now I am doing a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. 

Some time on 2013, I learned about 2e. The profile fit like a glove. I feel like my strengths sometimes masked my weaknesses, and other times the opposite, leading to me falling through the cracks.",0
"How is your social life? I noticed something interesting about myself today. I was wondering if anyone else can relate. 

I think about some of my work friends a whole lot more than anyone else. Am I attracted to them? Not really. After thinking about it, I can be super nerdy and they actually think I'm more cool for it. Occasionally they'll say stuff like ""Thanks for hanging out with me, I had a lot of fun"" and it's like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Luckily, I'm good at regulating myself so I'm not overbearing

I'm really shy + awkward traits in real life. I typically feel like dead weight in comparison to my more outgoing friends. There are hints that I'm alright socially. I do still get invited to stuff. I guess my self esteem isn't always there",0

I am scared that right now I am doing some mental gymnastics to convince myself that I am not a lazy, stupid, anti-social fraud.

I don't have that sense of being part of a group because I went to a university or because I studied in a specific field.  

I still don't know if I am gifted because like someone said beautifully in a previous post in this sub, it's kind of being able to reach to your soul without any interference and see the world for what it really is. Maybe I don't explain it very well and my English is a little bit rusty. 

I think that doubt itself is such an important concept to grasp, understand and master , especially if you're gifted.",0
"Frustrated over giftedness/being different So my giftedness comes with a not so great side effect, overexcitabilities.

I do desperately want to be like everyone else.

Overexcitabilities are the heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities.

The overexcitability that bothers me so badly is physical overexcitability.

That means that I need to move around a lot more than other people.

I often get accused of having ADHD and one point I got so frustrated with my physical overexcitability that I got tested. The test came back negative.

I also tested negative for restless leg syndrome.

I have to live around my exercise routine, so that I can sit still at work and sleep in the evenings.

One of my friends was flabbergasted when I told her I had to go for a run at 6:30pm or I wouldn’t be able to sleep.

I feel like my entire life is being controlled by my need to move.

I hate it. 

I feel like every other adult in the world can sit still but me.",0
"I might not actually be gifted Looking back, I honestly don’t know if I am actually gifted. Now that I know I’m autistic, I’ve been looking into it a lot as a way of trying to make things in my past make sense. 

One of the possible symptoms of autism is hyperlexia, and I’m pretty sure they just mistook my hyperlexia for giftedness. 

Hyperlexia is described as “when a child can read at levels far beyond those expected for their age. “Hyper” means better than, while “lexia” means reading or language. A child with hyperlexia might figure out how to decode or sound out words very quickly, but not understand or comprehend most of what they’re reading”

That pretty much explains perfectly why they thought I was gifted. They believed I was gifted because of my quite advanced reading skill, and now that I know hyperlexia is a thing I’m doubting if I was ever actually gifted.",0
"Don't you feel the need to ""censor yourself""? I changed school recently due to bullying and social isolation. The last year I spent there was horrible. An apathetic me walked with a dead face through the corridors. I did not raise my hand, I was no longer interested in anything and my grades fell. And now that I've started again, my parents told me that there was no longer any need to hold back, and that I could be myself among my new peers. Everything went well so far, but I have realized that slowly, I am losing that ""shame"" to be seen as I am. Now they look at me differently, they make jokes about me... They think I'm bragging, and personally, I think that too. My self-steem has increased a lot, now I ask questions, I talk more and I asked the teacher for more material.

Why be more intellectually efficient, to gather knowledge, to have quirks, what's the use ? What do I do with being aware of the world operation, seeing patterns, having an extensive imagination ?

"Just realized I'm autistic, knew I was gifted my whole life - loneliness and sadness Hello all. I've known that I was gifted my whole life. I was very precocious in my curiosity and language. My dad used to be super proud of me because strangers would comment things like how I was destined for great things. While this was an interesting experience, it was also kind of crippling because I grew up thinking that I needed to invent warp drive or something like that. Anything less was a disappointment, so I eventually gave up on everything. 

I took the MENSA test about a decade ago when I started trying to figure myself out. I wanted to know definitely if I was gifted or not and I scored off the chart. So I've known that I was a statistical anomaly for at least the last 10 years. 

But then more recently I've had social difficulties again, pretty severe. I used to think my social difficulties were only because I was gifted. I read the book Gifted Grownups after I took the MENSA test and so I knew that a lot of gifted people are misunderstood/lonely. However, my life has been kinda rough lately and I met someone who told me about masking/camouflaging. As things got worse, I finally took the CAT-Q and it turns out that I'm also pretty significantly autistic, but I've just been masking hardcore.

I'm writing this because it's only just been over a week since I found out about being ASD and I'm still waiting on my appointment to get a formal diagnosis. As I wait, I'm trying to integrate all this information about myself. I'm gifted and autistic. So I'm a double anomaly. Autism is like 1.5% to 2.2% of the population depending on the source you look at. Then my IQ is like the top 0.2% (not trying to brag, I'm just different). So I am a very rare pokemon. Yay. Writing this out, I just feel sad. 

Sure, there are benefits to being gifted and autistic. My brain can do things that most people can't. But it's also very lonely. Fortunately I've found a partner who is very similar to me - similar IQ and also ASD. But if we're both super rare, like 1/20,000 people or so, I dunno. It just feels dangerous because what if we never met? 

I'm about to lose a lot of friends because my mask slipped and I experienced autistic burnout, which is scary to people who don't understand it or are intolerant. The irony is that a lot of people claim they are big into diversity and inclusion, but when push comes to shove, they resort to bullying like everyone else. 

Anyways, I'm rambling now.",0

"I’m curious what this sub’s thoughts and experiences are regarding online courses TLDR*
I have a vague question about online courses: are they worthwhile for gifted learners compared to other learning methods? 
Additionally, I am generally curious about gifted and/or passionate learners experiences with Coursera type online courses.

*I put the TLDR at the start because I probably could’ve only written it rather than several paragraphs. My point being, the TLDR and title get my question across so don’t bother reading the rest unless you’re  curious or fond of sloppy and unorganized writing.

    I just graduated high school and I’m yearning for college to start in august. I’ve grown to have a strong urge to be productive and improve myself. 
    To satisfy this, I have begun a couple online courses. They are interesting, however I’m not sure if the structured format is the best way for me to learn. I only have a couple hours of experience with the online courses, so I am here primarily to ask if these courses tend to actually be helpful regarding education and academic merit. 
    The reason I’m asking here is because as far as I am aware, many gifted people tend to get less reward from constructed learning compared to other options like self education or learning from experience. My doubt surrounding structured courses may just be a misunderstanding I have about education based on high school confining us to low level, less interesting courses. I am hopeful that college classes will feel very different, but in the meantime I’m wondering if for someone like me these courses would be worthwhile.",0
"solo-traveling: new old experiences I had the funny idea of flying to South Korea for vacation (I am German, it is my first big travel outside of Europe and alone). Having a bore-out, I needed something new. I am in Seoul since last week and my interaction problems with other people is just the same as back home. I never understood why I am different, why I feel so different, why I couldn't connect, why people don't understand me and vice versa, etc. Learning about giftedness for 1-2 years that it is not just a number but more of a personality trait, I am now able to watch myself interacting with people on those ""different"" levels and what problems I had because of this all my life: all I wanna do is talking about Dabrowski's theory on positive disintegration, but what I actually do is asking my chinese roommate - staying at a 4-bedroom hostel thingy -  if she wants go grab some food ( 吃饭吗?). Her Englisch is not good and my Chinese bad as hell.
I kinda hoped to feel a change or something different in interaction when traveling to a complete different culture, but the alienation feels all the same.

"Advice on possibly starting child in kindergarten early My daughter is four (she turns five at the end of November). She was tested this week by our school system to see if she can start kindergarten this fall (instead of next year when she would normally start). Based on the results of her testing, she has qualified to start early. Her full scale IQ was scored at 135 and her verbal a 140.

I'd like some advice on reasons to consider for not starting her early. If she didn't start early, she'd be going to a pre-school with other four years old. The pre-school does have an educational curriculum and I'm sure the school would work with us to the extent possible to keep her challenged, but I doubt it would be exactly the same. Physically she's one of the tallest children (if not tallest)  in her current pre-school class, so there likely won't be a significant size gap between her and the other kindergarten children.",0

"not sure what to do I've got a gifted grade skipper. She's 11 and just finished 6th grade. She took pre-algebra this year. The start of the year was rough. Transitioning from cyber school (pandemic) to her first year of middle school, on top of her math teacher taking a leave of absence and having a string of subs from September to February. She did not do well the first two marking periods, bad grades, but the second two marking periods were pretty good. Her math teacher contacted me yesterday and suggested that she be placed in regular 7th grade math class next year instead of 7th grade Algebra. He said if she does well, which he is certain she will, then she can take 8th grade Algebra, which is still a year ahead of schedule. Regular 7th grade math isn't even pre-algebra, so it's a step back from where she was this year. It seems like it would be a very easy course for her. I discussed it with my daughter, and she really wants to take the Algebra class in 7th grade. She said she's willing to take Khan Academy pre-algebra over the summer to catch up and try to fill in any gaps. She said she ""wants to be a math person"" and wants to get ahead in math because she wants to be a scientist. Specifically a chemical engineer. Math teacher said it's ultimately up to us, but that the Algebra class is very intense, with a new topic introduced every day and no repeat info. I don't want to discourage my daughter from trying, I don't want to tell her she can't achieve her goals. I want her to believe in herself and know that we believe in her. I should note that a part of her bad grades was due to her having adhd and frequently losing or forgetting to turn in assignments. This happened in all classes. We adjusted her meds and the issue improved. Any advice? Go with teacher recommendation, or go with what child desires?",0
"My giftedness I wrote a similar post on r/confessions but I’m going to put some more details in here.

So, basically, since I was little (and they still continue) people around me have told me how smart I was, I didn’t believe them.

But some months ago I discovered that I apparently studied way less than other people, and that memorizing pages of something just by reading it once  wasn’t normal.

Then, I finally decided to listen to my mom and read a book called “too smart to be happy” (the book isn’t in English but that would be the title) the book was written by a psychologist that focused on gifted people, the book included a lot of literal quotes from actual gifted patients and I identified with every single one of them, that’s where I realized that what I thought was normal and everyone felt was actually exclusive to me, and that’s were things actually started to make sense.

-I realized people didn’t have this absurd empathy, when I experience something with someone, I feel it from my perspective and theirs, from just a few words I can know what type of person you are to some extent and know how you would react in x situation even if I never saw you going through that, I feel others emotions like they are mine, and know how you are going to react if I say x

-I Always felt like I was strange, but I didn’t know why so I just assumed I was straight weird

-having to hold back with other people (talking slower, not talking about something/more complex topics since they think it’s boring and won’t follow the conversation, not correcting them on things I know they are doing wrong, talking less)

-it’s like everyone has these society’s rules incrusted into them and they follow it so naturally but I don’t understand (I don’t  really know how to put it in words so I don’t know if that makes any sense)

-Having “friends” but feeling alone, and not feeling like a normal person, since you don’t do drugs or alcohol, you don’t start a relationship just because, those kinds of things, and find what supposed to be a “normal conversation” boring and not filling

-Having very intense emotions, like feeling things with a lot more intensity than other people 

-wishing I wasn’t gifted, being gifted has also brought bullying and difficult to socialize

There’s more but the post would be too long

I hope I explained myself well

Ps: I didn’t get all these things from the book, (some did come from it) I got it from my own thinking after I became aware I was gifted

Edit: i didnt assume I was gifted just because of the book, but I wasn’t going to make the post so long just to explain something that wasn’t the point",0

"SCAT Prep/ Hopkins CTY Friends: my son came home from school and said his friend was going to “CTY camp.” After looking into it, I was wondering if anyone had any positive or negative experiences with Hopkins CTY that they could share.

"Conflict and Emotional Intensity I love it when people challenge me. I feel exhilaration when my friends are blunt to me, and there's a good, fiery discussion to be had. The grounds of conflict and confrontation, to some extent, is where I learn. I appreciate friends who challenge me. I appreciate friends who are confident and outspoken

Practically, this means I won't shy away from a strong debate where intense emotions arise. I don't mind being provoked. Obviously, I may experience negative emotions in the moment such as frustration, anger, sadness, or fear. Generally, I enjoy the overall experience because whatever brings about such strong emotions has provided me with a strong incentive stimilus to inspect it. I feel like it turns my brain on, and I can process whatever the topic is rapidly and thoroughly. Admittedly, I rarely come to a fruitful conclusive conclusion during these heated discussions, but they give me food for thought to consider and reflect on afterward. Within a couple hours to a day of reflection in solitude I have processed it properly and drawn what feels like a profound conclusion; something I do not experience in ""bland"" discussion (aka without emotional activation).

Now the issue at hand: mostly everyone I've met HATES this. When I respond so strongly to something they say in discussion, it shuts them down. They experience my intensity as hostile, and / or often walk around on egg shells to avoid both hurting me (they feel guilty about evoking intense emotions in me, even though I've assured them I enjoy it) and being hurt themselves (by experiencing my intense responses).

Let me clarify that at no point in discussion I am abusive, nor do I go for personal attack. What I do is respond quick, blunt, and with emotion. When I notice the argument is getting out of hand (eg me or the other starts acting on emotion rather than content) I make sure to disengage.

TLDR: I perceive heated debate as a playground for me to unleash my intensity, try myself out against others from time to time, and a place where I can grow and learn immensely. My friends, however, perceive it as hurtful, feel like their input is discarded, and live in fear of ""activating"" me.

Any advice on how to accommodate my friends would be very welcome. For their sake, I want them to feel safe and valued in providing me with criticism. For my sake, I would preferably continue to experience what I descrived as heated debates for both pleasure and personal development. 

Some personal info I believe might be relevant in considering the issue at hand:
- I'm gifted and I believe a lot of my close friends are either gifted too, or highly intelligent. 
- I specifically have an exceptionally high processing speed
- I have ADHD mixed type. 
- I identify with the enneagram 8 personality type.",0
"Living after giftedness A little bit of a rant, but need advice. I’m an interesting case where I started in special education as a young kid due to speaking a 2nd language and getting my 2 languages mixed up when speaking to teachers. Also, I was diagnosed with ADHD but my mother was completely adamant that it was a misdiagnosis and my hyperactivity was due to drinking coffee in the morning (my dad spoiled me). Anyways, fast forward, my teachers noticed that by the time I got to the 4th grade, I was getting straight A’s in special ed and extremely bored. They placed me in “ regular” classes and still maintained getting straight A’s and being bored and then was placed in Advanced classes. Advanced/ honors classes challenged me but I never really needed to study to maintain an above average GPA. 

Now as an adult, I feel a little empty. I have amazing ideas for novels but don’t know how to execute. I feel like because I never had to try during my early education, I am left with a handicap. Has any of you gifted individuals felt this way?

"Opinion on which direction I should go with my 6 year old My daughter is six and will be going into first grade next year. We noticed some issues with anxiety and very advanced language. At four we had her tested by a psychologist due to concerns about her not adjusting to preschool and new environments.

They do achievement tests in reading and math. She qualified in reading at the 98th percentile. She did not qualify in math at the 78th percentile. They did not administer a cognitive test and she did no qualify for the GT program. They recommended having her retested next year since she qualified in one area. I suspect she is a bright child but not gifted. She picks up new concepts quickly but still needs to be taught. She does complain about being bored with class work and wants to know when she can do different work from peers. The kinder curriculum has been too easy for her overall. She is doing much better adjusting to kinder and is doing ok socially. My question is should I have her retested next year or just let it go?",0
"Son just tested into Gifted Hey all, I’m new to this sub so feel free to redirect me. My son just tested into gifted. He is six.

Also, he still sometimes reads or does math backwards which is interesting because his spatial reasoning is off the charts. He sees things his own way often. 

We did not tell him exactly what the assessment is for; I mentioned it was a way to know what he knows so we can know what to teach him. My concern is I’m wondering if I’m missing something big (adhd, dyslexia, anxiety) or if he’s just not motivated to do work that seems pointless to him.

"IQ tests' results aren't as meaningful compared to when you take them as a kid, when IQ tests tend to be administered. Obsession with these tests now will only leave you disappointed or haughty. Developing your empathy and improving your confidence, in yourself, is more important. Taking an IQ test as an adult is not a good measurement of giftedness, as it is innate and recognizable and quantifiable at a young age. Gifted children's IQ tend to then increase with age, not decrease, given their innate abilities, especially for those who are 2E. That is why they, if their family or teachers notice, tend to get placed into special or particular programs early on. Including whole institutions for the gifted youth, where they congregate. You won't find them on Google the way you think you will. It's not kept secret. It's just what it is, and we just don't care or regard it as anything special. Others do, especially those who perhaps have low self-esteem and bet everything on their perceived giftedness.

Adults can outsmart things easily. Children, meanwhile, aren't obsessing over anything in such a manner. They know they are different. Everyone has told them; there is no doubt. And yet there is. There is a lot of self-doubt in unique ways that are not immediately recognizable or identifiable by others. It can get lonely and extremely alienating, very easily. A lot of gifted children grew up isolated, mocked and rejected by their peers, due to their idiosyncrasies. Or they were homeschooled/heavily accommodated for. Or they blended in with the crowd. Masking.

"""Type of giftedness"" and career choices Do you believe that people should take mainly into consideration their abilities when it comes to choosing a career path?

Well, first I'll give you context: though I am conventionally gifted in the sense that my IQ is 130+, my score in ""verbal comprehension"" is outstandingly the highest (let's say that I'm mainly verbally gifted). Furthermore, though I'm usually praised for my writing abilities in my native language and people sometimes get surprised at the speed at which I can learn languages without actually studying or living in ""the correct"" environment, I don't ""feel"" that my abilities in math are strong and, honestly, I sometimes feel a little incompetent though I never put a lot of effort in trying to learn math.

In spite of it, I plan on studying economics (""economy"" in my country which is the specific degree in economics that allows one to become an economist and, as far as I know, is the most intense in mathematics), a news that hasn't really been well received by most people -especially [my native language] teachers- and left me feeling like I'm wasting my potential and choosing both a degree that will be very hard for me (not that I would like to study a non-challenging degree, but still) and a career that won't make me happy because of my own incompetence and the effect that that might have over my motivation and, consequently, how much I'll like my job.

Rephrasing the initial question: do you think that I should abandon the idea of studying economics and just pick a more verbal-skills-related degree?

"which camp are you for active or passive nihilism ?  

# Active vs. Passive Nihilism

A great many philosophers have dedicated considerable amounts of their waking moments wrestling with the problem of nihilism; or more specifically, the problem of overcoming nihilism. Nevertheless, nihilism itself remains a mystery — least of all its consequences for mankind. To be sure, an adequate definition of nihilism is wanting. In the most general sense, nihilism refers to the absence of any objective, universal or intrinsic value. From this, it necessarily follows that our metaphysical beliefs, our moral/ethical values, and even our own existence, are completely and utterly lacking any inherent meaning.

As a direct consequence of nihilism, man is forced to see reality for what it is: a random, irrational, and chaotic existence in which our role is infinitesimal. Nihilism, in this capacity, serves to break down all the illusions, myths, and all other social, cultural constructions that have hitherto given us a false sense of security and hope.

In its active form, nihilism is likened to a hammer — used not only to chisel away all artificial meaning, but to smash them. Active nihilism paves the way for the creation of new values, the overcoming of the self by taking a new relation to oneself as an autonomous creator. In effect, this is the transformation of living as the “one-self,” into “my-self.” Thus, the end result of nihilism in its active form is nothing short of paving the way for the grounds to becoming my own self.

Passive nihilism, on the other hand, is epitomized by resignation; the prognosis that life is an “unprofitable episode,” (in Schopenhauer’s words). Nietzsche equated passive nihilism with Schopenhauer’s repudiation of life via the denial of the Will as a great threat. Nihilism in its passive form, while adopting the same prognosis of existence as active nihilism, thus nevertheless takes the opposite stance of active nihilism as to how we should respond to the problem of a meaningless, value-less, and chaotic existence.",0
"which would you say you operate from in regards to Nietzsche master and slave morality ?  

## Master morality

Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. He criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten its origins and that it is based merely on habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He writes that in the prehistoric state ""the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences""[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche197362-1) but that ultimately ""\[t\]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche197396-2) For strong-willed men, the ""good"" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the ""bad"" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty.

The essence of master morality is *nobility*. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trustworthiness, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the ""noble man"", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. ""The noble type of man experiences *itself* as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, ""what is harmful to me is harmful in itself""; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is *value-creating*.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-3) In master morality, people define the good based on whether it benefits them and their pursuit of self-defined personal excellence.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-Solomon-4): loc 1134, loc 1545  Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization) through the [will to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power).

## Slave morality

According to Nietzsche, masters create morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [re-sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment)—devaluing what the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as good.

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is *utility*:[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973122-5) The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche sees this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [will to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power)) are evil, as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [Biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical) principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. ""The *democratic* movement is the heir to [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity)""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973125-6)—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

>...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused ""rich"", ""godless"", ""evil"", ""violent"", ""sensual"" into one, and were the first to coin the word ""world"" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for ""poor"" as a synonym for ""holy"" and ""friend"") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With *them*, there begins the *slave revolt in morals*.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973118-7)

## Society

According to Nietzsche, the struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. He noted that ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [Homeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer) hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the [*Iliad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad) and [*Odyssey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey) exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes ""men of a noble culture"",[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973153-8) giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as Christianity's slave morality spread throughout the Roman Empire.

After the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD Judea completely lost its independence to Rome, and after the defeat of the Bar-Kokhba revolt in 136 AD it ceased to exist as a national state of Jewish people. The struggle between the polytheistic culture of Rome (master, strong) and newly developed Christian monotheism in former Judea and surrounding territories in the Middle East (slave, weak) lasted continuously until 323, when Christianity became the Roman Empire's official religion. Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the ""*collective degeneration of man*"".[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche1973127-9) He claims that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [ressentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment) Nietzsche calls ""priestly vindictiveness"",[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-FOOTNOTENietzsche196719-10) based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong and thus erode the basis for power by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by ""the most intelligent revenge"" of the weak.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality#cite_note-11) Nietzsche saw democracy and Christianity as the same emasculating impulse, which sought to make everyone equal by making everyone a slave.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the ""be-all, end-all"" behavior. He thought that the [revaluation of morals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaluation_of_values) would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality.\[[*cit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)",0

"Burnout theory Hi, all. I have a theory about burnout. 

I think sometimes it happens from living someone else plan for one's life. I think some of us are reduced to what grades and degrees we can produce and get tired of it. Simply put, we want to be treated like full human beings. 

We have feelings and interests which may not always be academic. 

Honestly, I haven't had the best experiences with being gifted. I lived with what some would call oppression. I have people who are inside and outside my family essentially say that I'm nothing without school and that I could not do well at anything else, and also that even if I could do well at something else I shouldn't bother anyway. Everything must be school, school, then work your life away. I've had to deal with my family and their self fulfilling prophecies. After all that, why would I want to be The Smart One?

Imo if someone told a gymnast she could never do well at anything else and forced to spend all her time practicing that would be abusive. Yet people feel perfectly justified in doing something similar to people they perceive as smart.

"Why did my IQ test scores vary so extremely? Which result should I trust more? Hi dear community

So I believed I was not gifted until recently, when I had to do my third IQ test (Raven’s 2) as part of a psychological examination. Interestingly enough, now I suddenly scored 133 points.

So commonly and constantly I hear follow your interests and passions, connect with people of similar interests. But having similar interests has never felt enough on its own.

"How do you learn to balance work and sources of joy? Hello,

I've been struggling for a long time with burnout, and it's been very intense for the past two years or so.

I have classmates that make similar grades as me, but they seem so much less disordered in the way that they gain their achievements. They're still able to have time for themselves, for their friends, and for the things they love...but I don't. I'm constantly taking work home and spending my free time doing schoolwork. Otherwise, I'll fall behind, and when I fall behind, a lot of bad things happen and I start losing the respect of others. 

I'm constantly being pressured by my gifted teacher and others to keep doing more, more, *more*. My gifted teacher guilt trips me for not doing more. I need to do CLEP and/or dual enrollment courses after school, but I don't have time for either of those things. I'm already busy. I already do/have done AP classes, and I'm going to have an AP class and a dual enrollment class in the upcoming school year. I *know* I won't have time to do what she expects of me.

I want to be able to keep up with others in watching shows and movies. I want time to turn everything off and just exist without stress.

I'm 2e (Gifted+ADHD, and possibly ASD too). Once I started the treatment for ADHD when I was seven years old, people didn't stop telling me I was gifted, always getting the best grades in school. I kept gifted even one decade later after I finished the treatment.

Gifted+ADHD/ASD was the perfect recipe for my odd interests that made people expect more from me than I'm nowadays. I learned to read at three years; at seven, my favorite activity was reading biographies of famous scientists. When I was younger, I showed an affinity for computers. I learned PHP and Javascript in the last years of elementary school and Java in junior high school. The people thought I would have been an IT genius.

At the beginning of senior high school, I switched from informatics to chemistry. At the end of high school, I changed to linguistics. Of course, I'm ADHDer, so I never had an interest in a single area.

Finally, college came, and my 2e-brain isn't good enough to manage time properly. In the first year of college, I was interested in social research, but I dropped all my interests because of the lack of time and the boredom. Then the pandemics came, I finished college, and I started to work recently in the administrative area of a factory (I studied International Commerce).

Now, I don't have any special interest to pursue and the job steals all my time and energy necessary to learn new things or do something interesting. I found my job boring. I do the same activity every day.

"Feeling like I wasted potential. (I’m really sorry this is very long )

Hi. So I’m currently 15, and I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt about the way my academic life has gone so far. A bit of detail:

To begin with I guess I could say I was intelligent. My mother was a pretty Smart woman, not insanely gifted or anything but probably above average, she worked as a lawyer but put the family above her career. Now my dad, is something else. He is probably one of, if not the most intelligent person I have ever met. He comes across as just a regular guy but he is just very intelligent, his IQ is probably 145+. I mean there is newspaper clippings of him in Liverpool and how he just absolutely smoked everyone else in terms of academic ability, It’s what people have said stands out about him, it’s why my mum dated him, even police officers have mentioned it. So yeah, genetically I was pretty lucky.


From a young age, 5+, i got a reputation for being academically gifted. Not bragging or anything but I remember periods when I would finish the work so quickly I would help the other kids out, which my teachers loved. Looking back I thought ‘Maybe I just developed quicker’ but at the same time I’ve had people call me intelligent my whole life just through speaking to them, so maybe it was true. Compared to my brother and sister, my parents have told me privately that I was more gifted than the others (I am quite similar to my dad personality wise, so maybe I got his genes ) and that they could tell early on.

Long story short my mum decided to move me to a private school as she wanted me to have more academic ‘support’ if you will. Now the thing about me is that I absolutely despised school as a child. I would never read books, stories, anything, and I had a habit of coasting just based on natural ability. This happened the second I reached the private school. Teachers instantly knew I had potential and I was told that by them at age 9, however I was incredibly lazy and didn’t seem to care enough about school, leading to pretty average results academically.


Once I hit about 11/12 ish, I just felt so average. Maybe it was the lack of hard work, or things going on at home (I suffer with really bad depression and anxiety, and a lot of things went on at home , abuse etc) but I just ‘Lost’ that spark, the ability to be ‘like a sponge’ and soak up information like it was nothing seemed to have dissappeared. I always wondered why. Thing is that, with barely any effort, I seemed to do great in English, and other non-mathmatical subjects but maths was a massive weakness of mine and I wonder if it’s due to ADHD (had basically all of the symptoms my whole life but never had it checked). In terms of IQ, I was still gifted, but not 130+ like I used to be. my head just felt so slow compared to how it was a child (pre 11), I found solving problems difficult when before it was a breeze.


Recently my education has taken a nose dive, at 13 I went to another private  school but got bullied and it put me in a situation of further academic damage. I’ve been doing online school for over a year and it’s incredibly difficult , I’ve barely learnt a thing since 2020 October and I’ve had to revise to claw my way back. My mental health is at an all time low right now so I guess that isn’t helping, but I just feel like I wasted my academic potential. I never took advantage of the  gifts I had, and my insane procrastination and laziness basically meant I learnt off poured ability alone but I was still much slower than my classmates when it came to learning. I just wonder why I lost it at such a young age? I get some of it is out of my control but I really want to reignite that once clear spark of brilliance I had inside. Any advice on how I can get it back? Thanks",0
"Shame & doubt after assessment I don’t know where to start but basically, I (F22) went in for a full neuropsychological assessment (9 to 4pm, got a 30mn break to eat) last week. I went in to diagnose / eliminate 3 main diagnoses, which are ADHD, autism and possibly giftedness. I’m rather sure I have ADHD since like half of my family has it & I’ve been on Adderall for almost 8 years now ; as for giftedness and autism, I wanted to rule it out or confirm these. I also have been diagnosed with chronic depression (I do not think it is drug-resistant depression as the meds last long enough to make enough of an impact, but major depressive episodes have been recurring since I was 11) & GAD. 

The neuropsychologist & the consenting form basically said we’d spend maybe 45-1h at most on the anamnesis and then like 5-6h on the cognitive / IQ test(s) (I think it was the WAIS). 

However, the anamnesis lasted like 2h at the very least (!), and the neuropsychologist made many comments that intrigued me. I’m a neuropsychology/sociology major, so ofc, I kinda know a lot of things on the subjects and as such, he said to me he reformulated a lot of the questions since I knew the DSM-V criteria for some of the disorders ; asked me if I had already had done some tests or researched on them (which I did) ; basically said I seemed to be knowledgeable about what I have or haven’t (like dyslexia), but I was like, lol, you’re the professional, self-diagnoses are only valid to an extent, so this is why I wanna make it official. I felt like I was taken seriously, which has been rare for me with psychologists, but I also don’t know if he just said that to see about my social awareness / self-confidence.

The test portion lasted maybe 4 hours ; however, I saw that he tested me a lot more on attention / short-term memory than any other cognitive functions. I asked him why I didn’t get tested on linguistic / verbal comprehension tasks more than 2 or 3 tasks, and he was like, you basically blew off / aced the tests so I don’t think it’s necessary to assess you on that. 

I’ve been over-analyzing my possible results (which only come in like, 1 month, which is torture to me lmao) ever since and I feel that my IQ test won’t be conclusive/even as I feel some tests were extremely easy and others very hard. I feel like maybe I thought I was gifted but was very wrong to think that, and I can’t stop anticipating my final report. It's brought me intense feelings of guilt, shame & self-doubt which I find hard to deal with.

If anyone has had a similar experience, I’d really appreciate to hear about your thoughts & experiences !!!",0
"Conceptual VS performance For my whole life I've had a lot of experience with people of all different levels of intelligence, from low intelligence to exceptionally bright. One thing I've noticed is that smarter people tend to prefer mental tasks that demand ""performance."" I'm guessing this is where general intelligence differences really present themselves most clearly. Smarter people prefer these things because this is where their advantage is biggest.

By ""performance"" I'm referring to tasks like math. I myself (more in the middle at 130) have usually preferred the more conceptual areas because they doesn't require as much effort or strain me as much, as long as it doesn't get too complicated (which usually means the management of many variables at once, which is performance). Let's put it this way: conceptual is like learning, say, that the speed of light is constant for all observers and why. Anyone can do that, because there isn't any actual ""mental load,"" it's not fundamentally different from learning about the lore of some fictional universe. What makes physics challenging is performance, the details, which would be something like learning about Einstein field equations. This causes mental strain when processing. It's an actual weight to be lifted with intelligence. Smarter people tend to gravitate towards these areas because they're ""stronger,"" it's much easier to them. (Sadly for the rest of us, these areas are also necessary for any significant contributions).

You could probably think about topics like philosophy or anything conceptual forever, but anything performance-related or quantitative will eventually make you tired. That explains why the more brilliant people tend to prefer performance - because g is the capacity to ""crunch numbers,"" that mental strength that allows one to succeed when mental performance is needed. From my observations almost all smart people prefer these areas. That's just my theory, let me know your thoughts.",0
DAE deal with a lot of chronic illness alongside and relates to your giftedness. I have seen a limited anecdotal scan of research that that there is some connection between a hyperactive brain and a hyperactive and therefore ill body such as degeneration and older agent heart conditions Viral and auto immune issues are extremely prominent probably because the micro structure of the brain is actually exceedingly important and so disrupting that as it is It has more side effects than we might initially presume and children never are never more active not neurologically but neurologically are gonna seek more situations that might expose them to such things,0
"Arrogance in thought We all have to view the world in some way. It doesn't matter if we're qualified - it's a human need. Even early societies with very little knowledge of how the world works came up with their own stories to explain it (and often took those stories very seriously). Knowing is a necessity, and when we don't know, we delude ourselves into thinking we do. 

We often use ""reasoning"" as a substitute for knowledge. We think of what must be true when we do not know what's true. We also use it in place of concrete evidence when trying to convince people of things. I'm using it right now. It's a necessary thing sometimes - reasoning prevents stagnation, it allows the progress that we have to thank for us no longer living in caves. The problems are obvious though: it's less stable and more vulnerable to bias. Also, if you want to do it from scratch (meaning creating your own worldview and using that instead of using someone else's to justify something) you need very high intelligence to do it properly.

Here's my problem: I don't like what a lot of other people have come up with. All the popular views suck and seem flawed to me. A lot of very smart people have believed in them. It feels like I have the answers, or at least, like mine are better than most people's.

The problem is that the claim that I know better takes some VERY high intelligence to justify. And I'm not that smart, based on my performance on any sort of objective test (only +2 SD, barely made the cutoff). That means I can't trust my own ability to think. But if I can't reason properly, then that puts me in a very strange situation.

I can simply adopt other people's beliefs. But that's not really possible because they seem to be so clearly flawed to me. Many of them also contradict one another. It's expecting me to somehow see that 2+2 = 5. It can't be done.

Besides, the majority has been wrong before. See those ""early societies"" as an example. The average person today probably wouldn't fit in. You might be arrogantly refusing to believe the smart people who say that the Sun revolves around the Earth, for example. Or maybe a better example: a lot of people once believed that beliefs and virtues of their time period, that may not still be popular today, were objective truth. You can argue that they're not, but how do you know that?

Then there's the issue that this would basically turn me into an NPC implicitly accepting whatever I am told. If I lack the judgement to keep my own ideas, how can I be sure the choice to accept others' ideas is right? How can I even make my own decisions? Even a more neutral approach, where I rely on other people's judgement only for matters I don't know much about, would cause the same problem. Humans need ideas about things. I will never know as much about anything as the person who knows the most about that thing. Where is the point where I know ""enough"" to be able to have my own ideas? There isn't much middle ground here because any point like that would be arbitrary. It seems like I have to assume that I have the ability to think as a starting point for anything. If I can't assume that then nothing else is available to me, not even listening to other people's ideas.

On the other hand, if I stick to my own beliefs, I'm placing trust in someone who's unqualified. I am telling all the people smarter than me that no, they're all wrong. It's arrogance and foolishness. It allows me to be an individual, but it also makes me a crazy person type of individual, not any sort of rebel or free thinker. That's basically the difference between a crazy person and a proper free thinker: the free thinker is smart enough to be right.

Neither option works. It seems like my mistake was not being born smarter than everybody else. I'm essentially asking what to do when you can't trust your own mind. Either I give up my ability to be an individual or I'm arrogant. Either I'm not an individual or the stupid type of individual. It's like I have to assume I can think, even if I can't, because everything follows from the ability to think. Everything has to pass through my mind so in order to access anything I basically have to assume I can reason properly even if I can't. Any guidance is welcome.",0

"Large changes in IQ scores from childhood to adulthood ​Long personal story about IQ scores changing considerably, TLDR at the end.

Recently, I (20f) decided to get tested for ADHD. As part of my ADHD assessment, I had to take a cognitive test, specifically the WAIS-IV. 

At age 8, I was identified as gifted through the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test (CCAT), and although I was not present during the debrief between my parents and the school principal, my dad later told me that I had scored in the high 99th percentile, and how the school principle and other teachers had never seen a score that high in their careers. The IQ scored on that test was 142.

That score got me admission into the district's gifted program, which required a minimum IQ of 130. In the program, the teacher called us her ""special cherubs,"" and that, along with meeting other extremely intelligent and motivated folks reinforced me tying my self-worth to my intelligence, particularly in how my intelligence was viewed by others. I remember saying that I ""want to always be the smartest in the room,"" and having my peers look up to me (or resent me) made me happy. My ego was definitely unchecked.

Fast forward to age 10, we had to take a few more (paper) cognitive tests to stay in the gifted program through middle school. This time though, I was so anxious when writing the test, that I blacked out afterwards. When the results came back, my father went to speak with the school principal (a different school, and a different person) to find out my test results. I remember he was so angry, that my class could hear him yelling at the principal from our classroom, and later my dad gave me the silent treatment for what felt like forever. The issue? My IQ score was 131. He said that it ""couldn't be possible,"" and yelled at for not working hard enough. Of course, all of that did no good for my self-esteem, and further perpetuated the notion that my worth was directly proportional to my test scores.

Due to a lack of funding, the gifted program got cut the next year, and in order for me to accelerate through math curriculums, my middle school had me take the WIAT-III, a more hands-on cognitive test assessing reading, writing, and math skills. My reading comprehension scores were in the above average range, but my math scores were   considerably higher. I've sadly lost the math page of the report, but my overall IQ score was 130. 

We had always known that I was more of a math person, so that wasn't surprising at all. With my math score, I was allowed to take math at one grade level higher than mine, and actually sit in an 8th grade math class when I was in 7th grade. I was very impressed by myself, and my entire school knew me as the math whiz. In 7th grade, I wrote the 8th grade-level math competition, and won the provincial 1st place medal.

Then at age 13 I went through some serious psychological trauma that destroyed my mental health.

In my 8th grade year, I didn't win any competitions, but I was still a year ahead in math, self-directing myself through high-school (9th grade) math, and did recently on the standardized final exam.

In my first year of highschool, I accelerated through my math courses taking both grade 10 and 11 math in school. That year, I was recommended to write a different provincial math competition specifically for highschool students aged 17 and under. I crushed the first round, with a near perfect score, and was invited into the second round limited to students with the top 50 scores from the first round. I did terribly on this one because the format was new to me, and it was just a couple months after my stay in a psych ward.

Somehow, my scores from the competition caught the eye of the Canadian Mathematical Society, and I was invited to a math summer camp for the top-30 students in the province under the age of 16.

Of the top 30, I was definitely the 30th. I felt so stupid compared to all the other kids, and did terribly on all of our practice math olympiads.

After this experience, I was crushed. I stopped working hard and more importantly, I stopped trying to learn.

I still did okay in school, and graduated from the IB diploma programme, but I did zero homework, procrastinated constantly, and felt no joy from learning.

In my first year of university, I was a math major. A logical choice right? I used to love math, was somewhat good at it, and  I could finally fulfill my dream of learning real analysis.

I failed every single math course in that year. Calc I, I failed twice, even though it was essentially just a review from highschool, a class I had gotten over 90% in. It almost felt like my brain forgot how to work.

From the age of 14 and onwards, I was in various treatments for my mental health, and I know (logically) that it has changed the way my brain is 'wired'.

Now back to the ADHD.

In my feedback session last week, I learned of my diagnoses, but also the results of my cognitive test. Here are a few of my scores that I remember the oral session (I'll be getting my written report in a few days):

Working memory: 92th percentile

Processing speed: 37th percentile

Overall: 92th percentile (IQ of 122)

I don't know how to feel. IQ is something that doesn't change very much from childhood to adulthood, but IQ scores of 142, 131 and 122 are extremely different from one another. Obviously the testing in childhood was not as rigorous, it was just a pencil-and-paper test, whereas my most recent test was mostly oral, with some physical manipulation. 

I can't help but feel that I've become stupid now, and that I'm just a fraud. I can't even say that I'm gifted anymore (not that I go around in life telling people my IQ, fortunately my social skills are better than that).

TLDR: I'm wondering what this community thinks: Does a more recent evaluation render previous IQ scores obsolete, or are all the scores still valid in a sense? Has anyone else experienced such drastic changes in their IQ scores?",0

"I need help sorting my thoughts. Do I even have the right to complain about my IQ or is it just the under-representation of the darker side of intellectual giftedness, that makes me think I have no right to complain? I have been struggling lately. So, apparently I am ""gifted"" (IQ over 130), but I never feel like it. I was tested last August and I don't know how to handle the result. I always searched for an answer to my struggles academically and socially and thought it would solve all my problems if I had an answer, but it does not. Instead it has all gotten worse. Now, everytime I fail, I tell myself I shouldn't have for I have all the abilities to succeed. Only one of my teachers knows about the fact that I am gifted and now I have failed my 15page-paper in her class (6/15 points) and feel as she might think I lied about my IQ or sth. When I think rationally, I sound insane saying/believing that, yet what if it's true. I feel as if everyone who knows about it expects me to achieve greatness in everything I do, my parents tell me it doesn't matter to them they just want me to be happy, but again, what if they lie so I don't feel as pressured. I try to live up to that expectation of an over-achiever bc I still believe that is what I should be, but instead I just end up with anxiety and struggles concentrating. It does not matter how good my grades are, I still feel like, excuse my language here, shit. Has anyone experienced sth like that? My brain always spins around, thoughts crashing down, I am struggling to concentrate. - So, I am sorry if my problem isn't that accesable from my description, any thoughts are welcome though.

Also, are there more peopel who can only find peace at night, with headphones on and creating an own world? I do this, as far as I can remember visually, since seventh grade, it is the only moment I have full controll over anything that happens and the only time I feel not like an alien to the world, for the world I am in at night is my own.",0

"gifted people are often as closed minded as neurotypicals and i find it hard to relate to them I've thought that maybe it's a magnitudional thing; maybe the more gifted you are the more strongly you embody openness, eccentricity, and sensitivity, but i don't really score higher than 145 which is only 15 points above the cutoff for giftedness. plus, IQ seems very dodgy.

People I've found in this community feel just as cold and empty as others. I don't specifically say this to insult anyone, I can only view this from my perspective, but it's overwhelmingly the way i feel.

I would like to hear from the perspective of others. Gifted people i've met tend to dislike me but they only rarely say why. Usually, people ignore me or i feel a passive-aggressive vibe, but on rare occasions of honesty they say i act ""insane"", the things i say sound ""cursed"", or that i ""schizopost"", (it's actually so funny to say those things in a serious post ksgkdhj)

To me, what i say and who i am sounds completely normal, often just a bit eccentric or theatric, but i feel like my core personhood is being gaslighted and pathologised. People have said they understand but they mostly don't.

i really want to form healthy relationships and be myself but i've only managed to really love and build healthy relationships with a few people. most people i've connected with have been either fictional, dead, or people in my dreams, although i have connected to 2 real people.

I just want to drink tea in a forest somewhere with someone i truly love. In my mind, what i look for in the world doesn't seem too logically absurd, but being perceived that way constantly feels like it's making me insane.",0
"Possibly Gifted? Recently my 3.5 year old took a kindergarten readiness test through our school district. We wanted validation of where she’s at since she will be transitioning to preschool in the fall)and we didn't want her stuck some where learning things that she already knew.

She scored in the 97th percentile and has conceptual age of 5. Obviously, we're not sure if she's truly gifted or advanced.

She speaks like an adult and has an answer for absolutely everything. Her verbal communication is off the charts. She's constantly mistaken,for being older than she is.I swear she could start reading any time she wanted to. Her ability to draw connections with different concepts blows my mind.  Her memory has always been extraordinary.  She's also funny, (very) intense at times, competitive, and drawn to people of all ages. As a baby, she hit all of her milestones early. Just after she turned 2, she was speaking in long, complex grammatically correct sentences.

Our pediatrician (who is also a close family friend and had her own experiences with gifted family members) told me a long time ago that if our kiddo  continued going at the pace she was developing, we might want to watch out for giftedness.  


We chose a play based nature school for her next steps. Right now, I just try to follow her lead with interests and see where that takes us. I'm not too worried about academics right now. She'll have plenty of time for that. 

How likely is it that we can expect her to stay on this same trajectory?

So I've come to the resolution that everytime there is a bad moment in my life I know that time is nothing, that this moment will pass through like nothing because one day I'll be old and feel that life went by, and actually it works, i feel that those bad moments go by fast, which is getting scary, because even when I have good moments I feel they will go fast and they do, suddenly I feel everything is going so quick and in no time I'll actually be the old man feeling that his life went by in a slap of fingers.

"Is the grass greener elsewhere? Do you think some countries are more high IQ/gifted people friendly than others?

Culturally speaking?

As an example, the country I live in, gifted kids weren't recognized 15 / 20 years ago and were suffering a lot at school. The only thing that was offered to them was to advance classes. They weren't provided with more knowledge / stimulation beside this and were forced to follow the average curriculum, resulting in immense boredom and depressed states.

Even nowadays, I would say things didn't change much beside more awareness in schools on how to potentially recognize a gifted child. I would say that there is quite a gap here regarding giftness / high IQ awareness...

Also, intelligence isn't valued. The culture is pretty much pushing everyone to be at the same level (level predetermined by some obscure subjective governmental and cultural factors...).

Gifted kids seem to be able to fulfil theirs needs happily only in wealthy families as they can provide lot of stimulation (high quality private schools, activities, traveling...) that are usually too expensive here for low and middle incomes households.  


But I guess it is pretty common in all countries? 

Regarding gifted adults, well... Most if not all the ones I know left the country as the result of the reasons above, mainly to USA, Canada and Australia where they find much more opportunities to bloom and are much happier.

I am curious if any of you experience any similar observations / interpretations?",0
"Giftedness and work Hi everyone,

I saw that people talk very little here about one of the most important aspects of life - the workplace - so it will be interesting to open a new post about it.
Various surveys show us that gifted people tend to be very successful in professional life - their salary is usually way above the national average and they tend to fulfill career goals. Nevertheless, it seems that besides the successful majority, there is also a notable minority of gifted underachievers - people who don't like their work, struggle financially, occasionally unemployed, or just working in a place that is way behind their potential abilities.
So in your opinion, what are the main causes for some gifted people underachieving? Which obstacles to promotion tend to happen? And which working environments or professions can be really friendly for gifted people (besides the obvious places like universities)? Do you think that in your culture gifted underachieving is rare or makes a significant minority?
It will be great also to hear your personal stories.",0
"Giftedness and knowledge My experience is that I need relatively few facts or data points and very little time to have a basic understanding of things, where I can produce “guesstimates” that seemingly have value for others. And I am able to communicate them in a way that people seem to believe what I am saying. 

This is troubling for me, in the sense that I know I know next to nothing about the topic, there is no depth, yet people are convinced and satisfied. I feel like I’m bluffing my way through life without real knowledge. I do read a lot but there is no topic that I really know every aspect of in depth. 

Are all people conscious that we are walking around bullshitting each other constantly in this way on some level? 

I feel like I need a long time to learn something in depth, to truly understand it. However the time requirement is the opposite of productivity so I have to create output when my inputting has barely started because of the expectation of productivity.

I started a job in a new field once (one that I did not train for or get an education in, but wanted to get into) and about a month in I got the feedback that they had expected to see a greater contribution from me by then, but I was still taking in and processing the company, the culture, the field, my role, office dynamics etc then. I was a bit disappointed in myself but then it only took me a week more for things to “click into place”. Started as a temp for an entry level position and was promoted to manager within a year. I was able to make very quick assessments and decisions at this point, but still felt like I was seriously lacking in true knowledge. 

How come I can get a career out of basic googling skills/ reading a couple of Wikipedia articles? I knew nothing about anything but everyone was satisfied and colleagues gave me the feedback that I was inspiring to work with. 

Knowing how often I change my mind and perspective of something as I gain more knowledge, the idea of anyone listening to my opinion and making decisions based on it frankly scares me. 

I don’t think this is related to impostor syndrome in the sense that I don’t believe everybody else has that much more knowledge than me. It just feels like we’re all bullshitting each other. Emperor’s new clothes or something like that, where we are all the emperor.",0

"Gifted but with average test scores? My kindergarten son is FAR ahead of the rest of his class on reading and math- he’s reading chapter books and doing 3 digit addition/subtraction and negative numbers. He was tested at age 2.5 as part of an evaluation for early intervention and at that point he tested as super ahead in several areas (like scoring as high as a 6 or 7 year old) and the teachers were the first ones to label him as “gifted”. But at his kindergarten testing his scores were in the 70th and 80th percentiles - I have heard a lot criticism of this specific test they do at his school, but I’m not sure what the criticisms are. But this was a lot lower than we were expecting based on his previous testing and what we are seeing as far as his abilities. 

He doesn’t have any learning disabilities that we know of- there is a chance he could have ADHD (my husband and I do, so he’s got the genetic tendencies) but honestly he seems to really excel at the hyper focus part and rarely struggles to concentrate.  

But I’m not sure how to advocate for him if his tests scores are more average.  I was the opposite of him and got test scores in the 98th/99th percentile most of the time but struggled with concentrating and keeping up in school. He is starting to get more bored in school being so far ahead- for a while the new environment and social aspect kept him entertained enough but now that’s wearing off and we’re starting to see some (very minor) behavioral issues that I want to get ahead of. I want to start out with a good plan next school year to keep him engaged in school but I’m worried the teachers won’t see any need if his scores on paper don’t support it. 

Does anyone have any experience with average test scores not related to a learning disability? Or how to advocate for your kids educational needs in the absence of very high scores?",0
"Tendency for complicated relationships Has anyone else noticed a pattern of significant relationships with very different people - racially, socioeconomically, culturally, or maybe with trauma or mental health disorders?

I’m realizing this might be a pattern for me as I’m drawn to the stimulation of “figuring out” a new type of person. Of course, stimulation via novelty is not necessarily a good reason for a relationship. So maybe it’s not the best pattern.",0
"How is ADHD and giftedness differentiated when doing assesments? I'm asking this because my circumstances are: I went to the psychiatrist to be assessed for ADHD as I present a lot of symptoms, she sent me to a neuropsychologist because she feels as though my intellect may be what's causing all of these issues and maybe not entirely ADHD. So now I'm left wondering ""if I show so many symptoms, then how do doctors even differentiate these two?"", and also to make sure nobody misunderstands me, this is not me asking for a diagnosis from people on the internet, this is a genuine curiosity of mine.",0

"Giftedness and Emotional Dysregulation Hi. I’m back again. I have another dumb question. Do any other gifted people have problems with emotional dysregulation?

"To Acceptable_Swimming4, just wanted to let you know that I’m still here to talk if you make a new account To everyone else, I’ll get on my soapbox and say: The answer to your problems is within! I know it’s hard to trust yourself (and I wish more people here would encourage you to) but the way we feel is ALWAYS based in reality. If you’re struggling - it’s real! If you feel like you’ve got no purpose and there’s nothing you alone could ever do to fix it, unfortunately that’s real too. It takes a community of humans to help each other with that, and wholly human communities are difficult to find these days. I guess that means this - if you feel purposeless and community-less, I’d invite you to try to create/find a safe space in your community to talk about those things. Without community, the corporations will have a monopoly on the narratives of what it means to be human. There are good people out there, and hopefully we can start supporting each other in reality!",0
"autistic or gifted? I wasn't sure what else to title this. My 2 year old (closer to 2 than 3), is suspected to have autism. We have his assessment soon, but he's already in early intervention  OT. He does not like to socialize with other kids, has melt downs, rarely makes eye contact, echolalia and third person speech etc. Autism runs in my family so I wasn't really surprised by his behaviors. I'm starting to wonder if maybe he's lacking in those areas because he's skilled in others though. Also, maybe I'm crazy, in which case please tell me.

He can count to 20, he's known his abc's and can recognize each letter since before he was 2. He knows all of his shapes. He memorizes the words to songs almost instantly and then will sing them all day with impressive pitch. The only thing he ever wants to play with is puzzles. His attention span is weird as he can sit in his room and ""read"" his books for hours. Hes also very attentive to his surrounding and will ofteb point things out to me or make connections that I would have never noticed. (Ex. He found three hair ties, arranged them and said ""look, it's mickey mouse"", he saw an orange camero with a black stripe in a parking lot and proclaimed it the ""Nemo car""). I  thought all of this was normal because i don't have any friends with kids. But recently my sister who is a nanny came to visit and she was shocked to say the least. now it really has me wondering.

"Anyone else feel like they consume information slowly? I thought this was just a weird quirk of mine, until recently, I spoke to someone with very similar experiences. Both of us felt the need the need to pace around after consuming only small amounts of knowledge, like a few paragraphs/pages in a book, and if we didn't do so we'd get frustrated, irritated, confused, and wouldn't fully comprehend or remember whatever knowledge we'd consumed. Additionally, more specifically, we'd both envision ourselves explaining things we were trying to understand to people. All of this made us very inefficient learners, although we had no issue applying or manipulating abstract knowledge we'd already learned. Also, we were both coincidentally interested in very similar fields, being literature, and the more sublime side of psychology.

"female role models for gifted girls Hi I (33f) was tested as gifted at school and it was never explained to me. I've always been good at writing and ended up in linguistics/language development. Like a lot of people gifted in fields other than math/science, I rarely get acknowledged that I am gifted. In fact my husband, who is an engineer and regularly called a genius, is the only one to treat me like I'm just as smart as him.

Which brings me to my post. My daughter (2) is showing signs of giftedness and I keep wanting to push her into maths/problem solving because of my own history/hang ups and because all the examples of intelligence seem to be men in STEM (Einstein, big bang characters, etc). 

I could really do with a role model for her of a woman, especially someone who is outside of the Stem fields, who is called a genius or acknowledged to be above average intelligence.

Any suggestions I could learn about and share with her as she grows up?",0
"Kendrick Lamar exudes giftedness I have had a suspicion for the longest time that Kendrick is definitely a gifted person, and he released a song on his newest album where he talks about seeing his giftedness as a young child. To some, this is probably obvious, but I wanted to post this to talk about the way he embodies it. 

I think Kendrick has an amazing grasp on what it means to be gifted, and what it means to live a fulfilling life as a gifted person. He describes an intense struggle on Good Kid Maad City of feeling isolated and different from his peers as well as the pressure to live a certain lifestyle. I think he begins to display his gift and use it extraordinarily well on To Pimp a Butterfly with his insane lyricism and loud, jazzy production which is symbolic of his newfound confidence in his gift. He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone anymore, at this point, Kendrick is one of the greatest alive at what he does and he knows it. This album is so influential, in fact, that many begin to praise it as the greatest hiphop album of all time. I think DAMN starts to reflect on the emotional struggles and intensity of being gifted although other themes are definitely present like all of his other albums.

This is what I love about Kendrick and his development as an artist. He's always seeking to go further and to reflect with more honesty. He shows a constant desire to adapt and improve and this is a huge part of giftedness in my opinion. Not to mention the undeniably deep connection that his thoughts and feelings share. 

On his most recent album, he takes the depth of his music further by describing the struggle of being seen as a prophet or some person to worship, and I think this is very reminiscent of giftedness and living up to the expectation of always being the best.  I think Kendrick's discography perfectly describes the journey of a gifted individual in an environment where giftedness is not widely accepted or nurtured (you could even make parallels here to tupac's Tu Pimp a Caterpillar and Kendrick growing and becoming the butterfly, hence to pimp a butterfly).",0
"To be or not to be that is the question. Hi all, I'm not sure why I'm writing this, since probably nobody is going to read it, but I had the impulse to write something about this topic and share my opinion with any other human being who's willing to read and comment on it. I hope there is no character limit on the post because I'm going to absolutely smash the fuck out the character count. I could have written this in any other subreddit (like r/psychology) but I felt this was the appropiate one. And please do not hesitate to reply if you have lived something similar or feel somehow related to me.

I'm now 26 years old and I probably do qualify as ""gifted"" for today's standards, even though I've never done an IQ test and never will, because I think they are complete bs. You all are intelligent enough (pun intended) to guess that no test can judge the intelligence of a person based on weird random logical patterns. But since I was a kid I knew there was something a bit different in me. It is some sort of cosmic radiation that most people have in a really small percentage that yet I seem to have in a higher concentration. How easy it was for me to think abstract concepts and connect ideas it was not average, even though I though that at the beginning everybody could do so. I'm also one of those weird XNTP (on the logical side of the Meyers briggs) (even though I think Mayer bricks is bs too) As you can guess I have a really weird relationship with psychology. Yeah, since I was a kid I've been to many psychologists because my parents couldn't really understand me and I had an extreme vivid imagination that was always crafting stories about evil witches, blood thirsty monsters and anything extreme that implied some kind of heroic act. To be honest when I was 4 years old my dream was to climb mount Everest and lose a hand on the way up. A bit weird if you ask most people. I also had trouble falling asleep and imagined there were always monsters lurking below my bed, especilly velociraptors, those fuckers had me completely frightened at night.

In the beggining I used to be a happy kid playing football (real football, not the melon shaped ball that americans play) and I was pretty good at it but I would sometimes be hit by abstract concepts and wonder about the essence of the universe and the existence of free will... while I was in the middle of a football game. Later I discovered that the other kids weren't really into metaphysical paradoxes but rather about capturing Pikachus (Hey I was into that too).  I've always felt sometimes like an alien that comes from another planet and tries to blend with people. I've always been downgrading my vocabulary (in my native language) just to fit in and I've never felt that I belonged in any group. I do have friends that come from all sorts of places all of them with different ways of living and political opinions but I don't belong to any of them. One day I can go and see my friend that works in a consulting firm in a 9 to 5 job and talk about the current economy and the minimum wage and have great fun and another day I can go and smoke a joint with my friend that is triying to survive selling stuff on the streets.

In today's society we tend to idealize intelligence as the far superior trait any other person could have.  But please, let me explain the reasons why we might be falling short here.

I've met 2 really intelligent persons in my life with an IQ above 160 (maybe I've met others but I didn't know) One of them is working in a public school earning minimum wage, and the other one killed herself. I don't think people really realize the consequences that implies being gifted.

For those who have seen the movie ""interview with the vampire"" probably remember what the journalists tells the vampire at the end of the movie. The vampire ""Tom Cruise"" after explaining the sheer amount of pain and suffering he has had to endure for the last 400 years living off rats because he could not tolerate the death of another human. And yer the first thing the journalist who is interviewing him asks is: ""please, can you bite me and turn me into you""? 

Nowadays most kids qualify in school and are denominated as a child with: ""high capabilities"". Now everybody seems to have high capacities. I think there is a big difference between being intelligent and beeing gifted. Being gifted ""really gifted"" is a curse, not a gift. Being gifted is racing with a rocket in a horse race. Being gifted is feeling like an outsider and an alien for most part of your life. Being gifted is perfectly understanding the rules of the game and yet being unable to participate in the game. Life is an illusion folks, and like any other show that you attend you have to make a suspension of your disbelief. Regular people can do that. Lately I can't. Living is believing that love exists and not thinking that is just another engine of nature to replace yourself (BTW i believe love exists). Living is believing that we live in the best of the possible worlds and not really thinking about how we are just another pawn controlled by the system. We are pawns, but yet some are more self conscious that others that we are pawns.

We are bound and doomed to happiness not to intelligence. 

But there is something far greater than intelligence, something that soothes your troubled mind and inspires awe. And that is wisdom. Intelligent people are not wise. Wise people know that reasons are reasons but at the end a house built in the middle of the desert is not worth living. We are bound to where the river flows and where the fresh flowers grows. I've seen both. And I can tell you that intelligence is one of the most overrated concepts our society has been investing in. 

If you have a higher percentage of the pie, you also have more chances to get a rotten piece. And by rotten piece I mean some sort of mental disorder. If you think you are gifted and you have never stumbled across any of the common disorders like ""anxiety"", ""depression"", ""ocd"" etc, you probably aren't gifted and you should be so happy. Now, as I have told before I do not consider myself as gifted I'm just above average probably and a weird human being that get's bored easily with everything he does. 

What do you guys think? Are we really rasing a false god called intelligence? Or we should really keep believing in all this ""progress"" thing and we should continue to pay our bills to the ""intelligent idols"" like Elon Musk and be ready to pack our stuff to go to Mars? For me being gifted is understanding your own limits and being able to really live your life to the fullest remembering that at the end we are only a bunch of monkeys that are playing to be God.",0
"Lack of empathy for First World problems? This could have something to do with the supposed 'hypersensitivity' gifted people have. We're meant to be more sensible to the world that surrounds us, as well as informed on the whole about general affairs. Here's a lead-in question: do any of you feel like you know so much about the world than the average person, and therefore fail to empathise with first-world problems?

In my case, I live in a first-world country where only a minimal percentage of the population suffers from homelessness/extreme poverty. Nevertheless, there's a huge amount of others living in poorer countries where there's not even basic infrastructure for them to have clean water, let alone electricity, with only dirt roads between town and town, whose lives are incomparable to those of us lucky enough to have internet access.

It just baffles me that everyone here takes everything for granted, all of the time. Psychologists have come up with labels for mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and every year there's more and more diagnoses. Many can't even stomach the thought of spending more than ten minutes without their phone readily available. Some complain because ""the Wi-Fi doesn't work"" or ""Instagram is down for maintenance"". In the field of academics, there's the typical guy who cries because his mental health depends on a grade from A+ to F, and won't accept anything less than a B. Additionally, (I don't want to get political but so be it), the ""I am offended"" tropes from both sides of the debate have gotten into the most intense fighting in decades and negatively affect every country they're in. This entitledness is so deeply ingrained, (I think) mainly due to ignorance, that the new Generation, also dubbed the Crystal Generation, is widely considered to be the weakest in history.

So whenever I am told about how 'bad' or 'horrible' a situation is, or hear someone acting like any of the abovementioned, I genuinely can't feign I see it as a real problem. My natural reaction (in my mind) is: ""Well, it could be a lot worse. You're better off than 80% of humanity, just because you were born here.  Why don't you instead stop crying and be grateful for everything you actually have?""

Anybody relate or have a differing perspective to offer? May giftedness play a part in this way of thinking?

TL;DR: Those of us in the West are better off than 80% than humanity just because we were born here, yet we have the most mental health issues, suicides and 'first world problems', while people in underdeveloped countries may not even have the most basic infrastructure like clean water, but are more mentally stable. I posit that our people are too entitled and therefore I, personally, can't understand 'first world problems', knowing the aforementioned.",0

"What exactly is giftedness (from a scientific pov)? What is giftedness? Is it the same as high intelligence? (I'm not associating high intelligence with IQ because IQ is usually measured by IQ tests and they are very misleading imo. I'm talking about high intelligence from a more subjective view- including artistic and creative intelligence)

Is it having a high intelligence but also displaying certain traits than not everyone with a high IQ would? If yes, then does everyone who is ""gifted"" have high intelligence? Are there people with high intelligence who are not gifted? Given that we don't even have a solid reliable way of measuring intelligence, what can we even say for sure?

Scientifically speaking, what qualifies as giftedness?

I know that giftedness is more encompassing than intelligent because it also includes other areas like music, dance, etc. that intelligence, in the more typical sense doesn't. But other than that, what is the difference between the two?

Note: I am not trying to say that giftedness doesn't exist or anything. I'm sorry if it comes across as that. I, a supposedly gifted person myself, only recently discovered the term gifted and what it entails. And I have so many questions. All of this is out of pure curiosity.",0

Also on the link between high intelligence and performance in different facets of intelligence?- for eg) how is reasoning linked with high intelligence as opposed to critical thinking, etc. Just something that explores the different aspects of intelligence and how they are correlated.

Also the science of intelligence in general, like what parts of the brain tell us what about intelligence?

"Accounting for Practice Effect I only took one real IQ test, in my early childhood, and barely made it past 2 SD to get into the gifted program. But I'm realizing that my score is practically invalid. They say you can't retake the WAIS within six months because of practice effect, but I had done practice questions for two weeks leading up to my IQ test, so I'm terrified that my IQ is actually much lower. Now idk how to figure out if I was really +2 SD or if I was one of those dummies who weaseled their way in despite not really belonging there. When I was being assessed the question formats were very familiar, maybe I wouldn't have made it in if I didn't have that unfair advantage. I was given practice to get in and then they bought their own lie when I did, but why did they give me the practice if I was really gifted? Why did I barely make it in even with the advantage of practice?

I know many of you like to crap on intelligence and giftedness. But it's very important to me that I'm smart. So please just humor me. Maybe it doesn't matter to you but to me the idea that I'm not smart is very scary. I'm not good at anything else, and even the best-case scenario of 130 IQ isn't that high, so if I'm even lower than that then idk what to do. I need to be smart, I'm not content with being incapable and you can't convince me to be. Please just humor me.

I don't think I can do another real test because I've been doing too many online ones for the result to be valid. But I need to know my IQ. What studies are there on practice effect and the ability of practice tests to get non-gifted children into gifted programs?

"Does anyone's learning have a rhythm? I don't know what else to call it but for me it seems I sometimes get into something and you could call it a flow state but there is also a momentum too. Maybe that's the natural building up of knowledge over time but sometimes it can happen very quickly. It has to do with sustained attention I think.

I went to a school with a lot of gifted kids and there was this energy sometimes for some of them. Like I guess you could call it an excitability. Like the importance of what was being learned was growing with the understanding. I couldn't understand exactly what was driving that importance.

So do any of you actively find a rhythm or groove to get into where learning can compound faster.

For me right now it seems it's about getting as deep into the nuts and bolts of things as possible, as well as many other things. I feel like there are a lot of pathways to use here.",0
"I can control my dreams Hey everyone.



Ever since I was a kid I dreamt VIVID dreams. I would see snakes and insects around my bed right when I woke up. It wasn’t until I got baptized a couple years ago when I started lucid dreaming. I can control my dreams almost every night. I am aware I’m dreaming, and I can change buildings, fly, and make things appear (such as animals, water, books). I usually dream of spirits and possessions. Almost every dream has a possessed person, and I’m praying over them. I sometimes see my physical body when I’m dreaming, and I feel like I’m shifting from different realities. I know that sounds crazy. I just had a lucid dream last night, these two children were sitting on the couch and I looked at them. I said “I know this is a dream and I’m dreaming.” They looked at me as if I wasn’t supposed to say that. It was a bit freaky. Also, whenever I wake up there’s a few seconds of me seeing spiders and insects around me.
It’s not only dreams, but whenever I randomly think of someone, a few days later I find out something happened to them. This has happened quite a few times. For example, I thought of a person, and then couple days later I find out they’re pregnant or they passed away. I sometimes think of people I haven’t talked to for years, and that happens. I don’t know what any of this means. Maybe it’s a coincidence idk.

"Trying to figure out just how smart I am and I feel so lost **Introduction**

1) **I am 15 and have been considered a ""good"" or ""smart"" student all along (but nothing toooo crazy- very smart at best). Before I go on, it's important to take note of the fact that I have ADHD (and depression) and I basically have spent my entire life (not exaggerating) procrastinating and have never really shown any signs of** ***exceptional*** **intelligence like reading books way higher for my level or delving into fascinating unknown topics instead of studying.**

 Yeah, no, none of that. Guess what I did for almost 15 years straight? Kept browsing and scrolling through random bs on yt, reddit, etc. And I'm not talking things that ignite a curiosity in me- just random bs that I didn't even really want to read or watch over half of the time. Now that I think, it was more of a way of passing time because I reallyyyy didn't want to study (can't even pinpoint a reason because it has been this way ever since i can remember and idr why because i was way too young and then it just became a habit- although I do know that a couple months ago, the first time ever, I was trying to study not just a couple hour before exams, I found just the thought of it very overwhelming. But before that I didn't even try studying, so I wasn't really overwhelmed by them as such? idk if you get what i mean?)

2) **So I basically managed school by cramming a couple hours before the exam because when I am that stressed my adhd seems to magically vanish and managed 95+ up till 7th grade and around 90 sometimes less, after.**

My teachers and peers seem to think I'm intelligent because I participate a lot- mostly just ask questions and for some subjects that I kind of like- take a lot of notes. A lot of my peers and teachers think I slog for hours at an end everyday because of the first impression they formed of me in the beginning from initial classes and that almost makes the whole thing worse.

**Argument - For**

1) So the main reason I ever even started considering the possibility of being gifted was because of my **ability to analyse complex nuanced situations** in **great depth** and **high emotional intelligence** (namely because of my ability to analyse my own actions in the same depth as I do with other situations, introspection, questioning my bias, etc.)

2) I also LOVEEE analysing interesting nuanced topics and especially love discussing such things with people who can also do the same. I legit live for those **conversations**. I do tend to gravitate more towards **sociology, psychology and philosophy** than more technical topics.

3) Kind of similar but I want to group all similar points together, so excuse me if this seems too dragged out. Either way, **I think too much and it comes fairly naturally to me and I do it for every tiny little thing subconsciously**, could just be my overthinking nature rather than iq tho.

4) **I am pretty curious about everything and anything**. The problem though arises in maintaining that curiosity, which I'll get to later.

5) **The very few times I have been more or less focused, my memory/retention power was fairly good. But take this with a pinch of salt, because this has only happened a couple times and I don't have anything to compare to.** I just know that I had this one moment, one day when my focus happened to be good that ""ohmygod I can memorize so easily???? I just need to understand and read properly, say it over and over in my head, and then after I'm done with the whole thing (eg-1 chap or wtv my target is) I just need to go over the everything multiple times really quickly, for about half an hour or an hour max. I knew adhd impaired my ability but by this much????"". But here's the problem, I may have overestimated my memorization abilities because I was used to shit memory as I was constantly distracted. So maybe this just looked rosy in comparison. Maybe there are a lot of people who can memorize as well, I don't think it was anything out of the blue. Not to mention, the fact that I have no clue about the avg person's memorization ability doesn't exactly help.

6) **Verbal intelligence?** I am supposedly very good at explaining complex topics with words. But I don't personally give a lot of weightage to this point. The point in itself is true but at the same time, I don't have a great vocab and in general am not as good with words as some people are.

**Argument- Against**

1) **Don't know if I'm good at, anything other than analysing complex situations, like reasoning, understanding concepts, etc.**

2) **I am not as driven or motivated as gifted kids are.**

3) **I lose curiosity** after a day of falling into a rabbit hole that, for a whole day, fulfilled me like nothing else. I cannot channel my curiosity like most gifted people can.

**Conclusion**

Possible theories-

**1) I am a bit intelligent but not enough to be gifted.**

**2) I am exceptionally intelligent but only when it comes to analysis in depth and not with other things.**

**So according to you am I intelligent or not? if yes, what area? Is it possible to be really good in one area but fairly average when it comes to others?**",0

"if you could get rid of in society Which if these if you had the power to get rid of in society that you feel is the most problematic which would you choose

But know this if you get rid of something that can cause problems in another part of society 

For example if you got rid of HIV alot of people would love their jobs and alot more would be possibly homeless  because at the end of the day hiv is a business a big cog in the machine

Let's say you get rid of pollution everyone start walking , or get ready to give up most technology . 

Or world peace and we get invaded by aliens and the wipe us out or enslave us because we are to docile to fight back 

Idk if you want to add what do you think would be the consequences of your choice I would love to hear

"Constant need for stimulation, any ideas? Hey!   
Since i've been young it seems like i always need some form of stimulation, everything from learning to listning to music. - It seems like it serve no purpose other then me getting satisfied. I have been in talks with my doctor about ADHD / ADD before and seems very unlikely, i displayed no symptose when i was younger, nor now (23 now). - Pluss, i've never really been hyperactiv.  
So for me it seems more like a dopamine-hunger then anything else. Anyone else go the same? - What i am actually saying, i have a low tolerance for bordom, but it doesn't seem to be ADHD/ADD, any ideas of what else it can be?  


Or the doctor kinda threw away ADHD, but i displayed some form for attention lack, but  that is with tasks i feel is very easy or in general boring. If it is something i am interested in or find enjoyfull i can sit for hours upon end with music and work on. - I also talk extremely  fast, up to the point that strangers sometimes have a hard time understanding me. - I've also been like this my whole life, my teachers used to tell me ''It sounds like you swallow some of your words when you talk'', haha. I don't know if that is a correlation or not.",0
"I’ve lost my curiosity I used to be extremely curious, and I loved learning. Today, I love the idea of learning, but I find learning itself boring and worthless.

"What should I do with my summer? After 12 years attending the same private school 12 miles away from my home, I (M17) will soon finish this chapter of my life. Or should I rather say, prologue? I was diagnosed as gifted at age 7, and my life has been rather uneventful all througout. This school I've attended had at most 50 students in my grade, and whilst in the past I used to have friends, in the recent years they've been replaced by drug-addicts, nihilists, generally unpleasant and useless people you wouldn't want to share your life with.

That being said, I feel as though I have thrown away my entire childhood and adolescence. I barely ever went out with friends when I had them (thanks to distance, mainly) and as previously stated, they all left the school anyway so that left me all alone with nonsensical, hedonist youngsters with whom I could never relate to. Sometimes, I wish I were as reckless and careless about life as my counterparts. In truth, I have no good memories of having fun with friends (outside of school, that is) and I spend several hours every day doing absolutely nothing. Literally, I just sit down and talk to myself for hours on end. Don't we all here, though?

My hobbies do not fill me and consist of: reading about everything, keeping up with the latest political news, lurking on Reddit and Quora, watching YouTube about anything, learning foreign languages, engaging in discussions with people, gossiping, laughing about others' misery whilst denying my own and playing videogames.

The truth of the matter is I am virtually alone. I genuinely envy children who go to the public school in front of my house, and those who are members of the local football club from a young age - I literally have 0 contacts in my own town. Only the same 50 guys I've had to tolerate for years. It really kills me to see other early adults having the time of their lives while I'm here as if on house arrest all day long. My real problem is I barely ever meet new people.

But everything is about to change. Adulthood is fast approaching, and so is what many have fantasized as my ""last free summer"" before university. In my mind, though, I know it will be just like the others: I will waste countless hours doing unfulfilling things that will amount to nothing. From my point of view, I have hit rock bottom, and the only way my life can turn is up. My life philosophy is that, while I may be losing a battle, I will win the war so long as I don't give up, because I genuinely believe in myself, and I just know that after September, I am guaranteed to succeed and meet people who I'll find agreeable.

So I guess my question would be, how can I make the most out of the next 3 months of summer? How can I meet locals around my age during summer? Should I do anything special to prepare for university? What do you all do in your free time?

TL;DR: Gifted M17 has no friends and is going to university after summer. Needs advice on how to survive the monotony of having nothing to do for 3 months.",0
"Why do most people seem to have a competitive nature to them? I've been reflecting on my conversations with most people and I noticed this pattern with most people. Anytime I bring up something that I'm working on (new ideas, creative projects, plans, new skills) then people seem to think that I am trying to be competitive with them. It's like I can't just share what I'm doing without something taking my self improvement as a personal attack at them. I guess it comes down to this. 

I share information and current events in my life as a way to be personable, friendly, and open to another person. It's like my way of letting them in my life, a form of vulnerability. But it seems like most people only share information to appear a certain way, very ego based and focused. 

I just want to scream that I don't care about any of that. I care about bettering myself and working towards the future. I don't care about social status, reputation, and competition. Why do most people care so much about meaningless things? I just don't get it. I know it has to do with ego development. I guess I'm more just upset that I have difficulty connecting with most people because they see me for someone else. Like I'm not competing with others. I'm competing with myself.",0
"Learning isn’t fun anymore I feel like being labeled “smart” stops me from enjoying the learning process. Whenever I do anything and impress people with my skillset or experience, they then expect impressively high levels of achievement constantly. I’m held to a much higher standard than others — despite having less formal training or education due to my background and income. And people seem incredulous whenever I make a human error, don’t know the answer, or I’m too exhausted or sick to do intellectual backflips that day. Its like some people think I’m some kind of human knowledge machine.

I feel like I then can’t simply enjoy the learning process. It’s no fun because once people decide you’re gifted at one thing — or worse, gifted at several — they start expecting a performance each time they see you, shove you in leadership roles, teaching roles, and it starts to feel like a job rather than just something you just wanted to do for leisure — just like everyone else. It also bothers me that society tends to expect perfection just because you demonstrate knowledge, talent or skill.

Has anyone else had this experience? How do you handle it? I’m an introvert and hate being put on the spot this way. I find myself hiding my degree of knowledge in certain areas, just to spare myself the spotlight and demands. Or just dropping out of activities altogether.",0
"down with the flood I hope some one one kinda found something for this or at least experiences the same.

I got told i was 'gifted' in high school after a whole bunch of tests, because i was kind of a problem at school. I got an insanly big discrepancy in my tes back than which explained a bunch of my problems. 

I got psychological help for a depression and for dealing with the whole feeling part of being 'gifted'. I kinda learned to deal but was maybe to young or to stubborn to take it in back than. 

So mow ten years later i stuck with still a lot of stuff, the following being a part of that.

I regularly get flooded by emotions not a particular emotion or feeling. More. Like a blender of feelings and emotions and it can make me feel like a bottle of coke that's on the brink of bursting.

It gets so much that it is paralyzing and i have no idea how to out it because nothing seems fitting to the feeling. Screaming wouldnt be enough, in no words can i describe the feeling its just like im going to burst but much more.",0

sometimes ppl said I am smart but deep down I know I am not. Even though sometimes I might do some more advance stuff that my age usually do, but I don't think I am gifted anymore. I wasn't gifted in the first place. But then I am not so sure. 

I have accepted (or trying to) that I am perhaps just an average students. It feels really bad though, knowing that I am never really gifted...?

"Do you get weird dreams that teach you things? Often I have dreams that are very symbolic. They are super intense and dramatic to the point that I'll wake up remembering everything that happened in them. Even the conversations and random things that appear. The crazy part is that I'll be ""Conscious"" in these dreams too. Like my inner monologue is the same when I'm awake and asleep in the dream world.

Last night though, it was one of those dreams that was especially intense. One of the conversations that I had was with my mother. I don't know why but I started arguing with her. She had told me something that triggered an anger inside of me. I told her ""You wonder why all of your kids are leaving you and don't love you. Well this is why. These are the things that you do that make it so hard to love you.""

After I said that, she started to completely degrade me. Pointing out my insecurities, failed romantic relationships, and even told me that all I was good for was to be manipulated and used by people. That's when she pointed out how none of my old friends ever respected me.

I told her, ""You wonder why I never had real relationships? It was because you never showed me what healthy love looked like and so I took scraps for love. It was always your fault for my abuse.""

She stopped and told me to look into her eyes. It was weird. I looked and her eyes were blackened. The more I stared, it was like I saw other spirits inside of her. A reptilian-like demon was inside of her and it morphed her face temporarily. Then the soul of a previous abusive friend entered her after. It was like my mom was there physically but not in spirit. Just pure darkness.

We stopped arguing because my sister was in the other room and started breaking down from everything that she heard. My sister was so angry that my mom told me all of that.

But it was really weird.

After she calmed down, she came over to me to tell me something. It was her physically but not her spirit. It was someone else inside of her body. She said this,

""Standing up for yourself was good but I have one question. Do you fight to win or do you fight to prove?""

Dream ends.

I had to reflect on this all morning.

All of those spirits that entered my mother were people who I always felt the need to prove myself to. I had to prove how strong I am. And so I would fight to prove my strength. And another part of me wants to always win to show that I am not weak.

I think this is what I am being asked to let go of.

I don't need to prove myself to anyone. I don't need to win.

This dream was so emotionally triggering for me. Once I realized that the argument with my mother was about myself feeling the need to prove myself, I literally couldn't stop crying.

Anyone else relate to these weird type of dreams. Also, sorry for the long post.",0

"Has anyone else completely derailed their life? I'm pretty much alone and mentally ill all of the time. I keep busy with ""personal projects"" lol but if I'm being honest, they don't fulfill me. Sometimes I'll get so wrapped up in something only to realize I've learned what I want to learn and it's not going to get me anywhere... which I know on one hand doesn't matter, but I'm directionless. I've probably developed an unhealthy level of maladaptive daydreaming to live in due to this ""lifestyle.""

There's just something inside of me that has *completely* disintegrated and I don't know if I'm capable of getting it back. I'm a living blob, but my mind is never silent and that's a problem because I feel like I can't get to a clear place of reset. I have absolutely zero energy to do most basic tasks, but crave stimulation, and I carry around a contradictory empty weight all of the time. I force myself to leave my house and then I need to be alone with my thoughts. I sit at home and ruminate and can't really reach the full extent of my thoughts, projects, experiences, or goals. I push things, I push them incredibly far because I subconsciously calculate how I can get out of them, and then I don't... but then I find a way, so I'm constantly hanging onto to this very fragile, teetering space of life where I'm not really living. It's hard to feel moved by anything anymore because I'm constantly snatching up the little pieces that I can get.

There is a wall. I think I have a catch-22 mental block of feeling like I'm old and wasted all of the time that was meant for me to develop myself and my life. I'm 25 and I just can't believe I am the way I am. I feel worthless and pathetic, and it's not just about accomplishments. I just feel like I haven't been and can't be who I could be, and who I want to be. The straightforward answer would be to make those changes. Even though I contemplate all of the potential directions I could go in detail, I can't execute them because of various reasons, which sounds like an excuse and I guess it is. The pandemic has also been a complete mindfuck in terms of time. I've spent a good chunk of what was supposed to be a formative time inside, breeding and fostering this ridiculous mindset.

I used to be social but now most social interactions are quite painful internally. I feel the need to fib to most people about myself and what I'm doing, just to cover up the fact that I'm the biggest disappointment of everyone I know, although it's pretty obvious. I'm the sad example of someone we've all watched go downhill for a while, occasionally bopping up and excelling for a short period of time, but never really thriving.

The only thing I can hang onto for any small sort of self-preservation is the fact that I know I can be capable and I believe that there is something that's ""worth it."" I have barely anything to show for it, so it's pretty near worthless, but I'm able to learn and understand and appreciate the underlying beauty in things. I just also... can't *do*? There is a huge block in my mind that zaps me of energy to do much of anything. So that's where I am. Hanging onto this small glimmer of hope that's probably based on something I don't really have, or may not exist.",0

"Intense emotions I (22F) went to a therapist a while ago and she told me I am gifted after talking for only ten minutes. I took the Mensa test and scored 131 (made it very quick and wasn’t serious about it). 

I have always felt different, but never really struggled with making friends. I can adapt to people, but often have to hold myself in (funfacts, corrections, talking slower, etc). I can be surrounded by friends, but still feel alone. 

I am also very emotional. I struggle with our society because there are many things I don’t understand. Maybe I rationalise too much. But I keep wondering why people do what they do, especially people my age. They drink a lot, do drugs, have sex with people they don’t even love and like to play ‘cool’, for example by driving recklessly or throwing trash on the streets. Many aspects of society, like fashion, i do not understand. I think it is hypocrite. I love animals and I am not even able to hurt a spider (i put them outside). I am also quickly overstimulated. I had a mental breakdown at a festival last week because it caused my faith in humanity to drop drasticly and i can’t even explain what was going on in my head at that moment. I cried and I was shaking. I went home and made a puzzle, by myself, which everyone thought was weird but i really enjoyed.

I tend to think that this world is simply too cruel for me. Maybe it is part of being gifted, idk. 

I also struggle with finding a boyfriend, especially because I don’t feel a real connection with anyone. I dated a lot but never felt anything. I simply don’t care about looks, I just want someone that actually cares as much as I do, and someone who is intelligent. Someone who also likes to go to museums and likes to expand their knowledge. However, this is hard to find. There is one guy I really like, he is also gifted and very depressed atm. 

I am curious about your experiences with this.",0
"Losing giftedness during teen years...? I am a 14 yo boy. I was labelled as ""gifted"" when I was 10, when my primary school nominated me and two other student to an organisation called ""HKAGE"" (if you would like to google that?) and I was told that I am ""gifted in science/maths"". For most of my last few years in my primary school (or elementary school for the other ppl who use that term?), I have always been good at science (not so much for maths though). 

Then my years in secondary school (or middle school), I got full mark once in a school science exam (but I am used to getting objectively ""good grades"")  and I am used to ppl asking me help for science or computing homework (usually just programming stuff). and then covid and puberty hit, I became bit more lazy, spending my time watching youtube, watching tv etc. I mean, I am still the few that answer question during the days of online school in maths/science/computing lesson but overall, I became more lazy.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I moved from Hong Kong to UK. Got into a public school. Getting around 90% in maths, science, computing and music (I play flute and violin). However, I failed one of my maths exam, so I moved from top ability set math class to second top set. This made me becoming more and more insecure about my intelligence. I continued to learn, I learned calculus, linear algebra, quantum physics (learned bit when I was 10 though) etc. I thought that would make me feel better.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with social anxiety, selective mutism (probably autism too according to my parents). and because of this, I struggle to communicate with ppl. Therefore, I have no friend at all. And also, sometimes I felt frustrated having to wait for others in Maths class. 

In 2022, I did a Mensa Home IQ test and I got around 118 IQ (but the test is for adults though). Given the fact that giftedness is defined as those who have IQ of higher than 130 (sometimes higher but not often to be lower). Does this indicate that my giftedness is ""disappearing""?  It is also worth noting that I never did a proper in my life, I was ""diagnosed"" by my school that I am gifted. 

&#x200B;

so the question is:

1. am I losing my giftedness?
2. if so, how can I maintain it?
3. or am I even gifted in the first place...?
4. approach to making friends that can match my intellectual needs?
