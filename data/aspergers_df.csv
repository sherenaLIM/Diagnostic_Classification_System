**So, /r/aspergers, what projects do you have on the go right now? Any ideas on the backburner for one reason or another? Any ideas just in the planning phase?** Even if you are working on them with someone else, they still apply here. If you can mention the interest that you have that relates to the project, that would be great; it may help others.",1
"I need to prepare both mentally and physically for a long time just to go on a casual outing. Can you relate? The only time I agree to go out with people is when I have been given a lot of notice. Even if it’s just a casual outing that seems like nbd to most people. 

For example I am going with my SO to his friends house for a dink in a few days and I can’t stop thinking about it. What am I going to wear? How will I respond if they ask me this question or that question? I prepare to meet friends like I’m preparing to go for an interview (don’t even get me started about how I prepare for an actual interview) I feel this is not normal. I’m new to this sub.

Also, if I run into someone spontaneously like someone visits without telling me or I see someone out and about or my husband forgets to tell me that someone’s coming by - I am a completely different person, like I don’t know how to socialize and I am so awkward. I’ve even hidden in the bathroom or bedroom a few times and told my husband to say I’m not home. I feel horrible and like I am so fucked up for this. If I’m forced to interact I feel like they think I’m a completely different person from when I have had time to prepare",1
"I hate TikTok Autism clout-chasers   All these people on TikTok who claim Autism in their bios and some of the parents or Autistic children on these media sites make me sick. Both faking Autism or using it as a cash platform is so perverse. It is not great, it is not enlightening, it is not a blessing. For most afflicted people it is a terrible thing to live with and absolutely debilitating at the least. You get a few of us with Aspergers who MAYBE get lucky and have a decent outcome but even then it’s worse because we have the symptoms that disrupt our way of life while simultaneously being self-aware enough to see that we are not normal which is an existential tragedy. If you’re someone who’s faking it or a parent who’s trying to make themselves feel self-righteous in a narcissistic manner in which you have a narcissistic God-complex competing with other parents to elevate your status then I hope you feel very bad about yourself.",1
"Anyone have trouble sleeping because of a hyper active brain? It's not just falling asleep at night. When I wake in the middle of the night, I just start thinking about random things. The only things that worked in the past (benadryll nightly, which I think was really bad for me in the long term), xanax/lunesta. Melatonin helps sometimes, and that only helped me fall asleep, not stay asleep.

I do all the right sleep hygiene except for one thing: I need to watch/listen to something to fall asleep. I have tried so many times without it, but I just lie away for hours. Listening to a podcast stops my active brain. It's like my thoughts get drowned out by hearing something else.

I have mild sleep apnea, CPAP doesn't do anything for me. Was never diagnosed with central apnea or anything. My latest ENT seems to think I'm not worth looking into, because I'm not overweight, and my AHI is low (around 6).

But I really suspect that I have something neurological going on. Are there neuro sleep specialists? I had my diagnosis of aspergers in 2020, but she said I didn't have ADHD.

EDIT: Wow, I'm so happy this sub is so active and responsive! Thanks everyone!",1
"How would you feel if someone told you, regarding your special interest, ""You are weird and obsessed""? It is a sincere question.

"Autism is a curse and I hate having something that ruined my life. It is NOT and NEVER will be a gift so stop sugarcoating it. But if you had different and better experiences, then good for you. The last subreddit I posted this venting story, a lot of people there in the autism community were happy with themselves with the condition and that's good for them. However, I think very differently; I'm not glad to be born with this condition at all. Be honest with me in the comments: if you were all given a choice to be normal or disabled, would you choose the latter at all? You can call me an ableist all you want, but I am ripping on everybody including NTs and autistics and this is my story:

(I know that this story is very long, but if you wish to make any type of commentary, then please just read from the beginning all the way up to the end.)

I was diagnosed at 3 or 4 and ever since I got into elementary school, I was always supervised by an adult, and other kids at my school weren't. I never knew why and that answer was revealed to me in my high-functioning special ed social skills elective class during 6th grade that I have an autism disorder. Which explained why I was treated so differently during my youth by the adults at my school. This also explains why my social life sucks to this day. Whenever I go to social gatherings, I'm always considered to be awkward, I got treated like crap growing up, and so on. Autism affects every single aspect of your life and not even in a good way. In elementary, I had to go through some home session meetings after school, I was supervised during class, and I did shit academically. The first thing I mentioned about this whole home session shit and this whole gov paper shit my parents had to pay for was the reason why I wasn't able to pour my energy into meaningful extracurriculars such as sports, instruments, and so on. The only time I remember doing that was during summer break when I didn't have school, but it still felt like I was doing a lot less compared to my peers. But at least many kids in elementary were nice to me and I actually liked my peers at the time. Maybe I was just oblivious back then, but I don't care because I generally had a good relationship with my friends and I didn't hate that many people back then. Not to mention that a lot of us tend to be sensory sensitive because of the fact of how our brains are larger than neurotypicals' by 20%, and even though I have built up a lot of tolerance for that over the years, it still does feel like shit whenever I personally get yelled at by people nonetheless. Middle school came and my academics start to improve dramatically so I wanted to be in the honors program and my grades allowed for that to happen. But some of the counselors thought that I would fail and fuck up if I joined those honors classes and I had the fucking IEP that prevented me from doing that. All my teachers and this high-functioning special education teacher who followed me around during some of my classes have hyped me up about joining the honors program next year and gave me false hope about that so fuck those adults.

Because of that, I was stuck in regular classes for all three years of middle school and I was not happy with it. At my middle school, about 90% of the kids who went there were enrolled in the gifted magnet program that allowed them to be in honors classes and many of my friends there were in that very program. In fact, I only had two or three friends who weren't in that magnet program. Just like many schools, in regulars or easier classes, since it's not too hard and we're only asked to do the minimum, there were only manner-less punks who caused trouble all the time and those who didn't even want to do that very minimum. I'm not saying that everybody who is in regular classes is like that and I have met people who were in those gifted or honors classes who were total douchebags too. Maybe they were just kids back then and perhaps they didn't know better at the time. After all, it was in middle school, the place and time where they have the most toxic age group: teens. If any of you reading this is a teen in middle school, high school, or college as an 18-19-year-old, there are always people who judge you on petty bullshit, who fight, act up, gossip, and think they're better than everyone and I think you know who I am talking about. Although for college, not so much I suppose. But the magnet program at my middle school had more variety of people and I was surrounded by people who were just outright terrible only, which includes both the scummy magnet kids and the bad regulars class kids (the magnet kids and the regulars kids shared PE together), and that still affects me today to a certain extent. I also had a crush on a girl who was in that magnet program and unfortunately, I still do to this day, although it is getting weaker gradually as the year passes. I delude myself that I'll see her again in the far future and I know that'll never happen but that is the only thing that keeps me sane to this day. So I ended up knowing people from my middle school in fucking high school but those populations have only been about 1/8 of the magnet kids from middle school at the maximum and that girl I liked was not part of that 1/8.

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't find anybody new who was beautiful or my type in high school, so I didn't get over my middle school crush. Also, it is NOT that easy to find somebody else, not just because we tend to cling to what we like, but because of the fact that many of these new people may not be better in appearance, personality, and other fields than your old crush. But acceptance mostly. I don't know about how you guys judge attractiveness, but I had a crush on that girl for who she was as a person too. I'll admit that I've never talked to her too much and had very little interaction with her in 6th grade PE, but I still did hear that she was pretty chill and we knew of each other's existence. But for someone new, unless you have the same classes with her (or him if you're a girl) in high school or college, then you wouldn't interact with anybody else too much and with our below-average social skills. And besides, even if you do find someone new, what are really the chances that your new crush would like you back with that very problem anyways? Slim to none. I'm not saying that I would have gotten to know my crush in middle school better even if I did have a chance to talk to her more, but I'm just saying that if there is anyone you develop a crush on but you don't often interact with that person so much, it's just not gonna work out. Your chances get even worse when there's the fact that you haven't interacted with each other to the point that the other party doesn't even know that you exist, has not heard your name even once, and doesn't hear anything about you at all. This is more of the reason why it's so hard to find someone new. I mean, why should you even expect somebody completely new who you've only known for about a week at the most to accept you for who you are compared to your old peers who have known you for longer than a school year? Regardless of what your relationship status was with him/her. It doesn't matter if you didn't talk or interact with each other too much, or even if you guys were enemies at worst, but if you've technically known each other for that long, you usually get used to that person and their habits whether you like it or not. It's the same with people living in dangerous areas, or even seeing other weirdos at school: if you spend time with and get used to someone or something in your situation for a long time, you get used to it, and becomes natural to you regardless of how you initially felt about that matter. I hope the latter is something many others here could relate to too, cuz I'm pretty sure everyone, even autistics, has had these feelings at one point in their lives. I am not that good with words, but I am trying my best to convey this.

Surely, everybody knows that high school relationships and friendships (although this one tends to last a lot more than romantic relationships) don't go anywhere, let alone middle school and elementary school ones, and we all know that unless you've known somebody from your school for quite a long time, still live near you or go to your current school or your workplace, or if you've gotten along with your friends like brothers or sisters, then you wouldn't really keep in touch with your friends from school at all. Even if you still do, those numbers are usually about 2-3, or maybe even 4-6  at the most. When you go out and hang out with your friends riding your own car or one of your friends' cars, 6 does seem like a huge number, but it still is relatively small if you compare that with everybody in your school yearbook in your grade or your age. Maybe even compared to your friend group at the time, depending on how big it was. But still, the time you guys spend together and the memory you guys share are priceless and you can't buy that with anything as you can't go back in time, and I never had that many relationships to even begin with, especially with my crush from middle school. That took a humongous toll on me during my high school life and I never really acted normally or happily, letting my autistic self come out a little bit more than I should have controlled and that resulted in me getting rejected by many people and considered awkward by some who I thought were my friends from middle school. Because I didn't cope too well with that, I missed a lot of the opportunities I could have possibly had in high school. That same year I became a high school freshman, my beloved cat died too so that did not help me at all either. In fact, that added fuel to my depression and sadness. Especially because she died while I was away in Japan to see some family and I did not get to have a better and proper closure with her.

But fortunately for me, I was somehow able to turn my life around when I decided that I wanted to play trumpet and baseball during my remaining high school life and although it did not go the way I wished it would, I still regained many people's friendship and was somehow able to turn my life around at the last moment. However, I am still considered to be awkward even in my college life and people take note of that, and I don't know if I could do that miracle again just like in my last years of high school. I do all these extracurriculars many people did in their youth like some sports, an instrument, another language, martial arts, etcetera as a college student but the experiences aren't really the same and I still really can't relate to many people with my compromised social skills and my lack of common experience. So even if I did meet people from my past again in the future, I don't know if I could really reestablish a friendship because of those factors. Many tell me that I should completely move on and find someone new and all, but you meeting somebody from your school again in a whole new setting is not too uncommon and I say this from experience. Not to mention that those new people you meet in your new setting also experienced many things you and I didn't do during their childhood and their school time. If those new people and your old schoolmate were to meet, they would definitely have an easier time bonding with each other than me bonding with my old schoolmate again in the future at any time. As I said earlier, especially with romantic feelings, it's immensely harder to find someone new than to find a new friend. I personally find friendships a lot easier than romance, although that still does suck even though I am doing better than in my past. If you find something you weren’t able to do in the past and you want to find out what it is or are genuinely into that activity, then I say go for it. But whatever you do, do NOT think about doing it to catch up to people’s experiences because you’ll know they will always have different experiences and with that mentality, you will never be able to do that activity without feeling inferior to other people and your happiness in doing that will be there only for so long.

I am one of the rarer autistics who actually does go to college, is capable of getting a part-time and a full-time job, able to drive without any problems, and so on, but neurotypicals who can do this have lives outside of school and work and I just don't know how to make that happen. And just because I can do all those things, it doesn't mean they're easy to do so. I still suck at picking up social cues, saying something excessive, being impulsive with my words, and understanding the situation to list a few, but I don't know how to fix those. As stated earlier, I am actually one of the rarer extremely high-functioning types who's extremely close to normal to the point where I know that I'll always be missing something and never will be a completely normal person, as much as that sounds ironic right now. People always tell me that I should accept myself for who I am, but you really can't do that when a great majority of others don't. Especially in my family, my dad is just super hard on me at times and gets mad if I miss just one teeny expectation so how the fuck am I supposed to accept myself for who I am? My parents (my dad a lot more than my mom) also always tell me stuff like ""What are others gonna think if you do this or that?"" or ""People are gonna think you're somebody crazy like those homeless people on the streets"" whenever I do talk to myself (I do this a lot less now) or something ""autistic"",  and you're always excessively encouraged to hide those traits like that and you're even punished for failing to do so at times, so it pretty much is impossible to accept yourself because a great majority of others do not, not even your own family. As much as I do think it is important to fix the awkwardness that my autism causes, I still think being excessive about it and others bickering too much about that to our faces makes that stressful as fuck, even if that wasn't their intent. Even if you do accept it yourself, you can only go so far and play defense for so long until that finally loses its effect over time. Even if you do hear shit from other people like ""who cares about what other people think because you're you"" or tell yourself ""I am who I am and if you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself"", which are all true to an extent, you're still gonna be alone, rejected, and be yelled at by people at the end of the day. You still need some acceptance as we're humans and are social creatures, so you're gonna need that to be happy and it's important just like food, water, or a place to live are for human survival. 

Neurotypicals expect so much from us socially and if we miss even one of their standards, they treat us like we're deficient and it's the end of the world because we high-functioning folks are seen as ""not too severe"" or ""not that badly autistic"". But at the same time, they don't ever reach over for us when we need something and they constantly ostracize us from their own personal lives because we're ""too awkward and inept"". Do you see the double standards right there? Do any of these sound familiar to you at all? As much as I think merely working hard is not enough for your work and results are what matter the most to be accepted in society and I usually do take a very conservative approach on that, I also think you need some recognition for what we've been doing to try to fit into society because this whole masking shit is hard enough already. This is pretty much why I think my life would have been a lot better without autism ruining my social life. No, scratch that, it already has been different if I weren't autistic, and masking our autism in social situations and what happens when we do that are perfect proofs of that. Life is already unfair and hard enough for neurotypicals, but we also have this burden that limits us from the basic things neurotypicals can do in their daily lives, making ours twice or thrice as hard and we don't need that. A gift is supposed to make our lives easier, not harder like autism.

I've had relationships implode because of my awkwardness and my inability to read cues and I don't want that anymore in my life. If you neurotypicals point that out to me and/or just outright avoid me, why don't you guys actually tell me what the problem is with me and describe how you guys think it could be resolved? If you're gonna say shit like that to people like us, then we at least deserve to know what's wrong fully so we can at least try to work on it. But many don't and talk behind your back because they think it's rude to do so, they're scared to tell us honestly, or they think they don't have the obligations to tell us and think we're not entitled to an explanation, or whatever the reason may be. I know that people are just notoriously bad at telling you things, but if you have the guts to point that out in front of the entire crowd, you might as just well tell us what's wrong with us and how you guys think it can be addressed so we can at least try to work on it and I have made numerous improvements and growths in fields I suck with whether it be social skills and cues, academics, and so on, so there's no way we won't improve if we were told. I'll admit I may get defensive at first when told honestly to my face, but if you offer advice as well, I could at least appreciate the honesty, no matter how aggressive and hostile the person's demeanor is in doing so. It's the same with customer service and review: if you're gonna leave a 1-star review about a certain restaurant, at least write why in detail it was bad so that the owner could make it better for his or her next customer and you can't just expect him/her to read your mind cuz he/she ain't a freakin' psychic. This is one of the things I cannot understand about neurotypical people in general.

Just to let you guys know, many of those people I'm talking about are liberals and leftists and many of them talk about equality, acceptance, and other gay SJW bullcrap and I know this because I'm from Los Angeles, one of the most liberal places on Earth. I'll tell you that these people do not accept autistics and even if they say that they do to your face, they'll make it clear through action that they do not every chance they get. So you're telling me, you people rather accept people who are sexual deviants like the LGBTQ+ and their groomers, pedophiles, decadents, and leftist terrorists over someone who genuinely struggles with something they're born with and cannot help it? What an inclusive society we live in am I right? I'm not saying that conservatives and right-wingers are more accepting of us, but at least they don't pretend to care when they don't.  This is pretty much why I can't let people know the true me because, from past experiences, there are no benefits in coming out. I'll remind you, it's not so much about accepting yourself, it's about others accepting you as well.

Speaking of having no benefits coming out to people, another bullshit piece of advice I get from others around me is just to ""be myself"". I'm pretty sure everyone who has ever lived on this Earth - both neurotypicals and autistics included -  has received this advice too at one point in their lives. But the real question is, what the hell does being yourself even mean? Really. Does it mean just be yourself as long as it's not too deviant? To all these people who have told me this: what did you really mean by ""just be yourself""? Is that what you were trying to convey to me? But putting aside whatever they were trying to tell me at that time, the advice of ""just be yourself"" is just the most bullshit advice anyone in this world can receive. From personal experience, you do not want to know anybody 100% because you see their ugly side too and everyone knows that everyone has a dark side that they try their best to hide. We who are autistic do see that very ugly side of other people around us because of the way they act towards us whether we like it or not, unfortunately. Probably because we're ""socially unaware"" and people do try to take advantage of that and nobody would ever properly reprimand them because we're the ones who act ""weird"". But going back to this whole ""be yourself"" bs, you actually do NOT want to know other people 100% because as stated earlier they have a dark side or a secret or two that just turns you off. If the whole world knows who everyone is 100%, then the whole concept of public and private would not even exist in the first place. Even neurotypicals who are reading this and ones who are actually decent and level-headed would tell you that this ""be yourself"" advice is absolute bullshit. There is a certain norm in the world and if you do defy that even by the slightest, you would be given a blank stare or worse depending on the situation. Plus, we’re pretty much like the only one who suffers from autism or other neurodivergence, which means we’re the minority out of the minority, so that ain’t gonna work out too well. 

And about love, good luck ever finding that if you're autistic cuz it's hard for us as we're seen as lower than and if we do, it's because they either feel bad for us, they're simply taking advantage of us (especially if we do become rich miraculously, women who would give a fuck about us would be gold diggers only), or they're trying to show the world how much of a ""good"" person they are to feel better about themselves just like those cringy degenerate SJW morons. The last one technically does go under the second one of taking advantage but that was pretty vague by itself with only one example so yeah. People can even make inspiration porn with the last option. If you do find legitimate love, then good for you and all I'm saying is that it's harder for us autistics with love, which is something even neurotypicals find hard to maintain.

I also have this whole regional center support shit I'm still in and that's where I get all my accommodations for school from but I have never really relied on them for extra help. I have to have these annual meetings virtually on Zoom or whatever program they wanna use and that just reminds me I'll never be a normal person, and my whole life and this whole support shit make that all fucking crystal clear. I tried requesting these coordinators some social skills classes that could help my awkwardness, which is the only bet that could help me socially, but these guys treat it with no sense of urgency and many of my personal coordinators just quit their jobs immediately. In fact, these guys even forgot to give me info regarding my wish and my annual meeting. Not to mention that they're also condescending and I can tell by the way they talk and act toward me. I may be autistic but at least I can pick up on stuff like that. I tried telling my mom about my whole thoughts on this and she was like ""you do know it's their reference that's getting you all these accommodations you need at school right? If you don't like it, we can quit any time but you can't reapply anymore as an adult. Otherwise, stop complaining because you need them"". Well, not exactly those words tho. I made it look really bad but you get my point tho right?

I'm stuck with this curse forever and lemme reiterate this to you, it's a CURSE. Autism has set me back many times and in many fields and it affected my mental state for years and will continue to do so in the future. Let's say there is a person who can't walk from birth and has to use a wheelchair or a cane to move from left to right and you call that inability to walk a gift. That guy is gonna get fucking pissed at you and would beat your ass if he could. I would like to use the hiking analogy and people who can't walk can't go all the way to the mountains and enjoy the beautiful views nature has to offer them and they can't take their wheelchairs or their canes with them there. It's the same with autism, it's a disability that limits communication and development and it has closed numerous doors of opportunities normal people can have to us and you're not always going to have help wherever you go or are at every time. I always hang out with my neurotypical friends because being alone doesn't work and whenever I do see them, many of them are doing some cool shit with their lives like playing college varsity level sports, being in any college band, helping out with movie productions, and for something smaller and a lot more common, some are conducting research and even making new discoveries at times, making a girlfriend (or a boyfriend if you're a girl), traveling abroad, winning awards for something, getting internships for a really good company, and so on, but many people around me seem to know what they're doing with their lives and make something out of it.

Even if those types of people do genuinely accept you from their hearts and think you're a cool and good person who’s fun to be with, you still feel inadequate because in many cases, our parents have to make us give up on our interests and put us in some special program so we could at least be close and try to fit into being ""normal"", so it's extremely hard not to feel inferior and inadequate compared to your peers. This is what I mean by a lack of common experience and even though people tell us to not compare ourselves with others, which is also true most of the time, it's hard not to do so, especially when those high-achieving people excel people like us in many fields, even in ones we show tremendous interest in whatever that may be for individual autistics. There are more than good enough reasons why autism is considered to be a disability and why these support services even exist in the first place.

Don't even get me started on autistics being with other autistics because that doesn't work either. If you put someone disabled with another person who also has shit conversation skills, it just naturally implodes and there are not any relationships from the beginning in the first place as both parties have such horrible communication skills. Or maybe one side has such bad communication skills and there's a huge disparity between the disability to the point where the more high-functioning one just gives up completely. Cuz that's what happened to me. I struggle to relate to other people with autism, as there were no follow-ups in conversations with them and I couldn't even have a basic conversation with them. Even with the good ones it just doesn't feel satisfying, no offense to other autistics. I basically just have to carry the relationship with them and I'm always the one who had to initiate the conversation, and I'm not interested in a one-sided relationship and friendship.

Many of them also live obliviously and are like children or teens in men's bodies so I cannot have serious life talks with a lot of them cuz they don't know what you're going through. I still struggle with some of these too but at least I am able to look back at my past and reflect on myself without people telling me that I was in the wrong because even if I were told that, I did not care at all most of the time and I still don't, depending on the situation I would be in for me to be told that now that I'm not a rebellious and cheeky teen anymore. Because these people who tell me that are the very ones who show their ugly sides and take advantage of me and they've shown me who they really are as people, so they're in no moral position to tell me such.  But overall, at least in that regard, I think I am a lot better off than most autistic people I have met at school and have grown up with because most autistics do live obliviously and move on with their lives completely, whereas I always look back at my past and always mumble to myself ""You/I shouldn't have said or done that as a person."" because it's a fact that I have done and said many fucked up and horrible things in my past I shouldn't have.  

Just like neurotypicals, they have double standards too at times and when you do ask them for help, many won't cuz they're too shy or too inept. I have also met autistics who were just outright scumbags who annoyed me, acted up in class, didn't read through the line, and argued with people, and they meant all that. I also forgot to mention that many can't take a joke by taking shit literally and killing the good vibe. The last point I want to make is that the way some of them hit on someone they're into is just way overt too. An example of that was when I was in 8th grade, there was a girl two years younger than me who also has autism and had a crush on me. The things she did to try to hit on me were excessively touchy and other annoying methods like trying to talk to me constantly many times. She was that stereotypical teenage bad girl who was rowdy and rebellious to her parents, teachers, and the entire society, always mad and grumpy, spoiled at times, having issues with her friends and peers around her, and just something you would see in stereotypical teenage girl movies and you add autism to that. I wouldn't say she was mean because I don't believe she had any malice in doing all the stuff she did to me and still wish for the best for her to this day, but it still was annoying nonetheless and I do believe she had real frickin' mental issues too. 

Now if this is a guy reading this, many would think that I should have been happy that a girl liked me and was showing signs (really obvious ones in the case of this autistic girl) and shit, but if you don't find that person who has a crush on you attractive not even by the slightest bit and inch, then what they do to you is nothing but pure annoyance and many people who are reading this, whether you're autistic or not, would agree with this as some may have experienced something similar to this themselves too, unfortunately. But then again, it's not their fault they are like that and all, but that just made me not wanna be with the people in that community.

Surely I have made some friends in my past special education elective classes during school, but most of those friends were people with ADHD, not autism. Going off another topic, but just like how the severest form of autism is nothing compared to the severest form of ADHD, the mildest form of ADHD is nothing compared to autism. I'm not trying to invalidate ADHD people's experiences but from personal experience, people with ADHD tend to be hyper a lot of the time and have trouble focusing in classrooms, but they are a LOT better in social situations than us autistics. They get to take some medication that helps them control their hyperactivity, but for autism, there probably is nothing similar to that. People with the severest form of autism usually cannot feed themselves and cannot go to the bathroom on their own, and they just can't live by themselves and that is not something the severest ADHD people go through in their adult lives. I know people can have both of these disabilities, but as I said earlier, people with ADHD only generally do better in their social lives whereas we don't have any lives outside of school and work, no matter how mild our autism may be. So, it's hard to really relate to anyone when we're like this, even with other autistics. Because ADHD people can actually relate to others, whereas autistic people usually cannot from my experience.

It's not even a community at all. To me, it's just a group of people who happen to have the same disability cuz it's every man for himself in this community as they don't really help each other out too much IRL. I have made peace with a lot of those disabled people who I had problems with in my past and I did reestablish somewhat of a relationship, but it's never really gonna be the same because I just have this knowledge that he/she won't help me and/or is oblivious in this area so I can't really deepen ties with him/her. But I'm also not gonna let go of someone who is a good friend if I later find out that he/she was autistic. I'm not going to say something like ""You're a good friend but you're disabled/autistic, so bye"" to the person if I found out later on in my friendship with him/her. I would feel really bad and shit about myself for who I am if one were to do that to me too. But at the same time, I'm not really gonna look into the autistic community for a good friend cuz it hasn't happened to me historically and I do NOT wanna hear this whole ""YoU DidN't TrY HaRd EnOuGh"", ""YoU'rE ThE PrObLeM"", ""YoU WeRE TOo HaRd oN ThEm"" type of comment. Because I tried as hard as anyone should. In fact, I tried more than I should have. You're the one who doesn't understand.

Although all of these aspects I have ripped on autistic people for are issues I still struggle with even to this day, like getting pissed easily and killing the good vibe, and I have even been a bully myself at times and have treated people like crap by calling them slurs and letting my own problems out onto people, it doesn't mean I want to choose someone to be friends with or even have a romantic relationship within the autistic community. From personal experience, any people who have something that's bad in common, their relationship turns to shit, it is especially true with autism and social skills and cues, one person and this other person who share those exact same issues, it's just a recipe for disaster and my relationship with 98% of other autistics I have met over the course of my life have actually been a lot worse than with those condescending and rejecting neurotypicals. But at least I can actually have basic conversations or even share one or two things in common way more with the latter. As I said earlier, I'm not saying that all autistic or neurotypicals are callous and outright scumbags because I have met decent people from both parties, nor am I saying that I'm superior to other autistic people in general. Because as I said earlier, I still struggle with many things I listed on how autistic people do socially too. After all, I have this condition myself too and I have ripped on neurotypicals and their issues too.

However, while I do feel like I am different from many neurotypicals I've been around since my childhood, I also feel too different from other autistic people too. Just like how many neurotypicals are diverse, unique, and different from each other, autistic people are individuals too, and one autistic man/woman is different and unique from another autistic person. In the latter case, as mentioned earlier, there are very big differences in the severity of autism depending on the person, and the issues faced are unique to each autistic person, so it's kinda hard to deal with other disabled people too when you're disabled yourself and are dealing with your own issues in your life at the same time. It's also hard to deal with other disabled people when someone is a lot more severe and can't even have very basic social interactions and communications as people. This is another significant reason why I think that the autism/Asperger's community is not really a ""true community"" to me personally, at all. But rather, a poorly organized group of people who happen to have a similar type of developmental disability.

What do you guys think? I wanna know in the comments below. I hoped this has enlightened some of you and I hope this serves as some sort of improvement for those who lack something I mentioned in the post. Because these things I mentioned that autistic people lack are vital for building a relationship as we're social creatures and being alone does not take you anywhere. I've tried that for a long time and it only works for a while until it finally starts to screw you up mentally. I don't want anybody to go through what I did. I hope everybody including autistic people would have a better childhood than me.

Also, I do NOT want to hear these types of comments where they say that the harms of ableism and trauma are more of something my rant fits into than autism struggles itself cuz that doesn't really help me at all. It doesn't help anyone at all. Saying stuff like that doesn't serve anyone long-term and people who struggle with autism do not improve at all from saying that. I have clearly stated what autistic people have issues with and what I have issues with personally, and I want people to improve on that and I want to improve on myself so you and I can have a better quality of life. Again, I'm pretty sure a lot of people here in this subreddit are happy with themselves with autism, but I think very differently.

True, nobody should bully or mistreat others just cuz they're different, and people around you mistreating and not accepting you just because you're different is an issue with how they are rather than with you yourself. But even if you don't get treated like crap openly by others, you still lack some skills neurotypicals have for granted like social skills and so on depending on each individual autistic person. As much as neurotypicals should be less judgmental, more understanding, and accepting, and do better in treating us with dignity and respect, autistics should learn to do better overall, adjust themselves gracefully as possible, and properly be punished and reprimanded for their bad actions because using one's disability to accept or condone morally unacceptable actions by saying stuff like ""give him/her a chance, he/she is disabled!"" doesn't do anyone including the disabled person him/herself a favor. That just isolates neurotypicals and autistic people even more.

I don't know about you guys but I currently do not plan to have any biological kids because we have a risk of passing down autism cuz there's a really strong chance that it may be genetic and/or hereditary. That means that I might pass down this faulty genetic makeup of mine to my own kids and they would have to go through the exact same types of suffering I have gone through as a kid. In fact, their disabilities might actually be worse than mine and I don't want to risk that as autism is a spectrum disorder with different levels of severity. I don't wish this on anyone, not even on my worst enemy, so why would I want my kids to have it and suffer as I did? That'll be very selfish of me to do so and I can't just go on and tell my kids that they were born just because I felt horny and had sex with my future wife when they question me about why they have to go through autism and why they had to be born if they do end up being autistic like me. About having kids, as much as I only want biological ones, I couldn't because of this.

So stop saying that there's nothing wrong with people who are disabled, that doesn't serve anyone.",1
"Why are ADHD and autism often bundled together? Excluding cases when the conditions are co-occurring, it's hard for me to understand how there's any similarity between the two and why they both fall under the ""neurodivergence"" category. Even if people with ADHD and autism could exhibit similar difficulties at times, it seems that their etiology is still wildly different.

I guess I'm more interested in the practical aspect of it though, like are you able to relate to people with ADHD? Do you usually make good friends with people with the condition? Do you participate in group therapies with people with both conditions? Any insight would be appreciated.",1
"Aspergers and Porn Hi There

I genuinely don't know if there is a link between these two things but I was hoping from insight from my fellow Aspys, both male and female on the matter.

I have been watching porn for a long-time now (since I was around 14, it was how I was first exposed to sex) and while I don't believe it's ever influenced my behaviour towards others or led me to develop a negative outlook I do find myself wondering whether it's normal.

For example I genuinely enjoy spending a few hours browsing the internet looking for the specific videos and photos that I'm after on that day, and enjoy having that intimate time by myself but I'm worried that might be abnormal.

I genuinely enjoy porn more than sex most of the time as I find it much easier, but I'm also worried that may be a bad thing too?

Either way thank you for reading my post, and thank you in advance if you decide to comment your thoughts or offer any advice",1
"How many jobs have we had? I’m 29(m) and sitting at 44. Jobs ranging from Sales to food delivery to factory to retail and my own small businesses. 

I was strict when tallying up and only counted gigs I’ve had & collected at least 1 paycheque. 

I went to university but dropped out and don’t regret that honestly. Reason 1 is that I had a good time there and experienced things my strict upbringing didn’t allow me. I’m no longer in contact with my family. Reason 2 is that I’d never have progressed in the field of study I chose because I now know that I don’t and will never possess the skills to play the corporate game or workplace politics effectively enough to carve out a decent path. I’m intelligent but I’m not smart. 

Reasons I haven’t lasted in jobs range from being managed out, social exclusion, bullying, insubordination, conflict, relocation and some just normal reasons. 

I’ve read that over 80% of us are unemployed. Just wondering how my 44 stacks up in comparison to some of us on here.

EDIT:

A) Thanks for your responses. It’s not a huge sample size but it’s helped me understand this topic a lot better. 

B) I should probably add that some roles were concurrent and some temporary. I’ve been lucky enough to work at a few major global sporting events for example so they last only for a few weeks. And I mentioned that I moved to different cities and towns for periods of time as well so they were only ever going to be stints. Even taking those out, it’d probably put me at around 30 in & around my home city which is still relatively high.

EDIT 2:

I’m black btw. I’m not sure how that would’ve affected the responses and I didn’t do this for dramatic effect. It initially just didn’t occur to me to mention. I’m fairly big and had an experience in my late teens of being a paid athlete… which is only  one of the 44 jobs I included. Even with my size and typical intimidating build I’ve endured bullying and the rest and on a couple of occasions I’ve had to use violence in self defence. I won’t reply any more but hopefully this provides food for thought for anybody that encounters this thread despite where we do or do not fall on the spectrum.",1
"Woman abuses her dog in front of me, and tries to hunt me down three days after I called her out on it Hello,

A few days ago while I was on my lunch break, I took a walk and noticed an older woman (looked around mid 60s) with her friend taking a walk with her dog. She was coming from an intersection and I was behind them for around 2.5 minutes. During that time, I noticed that every single time her dog was trying to take a poop, she would just very harshly tug on its collar for (dog was trailing right behind her, and would keep tugging everytime she felt the dog stop). I noticed that as time went on, the increments between each time the dog needed to poop got shorter, indicating that he really, really needed to go. As they were about to go off to the other trail, I caught up to them and said, “hey mam, you need to pay more attention to your dog because I’ve noticed that you’ve been tugging on his collar every time he needed to take a sh\*t, I think you should stop for him.” And I walked on, but as I walked away, all she said was, “well, hey NOW if you had just let me EXPLAIN…” but I wasn’t going to stand there and talk with a clearly crazy person and I think I embarassed her in front of her friend, to me, that was enough for her to finally actually let her dog take a poop so that was good enough for me.

Flash forward to literally just 2 hrs ago, I was walking and she came up to me and said verbatim, “are you that person who came up to me a few days ago?”

me: yeah, think so

her: I just want to ask you what made you think you could say that to me, and about that fact that YOU didn’t even let me explain

me: you really let that event live in your head rent free for three days?

her: excuse me?

me: you should get over it.

her: What is your name?

me, walking away: you really wanna know my name, Karen? Keep wondering.

Karen: ..Karen?

Upon hearing me say Karen, I saw a switch go off in this witch’s head and she whipped her phone out and started recorded me

Karen: I’m going to take a picture of your face and post it on every corner of the internet to let people know that YOURE a danger to people

I didn’t try to hide my face because I knew I didn’t do anything wrong, and when she took my picture she started to walk away, looking very pleased with herself. I then whipped out my own phone and started saying, “well, if you’re going to take a picture of me it’s only fair I get yours too, right?” Cue her panicking. As soon as I start recording, her demeanor changes and she starts trying act like a victim, saying I’m crazy over and over and “what’s wrong with you!” All while trying to hide her face. While I was recording her, she actually tried to hit me and knock the phone out my hand, and I caught it all.

Would I be ok if this were to be held up in court? all I did was tell this person not to abuse their dog (didn’t literally say that verbatim to her, but I’m pretty sure preventing a dog from pooing counts as abuse) and I’m guessing she got so embarassed because I humiliated her in front of her friend, that she tried to find me for three days to get her “revenge.” I never touched her, only when she tried to hit me I tried to put her hand away to stop her from smacking my head.

please feel free to ask questions or if you need clarification on some parts, this just happened to me too so I’m just also trying to process this. Thank you.",1
"Aspergers is an affliction that robs it's sufferers of a proper human experience. The human experience is a multifaceted journey that spans an entire life cycle. The human experience is one of modulation; generally, using different abilities to experience life, and to judge oneself in relation to it's environment. This modulation encompasses articulative social interaction; as, human observers articulate themselves in relation to others to gain new experiences. Aspergers as an affliction categorically inhibits the ability to socialize, as sufferers are unable to properly use the innate gift of social interaction.  Aspergers sufferers lack the innate human trait of proper socialization from their neurological abnormalities. The consequence of this, is that aspergers sufferers are forced to live an unbalanced human experience, in which they compensate their social ineptitudes with ""special interests"". For these very reasons, from birth those with aspergers are fleeced of a proper human experience, in which they are prevented from properly wielding their tongues with others. Whether or not one with aspergers is content with their condition, a proper human experience will always be somewhat unattainable. What a subtly degrading condition to be born with.

Edit: What I meant behind proper human experience. All human experiences are different, but most of them involve similar elements from a biological basis. There are simply a range of components that combine to create a human experience. Eating, sleeping, sex, thinking, and socialization are all examples of core experiences, and to be deprived of these experiences is deprivation of core components to perceiving and wielding life. A ""human experience"" can be aggregated by looking at a normal range of experiences, and those with aspergers don't fit the normal range that I listed. A very important part of the human experience for many people are their connections, which aspergers can inhibit the process to connect.

Edit 2: What I said about special interests was a bit inaccurate, what I really meant was that deficit in social abilities generally causes some kind of compensation, as it can cause you to find other ways to spend your time if one would normally spend their time socializing.",1
"My son is diagnosed… I need advises from other aspies. Hi All, My son is 15 years old and diagnosed for High Functioning ASD last year. This was after he attempt suicide. He was diagnosed for ADHD when he was 7 and he was under Methlyfenidate medication when it was hapenned. It was a shock for all family.

I’m trying to search about autism to be able to support him today and make possible for him a good life when we passed away. We love our son and his differences are just make him special.

My main concerns are listed below. But of course I’m missing something. Please add your comments. Appreciated for your time… 
Wish all of you the best.

- We couldn’t tell him his diagnosis. We were expecting to work on it with his therapists. So he will understand that there was always a reason for his confusion. He doesn’t want therapy and refuses to talk with them. Still trying to convince him for weekly therapies. How should we talk to him about his diagnosis and convince him for therapy…?

- He was placed into the special education program in the same public school after he released from hospital and following institution. Should we continue with public school or search for alternative school options? Academically he is good and takes AP Math class.

- We want him to have some interests. Sports / arts etc. To support his social skills. He prefers to spend long time on his computer games. We can’t convince him to go out.

Not: Apologies for the long message and language mistakes.",1

"College professor nearly kicked me from college for ""cheating"". Turns out I didn't actually ""cheat"", but everyone still thinks I'm stupid/lazy as hell A year ago, I enrolled in art history as a minor. Till then, I was never any form of ""science"" person; I always specialised in literature and essays. Due to this, my first ""science paper""...tbf...felt really strange to me. Scary even. We also didn't get a special ""introduction"" class, like in my major. Instead, we just got a rough paper and a generic  ""...and remember to cite your sources!""

My first topic was pretty heavy: The Christian St. Nicholas. If you know the guy, you'd know that he not only has little paintings of him (ORIGINAL middle age depictions -not 'Santa Clause' legends), but even less information on any of them. If you're lucky, you'll find a random ass Italian text and websites that don't cite their pictures. Which, in this case, happened to me: Exactly one (1!) text which talked about the painting...and which was in fluid Italian.

To cut things short: I screwed up. The entire thing. There's not one thing I did right, basically. From the thesis, to the structure, to the cover letter...everything. And tbf; I am not that surprised. I can analyse the shit out of certain things, but writing a formal, completely objective, observational, paper...? I would have probably needed excercises beforehand per se. Just to give me a ""feeling"" for the style & differences. Aka: It's unfortunate, but next time, I will actively seek out someone I can check up with. Easy, peasy...*right?*

...well...not really.

You see: While fucking up, I kinda hit the queen kicker.  Because a science text felt so ""other"" to me, I thought that it also needed special treatement. After translating the Italian text with Deepl (tip: don't. It might still translate things wrong.), I was confused in how I should quote it/use foreign sources. As I had no trusty ""MLA handbook"", I went around to ask people and went to -oh irony - courses against accidental plagarism. I think, in hindsight people thought that it was just a sentence or something I needed to translate. ""Just write vgl."" (vgl.=compared to), or ""Just say 'summarised from'."" The answers were very simple, which ironically made sense to me: Science is about facts. If a painting is in a wooden frame that's a fact, not an interpretation. And you don't need to quote facts, do you? *(In hindsight, yes, I know how stupid that sounds, but I was trapped in bureaucracy and semantics)*

Anyway. Half a year passed. I get a mail from my prof, telling me I failed his course. Including the fairly angry rant that I not only cited wrong, but he could kick me from college for ""translation plagarism"" -only reason he didn't do so, were 1.) I was ""only"" a 2nd semester and 2.) he was one of the people I bothered with my problem. So most likely wasn't supposed to be sneaky cheaty, just incompetent. After that I realized I needed some help. Like, personal help. Aka someone I could work WITH, not just unpersonal theoretical stuff I misinterpret. However, as expected, I mostly gained mockery. Because it was so ""obvious"" to everyone else. People instead constantly think that I was just ""too lazy"" to find the right source. 

Honestly. I'm not even surprised at that reaction anymore: Something blowing up through a miscommunication. People screaming at me and seeing me as a bad person. Then when I'm not, it's still my fault and I'm just ""too stupid/lazy/why didn't you...?"" Guess it's the ASD experience.",1
"Running out of road.... fed up ASD, fed up life   

*Warning, misery dump incoming.* 

I am completely fed up of life and really feeling like I'm running out of road right now tbh...

I’m mid-30s…. no relationship or even dating, that is precluded by being cursed with this horrible Aspergers condition (yes, it is a curse – the ‘autism is my superpower’ lobby can go screw themselves). If I was super-good looking I could perhaps make up for it but I am a 6 at best, so basically all round poor-quality genetic material. To make matters worse my sexuality is messed up (mostly straight but around 30% gay), though in my case it is almost certainly down to having a super distant relationship with my father (thanks autism gene!) as I don’t find most guys attractive (I find guys much easier to read than gals, so most of my experience is with guys). So if I ever did get in relationship that would prove a major stumbling block. Social life – same thing, a string of failures, missed opportunities, awkward encounters. 

My ‘career’ is a dumpster fire – just a string of short-term, low-status jobs etc. I have a decent job atm though the pay is not great. I have been building a freelance business on the side though I don’t earn anywhere near enough to do f/t, so the extra money is basically just covering the rising cost of living, so I am in effect running just to stand still. My job is right in the firing line for the AI revolution and I have little to no other marketable skills, and believe you me I have pushed my limited intelligence to its limits. The thought of being unemployed again just terrifies me – honestly I would rather die than deal with that humiliation again.

Despite saving saving saving I still cannot afford a house or even a flat, so I am stuck in the living hell of renting i.e. handing over a huge amount of my wealth each month to some scumbag landlord for some crappy tiny flat. I’ve rented about 6 places in the past 10 years and EVERY one of them had at least one serious issue with it (mice, damp, noise etc.) Currently I am in the middle of a formal dispute with my previous landlord due to a tissue of lies and unsafe practices at my last place, though it looks like they’ll get away with compensating me maybe £100-200 – chump change for them so basically they’ve gotten away with it. The property system is completely rigged and the thought of living like this for the rest of my life just terrifies me. And if I do buy somewhere than what? – it’ll be some cheapo rubbishy flat at best in a dodgy area – me being a slave paying it off for 40 years. I won’t even be able to have dog in such a garden-less tiny space, which is the one thing I would like (kids are out of the picture obviously).

I attempted to ramp up the saving by swallowing my pride and moving back in with parents rent-free (at their suggestion I might add). I lasted 2 months. They are utterly toxic. Their marriage is near collapse. My father is a selfish, childish, OCD narc, almost certainly Aspergers too – he deliberately picked a woman (my mom) with very low self esteem to marry as he knew no one else would put up with his crap. I won’t go on, but dealing with his endless anger outbursts/sulking ruined my childhood (enabled by mom who constantly made excuses for him), then he just ignored me in adolescence – no advice or guidance AT ALL. Nothing. Living there dredged all the old resentments back up and completely wore me out and so I had to get out as I was approaching mental breakdown territory.

Society/politics – my country (UK) is in serious decline. Each year things get worse. All the institutions are failing. Politics is an utter waste of time – all parties are just utterly corrupt and self-serving. The country won’t collapse Somalia-style, but it is rapidly turning into a Latin American banana republic – stagnant economy, hollowed-out middle class, dysfunctional institutions, corrupt politics. There is no future here and I don’t have the skills to emigrate somewhere better. My fraying faith in the society itself (as opposed to the political class) was finally destroyed in the Covid period. I could see it was all a load of nonsense pretty much from the beginning, and seeing the vast majority of people just obeying nonsensical and inhuman orders because ‘The Science’ says so, whist viciously scapegoating and hating anyone who raised so much as scintilla of scepticism, has just shredded what little faith I had left in humanity tbh. 

As for the bigger picture… I have searched for ‘God’ for 19 years now. Studied all the major religions and most of the smaller ones too. Psychedelics, meditation, prayer, sacred texts, counselling etc – I’ve tried it all and nothing has worked or filled that God-shaped hole in my heart. Reluctantly I have concluded that’s there’s nothing to it and ended up a de facto atheist which frankly depresses me no end. All my old hobbies (films, reading, travelling, going out drinking) just completely bore me now and I get nothing from them anymore. I am constantly angry, constantly tired, I have no hope for the future, either for myself or the wider planet. I am sick of being shafted by scumbags for money which is all anyone care about on this fetid cesspit of a planet. I don’t even have the salve of friendships and family as this horrible brain deformity makes it impossible to establish relationships. I am just completely DONE and I’m not even sure I’ll make it 2024. I am running out of road pretty fast.",1

1)  I'm 18 so it would require me to talk to my parents first because I personally don't have money for the diagnosis. I've been trying to bring this up with my mum but I always get too anxious to even start. It's so stressful even thinking about telling her that I suspect having autism.  
2) The idea of talking to a stranger about my life is another extremely stressful thing which prevents me from getting diagnosed.  
3) I have looked up places where I could get diagnosed that are not 200km away and the diagnosis there is literally just 1 meeting, either a 3 hour interview or 2 hour ados2 test. This makes me feel like it's not going to be reliable and that even if I were to get diagnosed it would still make me think that it might be false.  
4) I'm not sure if it would benefit me tbh, I kinda feel that this ""self-diagnosis"" made me understand myself better and I don't harm anyone with it cause I don't even bring it up. But on the other hand I would like to get diagnosed to explain my behaviour to my family without sounding like an idiot, or if it turns out that I don't have autism I would atleast know what's up for real.

So what should I do? Is it worth going through all this stress?",1
"Mask falling off? I have two selves. Myself and my masked self. I have a pretty easy time masking *when meeting new people* and acting all fun and sociable. A lot of people like my masked self, and I often quickly make friends when presenting like this. 

However after I've established a connection with the person, my mask subconsciously falls away and I retreat into my *actual self* - robotic voice, low energy, shy and awkward. Not the fun, nice, sociable self I initially presented myself to them as. Problem no. 2 is that I can't seem to go *back* to the masked self after dropping it, as it's incredibly exhausting ... and they've already seen my real, unlikeable, self now so what's the purpose?

This issue has directly resulted in people becoming disinterested in me pretty fast after I ""retreat"" into my awkward little self. It makes me incredibly sad that I can't seem to hold on to people.

Why is this? Is there a way to ""retain"" the mask?

I should probably note that I was diagnosed 1.5 yr ago and haven't really talked with my psych a lot so I don't know a whole lot about autism or its effects.",1

"Do people with aspergers panic less in stressful situations? Somehow I never get into panic crisis mode. At the moment something happens I'm just very aware of everything around me.

Like I was biking and a car hit me from the right (they had to stop). I got hit and I did not brace myself (some weird thought that bracing will cause more harm), hit the windshield and slowly fell of the hood to the ground. I just laid still on the road and slowly tested al my muscles and limbs for injuries before standing up. I was okay, the bike not :(

Other stressful events have happend and I always stay aware of the situation. I never panic in such situations.

What I was wondering if this is a thing that's aspergers related, a generally normal reaction or just my thing. I often see people getting emotional out of control at such critical moments. I just stop (even if it's for a split second) and analyse first before doing anything.

Edit: Thanks for the answers. And I do hope you can find a way to transform or get rid of the sources that gives some of you anxiety.",1
"I feel like NTs underestimate how shitty you get treated in life for things you can't help. Especially since most of them for some reason believe we live in a just world and anything bad is probably your fault. Us higher functioning aspies get treated like shit cause we look like NTs on the outside but don't act like it so they just write us off as stupid, weird, lazy, dangerous, whatever. And don't even get me started on stuff like height, being born into a poor family, having a physical deformity, having any sexual problems (this one especially if you're a man), being physically disabled, being homeless (I know some people can be homeless due to addiction issues but there's a also a lot of people who are homeless who were are veterans), etc. The world is colder than what people wanna admit and I'm just sick of people trying to convince us it's this way because we some how deserve it.",1
"Shower Thought: Trying to Get a Girlfriend is Exactly Like Trying to Find a Job I feel like I should issue this disclaimer up front: I am not owed a date/a girlfriend/sex, woman are not involved in some nebulous conspiracy to fuck Chad's, or any other incel bullshit. I can't say I'm happy about woman turning me down repeatably and I will admit there are times when they could be nicer about it but they made their choice and I have to respect that.

All I'm doing is expressing/venting about what the dating life is like for me on the spectrum.

With that out of the way: getting a girlfriend on the spectrum (and it wouldn't surprise me if it's like this for most NTS) is exactly like looking for a job; you can send ""resume"" after ""resume"" but 99% of the time you get passed over without a second thought. Woman tend to be pickier about their partners then men (and with good reason) so they usually have a lot more choice. Same thing with work; as they usually have more applicants than jobs.

Connections are everything which works against me in both instances.

The few that are willing to give me a chance usually either drop me for shallow reasons, treat me like shit, or are running some kind of a scam. I'll admit there were more than a few times where I kinda deserved it though although there are plenty of times when I didn't do anything wrong.",1
"New to this Hi,

Recently, my psychiatrist said I might be on the spectrum. He said I should go for a diagnosis, which takes years in the U.K. It's bit been a bit of a hard base diagnosis, I've always felt different socially and generally how I process my emotions. I work in software, so they haven't been so supportive, they say everyone is a bit, but in a way, I feel they don't understand.

"My Best Friend of 15+ Years Has ASD - Need Advice I’m making this post because frankly it hasn’t always been easy to get along with my best friend. I love him like a brother and we have the most transparent relationship I’ve ever experienced which I’m grateful for. 

There are some, mostly very small, challenges that come up with him regularly but those “small challenges” can pile up sometimes, especially when we’re together, and leave me in a place of shock and a desire to understand. I’ve done very minimal research on ASD admittedly because I know how hard it was for him as a teenager to become diagnosed. He was (and still is) incredibly resentful of his parents and he believed the diagnosis was for them more than himself. He is so resentful that he has nearly completely ridden his immediate family off out of his life. I did not want him to feel judged by me so I kept myself in the dark of what ASD really was even though I was more aware of the signs moving forward. 

As a teenager, when we met, he was a goofy kid in school. He wasn’t really invested into school even though he is very intelligent. And he ended up dropping out of high school after trying 3 different schools. He did end up getting his GED later and went on to try different majors in college at 3 different universities before ultimately dropping out. When he did get into college he invested everything he had into his studies and had incredible grades. I could tell this was very validating to him but it came at such a high cost for him. He didn’t take care of himself at this time. He barely ate, showered, or had any social life. He would take so many classes at once to try and speed up the process and often verbalized he was capable of succeeding this way more than giving himself less of a load. He had all the time he needed grant you, his education was completely covered by him using his once hated diagnosis of ASD as a means to obtain diversity scholarships. I watched him 3 times in university completely burn himself out by putting too much on his plate. He always had an excuse ready though. With engineering it was “I have a math deficiency.” With environmental science, which he was one semester from completing, it was “I don’t see where this career path leads to success.” Etc. 

After he dropped out he tried odd jobs like delivery driving and basically just became a recluse. I ended up getting him a job with a friend of mine at a vape distribution company. He dove right in and within a year moved all the way up the ladder where he was the right hand guy to the CEO. All the while he would call me nearly every day to tell me quite literally EVERY detail of his work day. That went on for years and still continues on his current career of truck driving. 

His life as a trucker I think suits him very well. He’s really good at it and makes good money. Unfortunately I think it also does cater to him holding on to some of his worse traits of not taking care of himself which I’m worried will catch up to him eventually. Example being he almost exclusively eats fast food because he’s so fixated on managing his job responsibilities that he doesn’t plan for very much else. 

Every once and awhile if he’s close by where I live we try and coordinate for him to stay with me. I know this is mostly a time for him to relax and try to unwind from the work life, so I try and make things comfortable for him. He can’t let the work go though and basically only talks about that unless I really take charge and have us do stuff. He has also never been very organized with things/belongings, and it a total slob when he comes over and leaves his room and wherever he hangs out, which is normally the kitchen table on his laptop, a wreck. And he likes to poke fun at how neat I keep my place, calling me “domesticated” or make fun of something I have, saying it’s over the top, like a frosted mug for a beer he wanted. 

I know this is a really long and personal post, and obviously I can’t fit it all on here, but any advice or resources someone can provide on how to better understand adults with ASD would be much appreciated. I hope this hasn’t read like a rant, I’m just trying to paint a little picture to show what kind of person we both are. I do care a lot for my friend, and I hope some day we can break through this “unspeakable” diagnosis he has and be able to talk clearly about his ASD so I can better understand how to be there for him and tell him my needs too. Thanks!",1
"Spring is coming: Looking for tips for light sensitivity in the morning The month is March and in the Northern Hemisphere that means sunlight is creeping into our rooms earlier and earlier.

I am not sensitive to light to the point that I have to wear sunglasses outside, but enough that it wakes me up in the morning, sometimes way earlier than when my alarm rings.

I lived in Sweden for some time (where it's sufficiently high up north that in summer there's practically no night time, a nightmare) so I've already tackled this issue in the past with moderate success:

- Blackout curtains are great, I love them, I would never dream of sleeping without them. The problem is that in my current bedroom the windows are slightly arched, so the curtains don't cover them entirely and there's still enough light coming in to illuminate the whole room.
- Cardboard on windows was very efficient, but from the outside it makes you look like a lunatic, if you have a lot of neighbors facing your window. I also struggle with routines so I'd 100% leave them up at all times, and I don't want my neighbors to start asking questions.
- I've tried sleeping with a sleeping mask, but somehow by morning I'm not wearing it anymore. I think I take it off in my sleep? While traveling I've also used my tube scarf (the interior is a kind of plush material and the smell is comforting) but in summer when it gets hot that's not really an option.

"Successful social strategies? I've been trying now for years and I can't seem to figure out a good way to interact with NT's that is respectful in my eyes. I'm seen as combative, argumentative, and negative more often than not when trying to engage in their ideas and conversations - to the point that I actually can't figure out how to ask a question correctly with out negative social repercussions. The only successful strategy I've found is to treat them like emotionally unstable children - where you coddle and manipulate them with soothing voices, positivity, and a focus on their immediate ego driven whims. 

The smile and nodding thing while casually echoing the last half of their phrases seems to work really well - but I cant find a way to engage in their ideas with out grievously offending them in some way. Just coddling them works well enough but at that rate why bother having the interaction in the first place if its all just a song and dance so they don't throw a temper tantrum? Like I get that my brain might not work quite right for what ever reason, but it just feels like I'm surrounded by spoiled children all the time :(

Then when I just let them do their thing because obviously, they don't want me there, some of them will give me an attitude for not contributing.

"Is this autistic burnout? I picked up my gf after work to go get groceries as we agreed upon. When she gets in the car she asks ""can we also stop off at my parents to give a bday gift to my dad?""

For some reason that really stressed me out. A last minute social engagement, my nightmare. I started driving to her parents place. Along the way ""oh but we have to get a gift."" Ok, another change, I would have taken a different route had I known she didn't have a gift yet.

Then ""actually let's do the grocery shop first then the gift."" Help me, I feel like I'm dying inside. ""Ok"" I say.

We get groceries, she gets a gift, we go to her parents. The whole time my insides feel like they are recoiling, trying to escape this mortal realm to dive into the abyss. We spend like 2 hours chatting to her brother, mom, dad, other brother. It's pleasant enough, they are nice people, but I'm already feeling so stressed and exhausted I'm having a hard time keeping my mask on and smiling, but I do.

We head out and go home where I go lie down on the bed in the dark for another 2 hours. It's been hours since then but I still feel so exhausted. I feel irritated, noises are making my head hurt but I don't have a headache, my body has no energy, moving feels like I'm walking through molasses.

"Elon Musk is making us all look bad, and I'm worried that NT people will think we're all like him This is going to be a bit of a rant, but I would like some other people's opinion on this.

Elon Musk has been seriously pissing me off ever since he bought Twitter. Just recently he was harassing a now former Twitter employee for being disabled. Musk has since apologized but I feel like he only did so because somebody from his pr told him to. I get that it's very common for us Aspies to do things that are rude but normally when we do so it's for something small, not something like this.

Elon has also been pushing far right conspiracy theories like the myth about the world population going down rather than up, which is why he has so many kids. I've heard some people saying that he doesn't really spend that much time with his kids, but I can't really confirm that except for the case of his trans daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson. He's even COVID a ""specific form of the common cold.""

He doesn't spend anymore time with Jenna and he blames communism for it. He says that he supports trans people but calls pronouns an esthetic nightmare. If he actually did support trans people than he would spend more time with Jenna.

Musk has also reinstated the accounts of multiple right-wing extremists like Marjorie Green, Andrew Tate and the Babylon Bee. He also replies to accounts like Libs of TikTok, an account that's well known for getting people doxxed, and he promises that Twitter will be a better place (for them).

I've also read that he's one of the worst people to work for (most rich people like him usually are). During a production problem a Tesla he told his employees that they weren't smart enough to be working on the problem. I've also heard that employees will avoid walking past his office or where ever he's, especially when he's having a bad day, in order to avoid being yelled at or possibly fired on a whim.

"Frustrated after doctor’s visit Hello everyone. I am writing here hoping to get some feedback about next steps for my son (10 yrs old). Today we finally had my son’s Autism evaluation that we have been waiting for six months to get. The appointment left me frustrated and at a loss of what to do next. The doctor that we met with is a very prominent one, (he is nationally recognized), so I was excited to be able to see him to get some help. However, the appointment went in a completely different direction. The doctor constantly talked over me and seemed dismissive of any concerns that I had. He asked me if I watched Young Sheldon, and I said yes. He said “that’s your son,” but basically it didn’t matter that he had autism. His anxiety was the only issue that needed to be addressed, and to get therapy for three months, and if that didn’t work, to put him on Prozac. I know that medication works wonders for some people, but I am not putting my 10 year old child on Prozac. I came to get help to learn how to best interact with my son and support him in his autism. I wanted tips on how to help his food aversion, his struggles with texture, him trying to argue his points without seeing other people’s views, etc., but the answer for him was just therapy and try Prozac. He even said that he thought that he had ADHD (even though he focuses just fine in school and at home), but that having autism was not a reason for any of his struggles. So I guess my question is, do I get a second opinion from someone else about a treatment path for my child?",1

I literally don’t know how to get by in life, throughout most of it I’d just get approached by someone and then he’d be my support and we get through things together then never talk again.

"Feeling misdiagnosed Ever since I got diagnosed a few months back I have been so confused about myself I feel like none of the criteria fit me really and I don’t relate to autistic experiences
But after my tests my doctor and psychologist insist that I am on the spectrum
Why?
The reason they gave me was that I repeat a lot of stuff have weird speech patterns lack eyecontact and ask odd questions.
Well that’s what they gave me from my behavior at least
I had tests done where they tested a lot of my skills they were ruling out intellectual disability and came to the conclusion I have autism because of my spiky profile and social behavior.

I don’t have sensory issues or specific interests really. I have social problems but that was due to me growing up isolated with my autistic mother

Still it bothers me because I have work where I have to be very social and since autism causes social issues I am now really scared of how other percieve me. I never thought of myself as different.

I still don’t understand my social struggles, as a child I played with other kids fine and apparently autistic kids struggle with imaginative play which I did not. I also have no need for routines… also I had speech therapy as a child and they didn’t suspect anything being off

"""Normal"" I know this topic was brought here millions of times, but I do it again.

People say to me ""why don't you just act normal?"", specially girls, and I only have one way to act. One way I found that it's mostly acceptable in some circles. I'm the ""crazy"" one, if I don't use my ""quirky"" traits to make some kind of show to them, I end up being the laughing stock. People still make fun of the ""crazy"" one, but is less painful than being the laughing stock, and it's more fun and more authentic. It makes me feel like I have a little control over that, feels safer. And that's all I can do on ""acting"", rather than isolate myself.

I don't know what ""normal"" even is, I think people say that I have to be normal just to make fun of me or manipulate me... Or maybe try it to see how I react and measure my worth based on it, and I don't want to be a surprise test subject, I don't want to be more anxious than I already am about social interactions and pleasing everybody acting a different personality to each individual. I can't maintain an image of being another way than the one I practiced, so, being what they call ""normal"" isn't inside my possibilities. I used to answer ""NO, I CAN'T AND I DON'T WANT TO ACT NORMAL, leave that to the ""normies"" and their social problems"". 

I think being normal is being authentic, but in society seems like ""normal"" is some kind of general thing that everyone knows what it is, and assume everyone should act that way, and a the same time, they reject it, they say ""being normal is boring"", ""normal people are boring""... But when they see a REAL person that is not normal, they jump to ""CaN't YoU JuSt Be NoRmAL?!"". They say they don't like ""normal"" just to gain some kind of social tittle they don't naturally have ... Like if being autistic was some kind of privilege.

2. She said something like ""oh you don't want to hang out with me? you just want to be alone on your phone?"" which sounded to me like she was being passive-aggressive (but maybe i misinterpreted)
3. I immediately put my phone down and said ""i'm not allowed to be on my phone? you're making me feel guilty for being on my phone""
4. She took my response to be passive-aggressive (again, i was overstimulated and didn't quite have much awareness of tone and affect but i was pretty sure her tone was aggressive and mine was apologetic, passive but direct). Then she got angry and started yelling at me
5. I felt threatened and became more regressed and eventually went into shutdown when she was yelling at me.

1. how to predict when this is going to happen, 
2. how to manage situations like this in the moment
3. how do you defend yourself when you feel like someone is telling you your tone was combative but you're pretty sure it wasn't (situations like this are where i think autistics like me are very susceptible to being gaslit)",1
"Should I seek a second opinion? [F][20] Hi! Recently I got tested for Autism but instead I was diagnosed with the following:
•Bipolar type II
•ADHD
•Generalized anxiety (Social anxiety) 
•Sensory processing disorder 

Should I get a second opinion? They used ADOS to test me. My test results said I did make some eye content, did hand gestures , was friendly so basically I’m too emotive to have autism . But they don’t realize I was masking the entire time and have learned to mask. Seeking advice🥺. I’m feeling lost.",1
"I'm not lonely but I really am I often feel like I can thrive when I'm alone and don't even consider the idea of other people. Emphasis on the last part - it's getting more and more complicated to do that. Like, actually impossible without alcohol or drugs. So, once I stick my head out of my metaphorical cave, it's like I'm assaulted, sucked into social ""games"" I'm not even really interested in playing and where I'm the obvious loser anyway. Like the idea of other people being here, judging me and expecting things of me based on my look / age / expected role makes me automatically a participant in a play I never wanted to be in. 

DAE, what do you think, is this an autism thing, an anxiety thing or a didn't-have-meaningful-relationships-for-a-long-time thing, a need relationships too much thing, a repressed emotions thing, what is this, input would be appreciated even if it's just an opinion.",1
Do people ever stopped talking/liking you because you are autistic? I realized I'm losing some friends. I haven't said anything neither did anything wrong. It seems that it's because I am autistic. I don't understand why they would stop talking to me and treating me well just because I was born like this. This upsets me a lot. Have you ever been through this?,1
"Why cant I seem to do anything when things are good? Yet I'm super productive when things are bad? I am stuck in this mess currently, and I don't know what to do. When things are bad, I am stimulated, with a clear mind and am able to function well. When things are good, my mind goes blank and I don't have the motivation or clarity in my mind to do anything, I always end up in a pit of executive dysfunction. I've tried meditating and Adderall, yet none seem to work. I am completely lost and don't know what to do.







 I can never have a clear mind, I've tried adderall, meditation and nothing works that well, Except when things go wrong. Like I can have pure concentration and feel normal when something goes wrong, like when I got fired from my job and was miserable. I was motivated and was able to live a somewhat normal life. Now currently when I wake up, my brain doesn't work. I am not motivated and completely blank of thoughts. I don't know what I am doing and I am always stuck in confusion and executive dysfunction. I feel that i am punished for being happy. I dont know how to move forward. No matter when I get motivation, I always revert back in a few days. I feel that I am punished for being happy. What can be done to help?  


 I have always grown up in rough situation's and I always had the motivation",1
"Oh God, where to begin with this So guys,

reading the comments made by those diagnosed with autism/asperger spectrum disorder, particularly  a comment where a user described it as ""being like in a movie or a play where you're coerced to do the role to the best of Your abilities while not knowing the script"" hit me hard or that people with asperger's have unusually strong interest in a certain field. For example, mine was aviation, and by the age of 12, I was easily able to tell certain aircraft apart by just looking at details which majority of the general public would find miniscule (such as shape of the aicraft nose, the length, the engines etc.) Also, not to mention the other stuff such as being relatively introverted and the fact I had a dificult time socializing as a kid. At 23, I have reasonable doubts that I might be on a slight autistic spectrum. So, for those who have been diagnosed with it, how long does it take for an adult to be diagnosed by a psychiatrists?

Also, a question for girls; is it true that women are normally able to hide their autistic traits considerably better than guys by simply learning how to imitate other ""normal"" girls?

&#x200B;

God bless You,

&#x200B;

have a wonderful day.",1
"[Rant] Kinda bummed that I'll probably never be able to have a job I've been on temporary disability pension because of Asperger's since I was 20. Never worked in my life, I was stressing out about my first year of school that I couldn't finish. I didn't know how I was going to get income when I drop out since in my country you are entitled to financial aid while you're a student if you have a condition that makes your functioning limited.

My mom suggested disability pension since she knows a lot about these things because of her work. I had no idea such thing even existed but when I read about it I thought ""Hey, this sounds like something I could qualify for!"". So I got fixated on the idea that I -will- get a pension and I'll -never- have to worry about money again.

Fast forward an unknown time and here I am twiddling my thumbs at age 23, a year left of my pension. I will probably quality for it once again, but man do I have dreams. 

I wish to be a pharmacist or an entrepeneur. My doctor asked me where I see myself in the future, and I told her that I wanted to start studying pharmacology and start working at a pharmacy. She shut me down and asked if I have ""realistic dreams"". She might be right, I have too much issues with stress and sensory overload. I don't think I'd actually be able to study full time.

Or did she gaslight me? I don't know, but man I wish I had a skill or a profession. Everytime I try to learn something new I get overstimulated with information and eventually shut down.

I want to be so many things. A screenwriter, an author, a 3D artist... but my human condition is being limited by Asperer's. I kind of hate it.

I guess I just gotta sit down and enjoy my pension and special interests, while I can.",1
"Believing in yourself when there's nothing to believe in and everyone around you seems to lie to make you feel better? The title basically. I'm so tired of trying to find the answer to this. It's been killing me for months. I just don't understand it. How does one believe in themselves when they can't do anything right? When they only make everyone around them upset and say the wrong things and make the wrong decisions and fail and fall and fail and FAIL? How?! I don't get it. I mean, what is there about me that could be construed as positive or good and worth being happy about it being apart of me? That I'm a kind person? Hell no, that's only lead to me being taken advantage of and having my feelings disregarded. That I have good work ethic? What does that matter when I can't even get a job I can handle? It's just so painful knowing I'm this... Pathetically worthless while the few people I consider my friends have been able to move on with their lives, slowly growing more and more distant as they leave me in the dust. It feels like if I don't put everyone before myself then they'll leave me, and you know what, they probably will. And I probably deserved it for not being good enough, for being unable to adapt and push through the challenges of entering the real world. Honestly, the only thing I deserve is to be put down like a dog so I stop dragging everyone around me down with my attitude, my inability, my lack of value, all of it.

I know I should be able to get past these thoughts and the myriad other negative thoughts, but I can't and don't know what to do anymore. I'm so close to giving up, to just accepting that I'll always be alone, anyways be disgusting and fat, always be in pain, always a disappointment. If I were just a little bit braver maybe I'd even man up and remove myself from the equation of life and lessen the burden I inflict on everyone around me. But I'm not, I'm just a pathetic, scared, crying little boy in a man's body. The only way I can see it is I deserve this pain.",1
"I hate it when someone tells me to date someone else with aspergers or to try an autism dating site. Just because someone has autism doesn't mean that I would have anything in common with them, that doesn't address that everyone with autism is different and aspergers is different than other types, less than 1% of woman have aspergers so that would really limit me, and many of the people on those sites are in a different country that I'm not interested in going to just to meet someone.",1
"Afraid of diagnosis. All my life i have felt so alienated from my peers. I never truly fit in if i was being my genuine self. Only when I started observing my peers mannerisms and trying my best to mimic them, was I truly accepted. I always knew autism was a thing, but the thought of me having it never crossed my mind (mostly due to the inaccurate representations of autism in tv shows and etc). It was only recently that I started to research some of the symptoms commonly associated with autism and almost every symptom was relatable in one way or another. For the first time in my life I finally felt as if i had a complete understanding of myself. I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety, but I always felt as if something was missing and those diagnoses were just a few pieces of the puzzle i have yet to solve. I am convinced i am autistic and i hope i am, as it would answer so many questions i have about myself. I feel as if i would be diagnosed with autism if given an evaluation, yet I’m afraid to do so because if i was not diagnosed with autism, then I really don’t know what or who i am, what community can best support me, how to give an explanation to past experiences, etc. 

I feel like I’m experiencing imposter syndrome.

Anyone have any feedback or is in a similar situation?",1

Just the way he completely throws social expectations to the wind and is not afraid to be a creep, pushing first amendment protections to the brim.  Yes, he crossed a line.  

I also am gonna be honest and say that the way he spouts the nonsense loudly and pompously is hilarious, combined with how ridiculous the statements are.",1
"I made a horrible dating rookie mistake and now I question my own morality Let it be clear from the start: I have a weak theory of mind and I always considered myself a good person (I donated blood 15 times and plasma 13 times, and I worked as a volunteer four times in my life), but I'm still deeply ashamed for what I did.

I had my sixth date with a woman who reciprocated my feelings since last November (we were knowing each other so that we wouldn't have made rushful decisions, not to mention she also had high expectations on me) and she was aware of that fact I was autistic. Under the assumption that it could have been an indirect compliment, I told her that her sister (whom she showed to me a few days earlier) was an attractive girl, but not as much as her. She also asked me if I wanted to meet her, and I naively said yes (as a friend). These two reactions made her feel cheated and she told me I don't deserve her  and that I dared to tell her that her sister was better than her. I tried to explain that I didn't mean to offend her but, alas, she didn't just listen. I also told her that I felt manipulated, because I don't like trick questions that may be interpreted the wrong way (I tend to give straight answers because of my condition). Now we broke up and I started questioning my own morality, considering I promised myself to never treat the others as my bullies did in the past. To add insult to injury, I found out only a few minutes later on Reddit and Quora that what I did was a big no no. Well, better late then never. Now I can at least avoid repeating the same mistake in the future with an unpleasant memory I will never forget.",1
"Asking about Asperger’s My father is diagnosed with Asperger’s, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder mid of last year.

All of my life I had struggled with social interaction, inability to understand people’s way of thinking/thought processing or emotions. I was always behind in school, no matter how hard I tried.

My mother recently told me how in Pre-School and through the years when I was young that I was obsessed with stairs. Pre-School was 2 hours, and the entire time everyday of Pre-School I would climb up and down the stairs. My mom then went on to talk about how they did everything to get me to do other activities, and to engage more with the others kids. But that never stopped me from climbing the stairs because I was distracted and obsessed with them. 

Then my mother talked to me about how she bought the tall 4 shelved bookshelf’s that were those big plastic ones typically used in garages. She had bought four of them, putting them in the dining area where I would put all of my collections obsessively on. But those cool were constantly changing.

When I hit elementary school, I had a very hard time making friends because I wouldn’t understand why they had such disinterest in me. I was loud, talked very loudly, but I never saw anything wrong and why they thought it was wrong because that was just how I talked. When adults and teachers would yell at me to be quieter, I was always hurt personally by those comment because it was just me.

Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was constantly told to smile and look happy. Which I also didn’t understand because I thought my facial expressions were fine. Then I come to find out that everyone was saying I have a resting bitch face. Which I also found out intimidated people, which was obviously never on my agenda. I still get these comments quite often. 

Starting towards the end of elementary school and all the way through my freshman year of college, I pick up interests in sports, academic clubs or councils, and other activities but then I would shortly loose interest in them. It’s an endless cycle.

I’ve learned a lot about how undiagnosed and unrecognized Autism throughout your youth can start that development of Bipolar Disorder. 

My mom the other day in the car had told me that she believes I have Autism, and that she missed all the signs when I was growing up because we moved a lot, and that she wished she would’ve recognized them sooner to get me tested. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about it, and with my knowledge of my father having Asperger’s, and my mom coming to me about her thinking I have Autism. And I’ve been thinking about bringing this all up to my provider because its expensive to test for a diagnosis, and I don’t have the money to be able to do that. 

I have no idea how to approach this further, or to even wrap my head around everything. I was wondering if there’s any more advice on how to go further with this.",1
"How many friends did you guys have in elementary school? I’m honestly curious, since I remember always having one “best” friend or someone I was more attached to than anyone else. I also remember getting annoyed when other people would try to join us and wasn’t welcoming of meeting new comers in general. 

I do recall trying to join groups during their pretend play only to be kicked out usually. My mom told me that I left the “popular” group in kindergarten because they wouldn’t let me be who I wanted to be during pretend play. It wasn’t that I couldn’t pretend play, but was rather uncooperative. My first grade teacher told my mom, I would be one of those people with a few close friends but not a lot of friends. I wonder what aspect of me made her say that.

"I have a lot of problems that are constantly bothering me I’ve been having a really tough time lately. There are a lot of things bothering me that instantly make me depressed once I think about them.  


* I’ve been out of college for over a year and I still don’t have a full-time job. I’ve tried so hard to find one for my degrees (communication and film), yet I was only able to land a part-time job as a baker in a cookie store. The only full-time opportunities I got were for sales jobs. All the jobs related to my degrees also require years of experience I don’t have.
* At the same time, I’m scared of what having a full-time job will do to me. I don’t like the idea of having to wake up early each day (for the record, I usually wake up around 9 or ten) and then work for eight hours only to go home and have little time to do the stuff I want to do. I also hate the idea of having little free time to do things like going to game stores for Warhammer and d&d.
* There’s so much stuff I want to do, yet I don’t have the will to do them. There are games I want to play, books I want to read, stuff I want to watch, models I want to write, and stuff I want to write. Yet I rarely get around to any of them and more often than not just waste my time browsing YouTube or Reddit. I can’t seem to make myself do any of those things despite wanting to do them. And then my list of things I want to do grows larger without me making any progress on getting through it.
   * On top of that, I feel like I’m extremely lazy. I feel like I put off stuff I need to do constantly, either because I get distracted with other stuff or because I don’t have the will to make myself do them. For example, I wanted to make this post for a while and only now have I finally found the will to do it.
      * I am diagnosed with ADHD and I heard a lot of people with it suffer from executive dysfunction, but I don’t know if I have that or if I am just lazy.
* I want to write, but I also don’t want to write at the same time. I preferably want to write fiction and while there are plenty of ideas I want to write about, there are some that I feel uncomfortable writing about for some reason. I don’t know if it’s because they’re too personal, if I’m afraid of being judged for them, or if I’m scared people would look at me differently because of them. But whatever the reason is, I don’t want to write about them despite writing being what I want to do.
* I feel like I pursued the wrong career in college. I originally wanted to pursue either engineering or filmmaking, but after having a terrible time in an engineering class, I decided I’d rather go into filmmaking and become a writer. However, with how hard it’s been finding a job and the problem I just mentioned, I feel like I made the wrong choice.
* I have few friends and don’t know how to make more. I moved down to Florida from New England last year and it still feels like I haven't made a lot of progress. I’ve tried going to game stores and joining a board game club in the community I’m in, but it doesn’t feel like I’ve made any big friendships. I try to keep in contact with my friends from back home, but they never text me and if I try texting them they won’t always respond to me. As you can probably imagine, it doesn’t feel good.

These thoughts have been bothering me for over a month now and they feel like a reminder of how awful of a person I am. It’s gotten to the point where I want to beat myself whenever I think about them because I feel like I deserve it. I want to find some way to resolve these problems, but I don’t know what to do.",1
"I stood up for myself for the first time today and failed For a long time, I’ve been made fun of by people because of what I wear. Usually it doesn’t bother me for long but it would be wrong to say that it doesn’t make me feel bad about myself or that it doesn’t make me insecure. People insult and make fun of me to my face, they touch me and make passive aggressive comments. Every time that I thought to start dressing more “normally” I always told myself, don’t be afraid to be who you are because who cares about what other people think.

Well today, I caved in and for the first time in 2 years I came to school looking “normal”. I got sick of all the touching and rude comments but I felt embarrassed to admit that. Everything went fine until after school, I was walking and I felt a girl pushing me from behind. She gave me a rude look and told me to get out of the way, and I ignored her.

She continued to shove me so I stood up for myself and said (in a strict tone back to her) if she can stop shoving me. It was the first time I had EVER done something like that as usually I just ignore people who are rude and I felt surprised in myself for a moment. Then her friend butted in and told me who do I think I am to be talking to her friend like that. Before I know it, all 6 of them (her and her friends) all started shoving me from behind on purpose with their hands while calling me a pig, an ugly b*****, and racist things. They were harassing me, laughing and mocking my words while following me around and I ignored them and stayed silent because I didn’t want to make a scene.

Eventually they ran off but I was so shaken that I started crying. I feel so ashamed of myself to let myself get pushed around by these girls who are 1-2 years younger than me. It feels so ironic that on the one day I looked “normal”, I ended up getting harassed and touched anyway. The shoving hurt the most because the whole reason I hate being touched is because I was physically abused when I was younger. It doesn’t help that I was also bullied (and my bullies hit me as well).

I couldn’t stop crying and my parents got angry at me. I don’t know if reporting it will even do anything because 1. there were multiple girls and I didn’t get to see all their faces, 2. they were all similar looking and wearing the same outfits, and 3. I don’t know their names. After they ran off I had an opportunity to take a photo of them but I realised I had left my phone at home.

I don’t know if this is the appropriate place to post this. But I feel very sad right now. Today I learned that no matter what I do, I will always end up getting made fun of anyway.",1
"Thoughts about getting a diagnosis I recently got diagnosed with ASD, by a psychiatrist. It should also be said that i struggle a lot with imposter syndrome, as I can't 100% see myself in the most common ""symptoms"" of ASD so to say. I do believe that I do have ASD though, but I find it hard to be completely certain. 

I thought getting diagnosed involved a longer process with many session over a couple of months. I had two sessions only. It didn't really seem that official, and ended a bit more abrupt than what I had imagined. I haven't really had time to think ahead or thought about which further steps to go, after getting diagnosed.

So now I'm kinda like, yeah ok. I guess I have ASD... What do I do now? Do I phone a friend? Do I join a community?
What does one typically do after getting diagnosed?

I feel kinda lost tbh.",1
"Undesirable career options Hello everybody! I've been diagnosed around two weeks ago. Since then I have dedicated time to research what could be a better fit for me in terms of careers and just life in general.

The career options make me depressed. Cashier, janitor, accountant etc. 

Any suggestions? Opinions? What do you guys do and do you enjoy it?",1
"Trying to figure out if I have sensory issues with clothes. What it it like to be bothered by them? My first reaction would be to say that no I don't have issues with clothes. My big sensory issues are noise, light and taste. And yet I look at my behavior and I have literally worn the same shirt (aka same company and style) for over a decade, same with pants. I don't really know what's it's like to wear a shirt with tags since the one I always wear doesn't come with them, but I'm pretty sure when I was little I didn't like them and my mom always cut them off for me. Sorry if this is tmi but I don't like wearing most underwear, I only have one thing that I wear and it's very lose which is why I like it. 

So I still don't really know if I have an issue with clothes, but if not it is odd I've worn the exact same clothes for over a decade. I do know I've had alot of coats that once they age a bit the interior texture is just awful and I can't wear them. 

Id really appreciate if people could share their experiences with this one, especially if your more mildly bothered by textures and clothes. It took me awhile to realize I actually dident like certain noises or people touching. My behavior always subconsciously avoided those things so I never noticed, it's currently happening with smell. Same might be true for clothes.",1
"Trouble concentrating I’ve never had difficulty concentrating before. The past couple of months have been increasingly hard.

I feel like I’m battling depression as well, but I’ve gone through that before and never had this focus issue.

Never diagnosed with ADHD, but I understand there’s it’s not an uncommon diagnosis for us. 

For work, I enjoy spreadsheets (I can get in the zone) but that’s not been my main activity of late.  I’m in my late 30s.

Any recommendations?",1
"I feel like upon not masking I lost a lot of skills. Is it a bad thing or an ok thing? I used to be so on top of things. I would speak up a lot and participate, I always did things right away. I was very stressed out living like that. I can’t describe it very well but I basically was functioning a lot “better” if you want to call it that. But eventually I started having insomnia a few nights a week and was pretty high anxiety about everything. 

As years passed and I got older, and eventually was diagnosed, I began to stop masking. I began to stop feeling like I always had to talk, I began not living my life on this very strict schedule of things that I simply must do. I like schedules but it was like I didn’t allow myself to relax and I still don’t know if I allow myself to relax enough. 

Last week for the first time in years I didn’t take a shower until the afternoon. I can’t stand how I feel when I don’t shower, but it’s like I forgot what it was like to just relax and do exactly what I felt like doing in the moment. Even on a day off I feel like I’m supposed to live my life a certain way. That certain way has everything to do with what would make me feel like I am a functioning adult who is doing what they are supposed to do. 

I may like structure but it’s as if my life has unnecessary structure and scaffolding around it. I am never natural. I used to be a long time ago. My days were whatever they ended up being and I very much lived in the moment. But it’s like I can’t be that way anymore. 

In living more honestly and not masking as much I kind of feel like I am failing at life now. I’m less on the ball as I used to be but to be honest I’m not sure I could ever go back to masking so much. I feel like I learned important life skills but I’ve just lost them. 

I don’t know how to describe what my problem is or figure out what it is I’m trying to ask here. I guess that I used to live so differently for so long and I really thought that I found myself but realized I hadn’t. I think I am still trying to find who I truly am at almost 40. 

When I live my life more relaxed and less hectic it kind of makes me depressed and worried. I get done all the things I am supposed to get done but it’s almost like those things have become even more difficult to do at all. 

It’s like, if I want to live a more relaxed life it’s going to seep into a lot of other things. It’s like I can’t just be relaxed in some instances and more on the ball in other instances. 

If something needed to be done I would just go out and do it, but now it’s like my whole life feels upside down if I need to do something out of the ordinary. But was that just masking? Because if I think further back in my life I’m not so sure that I was ever so on top of everything. I had to learn how to do those things. 

I feel like I regressed in a way. In a way it’s fine but in another way it made my life more difficult. Is this really burnout or masking? These are things that I’m still trying to work out in my head. So I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Sometimes when I write something and I put it out there I feel like I can analyze it in a different way so thank you for giving me the space to be able to do that even if my post doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.",1
"Too Unwell to Enjoy Special Interests Hello all,

I wonder if you have any advice - I’m not looking to complain, just to lay out my situation and see if anything can be done.

As you all know, not being able to follow and enjoy your special interests can be hard. I’m in a situation in which I have a neurological illness that keeps me very limited in what I can do - most importantly (and most impairing to an extent) is my cognitive faculties.

I can’t ‘ponder’ over things or barely read a page of a book as I get too unwell very very quickly.

Too much input (and really it is very little) can make me much worse, whether visual, auditory or just thinking.

How can I enjoy special interests or even hobbies? 

One of my favourites is searching for mathematical patterns in prime numbers or creating financial algorithms and exploring certain aspects of maths.

Others are linked to military history and so on - I won’t bore you with too much details - the point is I can’t really use my cognitive functions any more so feel quite stuck & frustrated.

Advice welcome.",1
"What I’ve realized about flirting that happens a lot more than I used to think it does Ok so apparently lot of people will flirt just because it’s fun and they’re bored, not because they’re actually into you.

"Difficulty living alone   

Sorry for my English, not a native speaker.

Does anyone have the same problem as I do? I have no idea what’s wrong with me. I live alone and if I spend a couple of days without speaking to anyone face to face, (I usually go outside and go to cafes), I start to feel terrible. My body starts to ache, I can’t sleep well. When I’m lying in bed and about to fall asleep, suddenly I feel like something touches my heart and after that, I’m not sleepy at all. 

Previously I was at uni and craved living alone. I got my own apartment and soon dropped out of uni for the second time. I just needed time to relax away from people. After a while, it got better and something changed in my brain wirings. I didn't want to socialize at all in my teenage years and suddenly I started to crave it. I wanted to go back to uni so badly, I thought I'll better handle social part of being a student, but thanks to executive dysfunction I was too late to apply. I think that's when I noticed this problem. I started to visit my mom once in 3 days, didn't think much about it, but later she moved far away. And I started to struggle. I tried to visit my relatives, but it’s not ok to visit them that often. I got an office job(I hated working at office), made a few friends, and still had the same problem if I couldn’t speak with them and when I stayed at home on the weekends. Then we went remote and I struggled again. I tried different supplements, thinking it is some sort of vitamin deficiency, and tried to just speak to people on the phone. Nothing helped.

I don’t even want to socialize that much with my relatives. It's hard to go outside and follow plans due to executive dysfunction. It all starts so suddenly. I don't feel an urge, Just some time passes and boom, depressive mood, everything hurts, can't sleep. 

From what I’ve researched people usually don’t live well in social isolation. But I don’t think it’s normal in my case, it’s happening too fast and the effect is too strong. I’ve never heard of other people that had a similar experience. I want to move to another city.

Are those panic attacks? Is my brain broken? Could it be my amygdala? I suspect my amygdala is too big and overactive. I probably should visit a doctor, but I’m afraid they’ll say “just talk to people more”. Last fall I went to a psychiatrist for my seasonal depression and mentioned my anxiety briefly at the end of the session. She said I don’t want to go out because of my depression. I took some antidepressants. They didn’t have much effect on me.

Can you give me some advice? I really need some advice.",1
"Why “be yourself” only really works for NTs I think NTs brains naturally stay on topic. So if they just mention what’s on their minds, people will still be able to interact with them. They’re just naturally in the moment and more or less on topic. My brain doesn’t work like that. People might be talking about work or whatever, while I’m mostly thinking of something completely off-topic like Finnish grammar. 

When that happens I’ll just have nothing to say. There shouldn’t be anything wrong with Finnish grammar, but that’s just completely off-topic. People get caught completely off-guard when I’m too off-topic. If I have a lot of energy, I’ll end up on topic and be able to participate. If I ask for any advice on how to deal with interactions and mention the work I have to put into them, people just accuse me of “not being myself”.

Sure I could exclusively hang out with people interested in Finnish grammar, but I don’t think that will work. My mind is just naturally off-topic. If it’s not Finnish grammar, it could be a million other things. Finnish grammar is only one example. It could be interchanged with pretty much anything. It could even be something more normal like sports. If people are talking about their day to day life, no one wants to hear about some obscure sports trivia. Even people into sports. If I have a bit more energy or motivation, I can kind of make small talk a game for me. But I guess that’s “masking” and masking isn’t okay. I just need ways to not be bored out of mind and I guess thinking of special interests or random topics accomplishes that. 

Maybe people will argue with me and say be yourself doesn’t mean ____. That just proves it’s only good advice for NTs. They can figure out what it actually means, while I can’t. I don’t think be yourself should be given as advice for me at all. It’s not even relevant if I’m being myself or not. I just find that the less autistic I act, the more fun I have in interactions. I guess people care more about empty sayings than me enjoying myself.",1
"Did your Asperger's influence your choice of study? I've seen many say that computer science/IT stuff is the preferred study of autistics, because we tend to be analytical.

In my case it's a bit different - I've always had an inability to understand the concept of injustice as well as rationalise it. I get very irrationally angry when faced with it and *have* to react or else I feel stifled. I'm thinking that may be why I was attracted toward Law.

"Accommodations At Work? After a hell of a weekend and an emergency therapy session this morning, my therapist is recommending I talk to work about accommodations. I have autism and ADHD. Though I was diagnosed about ten years ago (in my adult life), I have never asked a job for accommodations. This is my first job that I really love and I have only been here for a few months. However, she pointed out that it would be better for me to ask for accommodations for me to still love it and still do well in it long term, which I would like. I have a tendency towards burnout. In the last 4 or so years, I have probably had like 5 months of short term disability due to major burn out issue, which I am trying really hard to avoid.

Here are my two problems: 1) I never told my work about my diagnosis because I didn't want to not get my job because of it. Though I have talked about seeing a therapist in general, so maybe that will be fine?

2) I am not really sure what to ask for. My therapist and I will work together in the next week or so to plan some of this. She recommends a day or two a month of unpaid leave if I need it, and the ability to work from home if I need it. What else do people ask for? What should I be asking for?

How does this process work for most people? I am trying to prepare myself.",1

"I hate my peers (20M) Is it normal form us with Aspergers to like talking to people who are older than us rather our peers? 

I find older adults (such as my father or grandfather) much more mature and seem to have better conversations with them than stupid Gen-Z kids.

My mom says I need to have more friends but I respond with, “none of my peers have any hobbies mom besides stupid stuff like clubbing or TikTok. I know I may hyperfocus on random stuff like baseball, music history, U.S. President history, and silly anatomy stuff like congenital heart defects (I’m majoring in Nursing lol), but at least it’s SOMETHING. These kids are brain dead about everything. 

My peers (college kids) have no passion about their major, have a horrible taste in music (and I have listened to over 700+ albums from country to heavy metal music),  are addicted to social media, and are weirded out when I say anything about my “special interests”.

"Masking and dating I've been having an issue where I'll start dating someone, but they'll only have seen me in 'social mode'.
It's then hard to show them the more divergent parts of my personality. 
It's frustrating to know someone likes a version of you that you can only be some of the time.
Once I realise this I often start acting differently too, avoiding contact or being more closed off when we hang out. As I want to act well but I'm too exhausted to then.
It's really hard to explain myself too; as it often hurts their feelings acting like this, so it's an emotional conversation to navigate when I'm tired so I get snappy. 
I feel like it's almost impossible for me to be in a relationship without someone who is more accommodating than is reasonable. It almost makes me feel manipulative.
Then all of this ties to identity issues as to what part of my personality is really me, and if I want to give in and live like a hermit or keep trying to fit in.

"I had a date Autistic ADHD with CPTSD F30 here and my love life has been a joke. 
Tbh I wasn't interested in building relationships anymore. 

But me and my friend, who I didn't know that well, started to talk one day. We went on a date and spent the whole day together. We just talked and talked. 

I hope I'm not wrong but it felt different. I didn't feel anxious, I wasn't looking for warning signs as I usually do. I felt peace. 

I have used sex to create intimacy before.  Recently decided not to do that anymore. But with him I didn't feel like I even had to keep it in mind. He didn't touch me, we didn't kiss. I have realized that I need time to adjust and taking things slowly is perfect for me.

"Has anybody ever tried to tell you that you don’t have Asperger’s because your making eye contact? I had these online zoom calls with a therapist who specialized in diagnosing Asperger's.

"Learn from people who grow up in hardcore environments I moved to a 3rd world country and trough my sport I meet people from the lower working class who live very tough lives. Since the day they were born they had no chance really and they have resigned with the fact it's never going to be better. Some of their coping mechanisms are inspiring to me: 

Most have developed a strong ability to **ignore certain parts of their life**. They can't survive while dwelling on all the details of their situation. 

Most have **no expectations** of anything, but are **opportunistic**. When a chance presents itself they will grab it and work hard to get something out of it, but they expect nothing.

When they complain, it is about something specific that influences their life that very moment. And it never includes 'because I am poor'. Even though poverty creates problems for them, they don't dwell on their origin. 

When things are good for a little while, they **really enjoy the moment** and defend it with their life. Like: this could be the one good thing in my week, I won't let anyone mess this up and I don't think about tomorrow.

They are **proud** of the fact their difficult lives made them hard people who can take life in the face every day. 'People with comfortable lives maybe more happy, but they are also a bunch of pussies.'

No room for a victim mentality. They **suffer trough every day**, but they count those days as **personal victories**.

Their answer to 'how are you' is 'still going' or 'creating desire (to keep going)'.",1

Saying I'm autistic always makes me feel weird because I feel like I have to go in depth. When I call myself an Aspie I do it with a little flourish like ""Yeah I'm an Aspie 😩🥴🥰✨"" because I think it's easier to be lighthearted about it rather than people give me those stupid sympathy eyes.

"I don't understand why I am treated differently at work Just started a job as a pharmacy tech and it's largely been going very well, but I'm sensing a barrier between me and my coworkers. Like my manager who was actually hired after me talks alot with the other tech and it just seems like they converse so naturally. And there's just this awkwardness between me and the others, it's like they don't know what to say to me often. They used to begin conversations with me when I started but now they just like... don't. Almost all of use are brand new and recently met eachother and yet I'm feeling excluded. 

And for the life of me I don't understand what I am doing that is causing this. As far as I can tell I am acting just like the other tech, I feel like I'm socializing normally and doing everything right. So what the heck am I doing wrong? And to be clear everyone I work with are all nice and respectful, we get along well. I just feel like I'm being treated differently and I don't get why. Does anyone have any advice here? This is my first job so I'm new to this sort of environment, I feel like I'm doing very well in the job itself but I'm struggling socializing. Anyone have similar experiences?

Edit: Someone asked for more context. The reason I don't understand is half the people I'm working with are also brand new and started after me.

My school is making my life a living hell quite honestly, since I'm not interested in the slightest. I'm studying to be a classical guitar teacher and I just couldn't give less of a f. I got there cus I'm a good player since I started when I was 7 and my dad was my teacher.. Then I guess I kinda went for it as my profession cus it's fun to play and my dad would b happy and being a musician sounds cool...

I desperately want out now. I have students tomorrow at 5PM and already when I woke up today I couldn't relax cus I just remember tomorrow I have to go teach which sucks.

"Education and curriculae Anyone else having trouble keeping motivation to continue following boring curriculae at your studies? 

The lack of freedom in how far one can go out of scope bothers me; it always did. In a way the whole schooling system killed my creativity and curiosity at a very young age. Elementary was way too easy and boring. At high school some subjects were okay I guess like the exact subjects I liked very much. But I disliked the way it was thaught and I missed the why of things. I asked why do we learn this particular topic? To which I got this reply: You need to get good grades in order to get a degree so you can do something you like and earn a lot... 

That was what I was being told by my Math teacher. The same one that killed my interest in Maths. We had to solve problems I always came up with a ""different"" for him incorrect way of solving problems. Therefor always got bad grades. Then one time for a few months we had another teacher and my grades were very good. 

Lately I've studied some more Math and technical subjects on my own. And I like it much more now then when I was younger. 

It's just that I started a new study again and I'm running in the same viscious downward energy draining boring ""you have to do xyz-death circle"" That killing me softly thing again. 

Although self-study for me is better; majority of employers are looking for these overly valued degrees in my opinion. 

When you say that you do a self-study in insert any topic:...... it's not good enough. Even if you can prove your skills in a certain area of competence chances are like you/me being rejected for some other candidate with a degree. 

I'm pun intended on college graduates. You worked hard too but I think there should be more recognition for people who don't have a degree and work equally as hard or even harder; who get rejected by simply: hmm, no degree bla bla.

"Can someone share advice/experience regarding being on the spectrum with severe interpersonal difficulties and the desire or lack of to have interpersonal relationships and possibly answer social security questions. Sorry it is long, but I am desperate. I'm trying to figure out if I need to help my son. He was diagnosed Asperger's Syndrome and Generalized anxiety disorder many years ago. He told me he was asexual in his teens, although he did have a crush on a girl when he was in grade school. He doesn't have friends. He is 26 and lives with me. He has an online gaming life and does Door Dash, as that didn't require he apply/interview. He did have a job at a pizza place where his boss loved him and even bought a car for him so he could get to work, after my son's car died, so that he wouldn't lose him as an employee. He is very intelligent. He passed high school (with a C average) by acing tests and doing no assignments. He did well on the ACT, went to college for a full year and failed out. He is very uncomfortable asking for help. He has serious blood pressure issues due to an accident when he was a child that requires daily medication. He excels at table games and gets quite competitive, and in role playing games takes on characters and comes alive. Most of the time he is without affect. He is an adult and I try to give him autonomy and not treat him like a child. He pays for his car and insurance, although once in awhile late. I asked him to pay a small amount of rent ($100). He paid for one month and stopped. 

So recently I asked him about his medication and found out he hadn't taken it in months, he was out. I forced him to take his BP and it was close to stroke level. It isn't regular high BP, he suffers severely high BP which can lead to his organs shutting down. He aged off my insurance this year, so no insurance. I found a clinic that wasn't too expensive and took him there and got him meds. They want him to see a specialist. His BP went down to borderline high after a week on meds, so he is safe in that respect now. I asked him if he wanted to die. His answer was, ""meh"". Like I don't care. That is his general answer to anything feels involved, or requiring interaction. Just to be clear, if he is game playing, or talking about things he knows/facts, he is eloquent and quite verbal. It is only life/interpersonal/emotional where he shuts down. He did tell me he avoids coming downstairs because he doesn't want to have conversations with us about life issues. Health, job, possible school or training, chores, how he's doing...

My questions... For people who may have similar struggles. Does he really not care about finding someone who will be a partner? Does he not desire friends? Can he be content in his life without these things? Is there something that would help me get him to open up? I finally got him to sign up at vocational rehabilitation to see what job training he could qualify for. He has no clue what he wants to do though, or he can't/won't verbalize it to me. I make suggestions he just stares at me or says, ""meh"". Yes, he will look me in the eyes. This is due to my turning his head when he was young and making him look at me, before I even had a clue about ASD. He stares and you can just see the discomfort and anxiety. :( You can tell he is uncomfortable. So, he told voc rehab he wants a job where he can support himself. I assume this is so he can get out of my home and not have to talk about anything. We got his diagnosis records and I had him forward them a couple weeks ago. I asked yesterday if he had heard from them, he said no. I had to request that he contact them again, which he may or may not do. I can't imagine him out there, solitary, with no one in his life except random gamers online. Do those of you who live this way find it satisfying, or do you feel lonely? I can't assume to know what he is thinking/feeling or that it is anything like what I think/feel and am trying to figure out how best to help him. Can someone offer insight into the thought processes he might be having if you feel you have similar etymology of your ASD? I would normally try counseling, but he won't talk, so how would it help?

Could he get social security/disability to help even though he is technically working? It would help a lot if he could get medicaid. As far as adding him to my insurance as a disabled adult child, I was freaked out by the medical form asking for percentages of function from a doctor. He showers, gets dressed, goes to work. He functions. I feel like they wouldn't understand the level he doesn't function at because at glance he is doing basic tasks. They don't know that when forced to apply for jobs as a teen he was so anxious he drove the truck somewhere, parked and cried for a couple of hours rather than actually applying anywhere. Or how he sat at a table for five hours doing nothing more than staring at a paper rather than write a homework assignment because he didn't want to do an assignment that he didn't know the outcome of, whether it would be 'perfect'. 

Someone please help me figure out what I can be doing to help improve his quality of life. What services should I seek out that don't cost an arm and a leg?

I did not really understand why people are so obsessed with making friends and feel so sad when they don’t have, and I still do not really do yet. I did not have friends in all my childhood and preteen ages and I lived very happily. Like, I suppose that everyone here lives happily even without a space rocket. To me, friends were like space rockets. I was perfectly fine even without one.

But when I entered teenage years, and I got a new therapist, she kept to encourage me to make friends, and my family/school half forced me to, making me think that maybe I did need friends. Those two years became exhausting and stressful, because basically I was almost “forced” into to do something that I did not need to and that wasted my energy. I did not understand why.

These days I realised that actually I do perfectly fine even without friends and I always did, and that when my friends “left me”, I didn’t feel sad at all (even I should be, technically) and I felt fine. Like, I was like, yeah it happened, but it was not catastrophic.

See, when you go on internet and search loneliness, everything you find is how to fight it, how to not be lonely, how to accept it, but I realised I do not relate at all, like, if other people start to be stressed and sad because they are lonely, I was being the opposite, because I socialised too much.

I actually feel way more myself and free when I think that it is okay that I do not make friends and I can perfectly live in a society without making friends. Now, is this common among all the Aspergers or, most Aspies actually WANT friends but do not know how to make them?

I got diagnosed officially at 12 years old. I was almost 13.",1
"I feel like I'm a crackhead (embarrassed for addiction). They laugh at me another subreddits even the ones that are said to be supportive I hear (see) it more often than I should. 

For instance anytime when in an argument with someone, where they have a contrasting or opposite opinion of me, all they have to do is click on my profile and boom, this guy is like a 30-year-old unemployed weed addict and that is close to true. I'm a 27m odd job worker only a few times a week/month depending on what's available. Good summer hours, poor winter and spring/fall moderate. 

It is true I have an addiction to marijuana and I have taken great pleasure in the times that I've gone without it. 

I did 168 days without Alcohol last year the goal was to do a minimum of 145 days sacrificing my time (wallet and liver approve) for the 29 men who died on a great lakes (5) ship, The S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on November 10, 1975 and had $145 of 29 American 5 dollar bills ready for April 27th, as December 3rd was my last use date and didn't touch the money until May.  

But my two biggest breaks without smoking weed are just shy of 2 months, one of them in a leap year. I did 58 days last year (MR4-MY1) and 59 days in 2020 (FE15-AP14) to which unfortunately included a February 29th in that time. Otherwise I would've hit two months to the day. 

Now I struggle to go even a day without it. It seems much easier say when on vacation where I can't smoke for a week or two enjoying my time vs forced to go without because of financial struggles and sitting at home bored. It's common in most drug addicts to struggle financially but the legal weed here is cheap. Ounces generally go for $100-140 depending on quality. 

But I do feel some jealousy when some people can achieve goals like going say years without weed but everybody's different. There may be someone that hasn't went a week without smoking up in the past 10 years but has been without alcohol for decades and a proud of that. Others never used either but I don't feel I should be having to compare myself to others. I did go a near 16 years without smoking from birth to when I first used afterall LOL.  

Facebook I've been 8 months without, Video games 17 months, imagine those durations without for weed my dreams would get very intense, perhaps too intense at times. I'd rather be able to use say once a month consistently for years, that to go years without just to go right back to everyday again the moment I smoke up.",1
"Is it possible to diagnose ASD as an adult? I don't know if I have ASD or it's just Social anxiety combined with other behavioral issues.
When I searched online I have found that there is no definite test for diagnosing ASD. So can any of you please suggest me how to know for sure?",1
"i think i have Asperger's. or am i just different? so i think i \*may\* have Asperger's. i have ocd however fyi.

so i was more interest in things than in people. if i get bored or of something someone is doing, i do not stick around. i have my own strong interests and for this reason its really hard to make friends, iv always been and felt like a outsider, even in sports, and i like doing things my way! i started talking to adults more in my teen years since i hated the culture of others my age, there not good friends and are mean not anly that i struggle to play as its very rare to have similar interests as me

 although im overly talkative and go on tangents. i just don't connect to others its ALL surface. and i can't keep a conversation going very very well because i don't like to talk about things i don't like to talk about, if we talk about something i will go into EVERY DETAIL I CAN FIND. having a conversation or telling a story can turn into a maze.

i sometimes struggle with things like misunderstanding, assumptions, sarcasm, and seem to have a different sense of humour than anything else, if a joke is illogical its not funny(unless its clever or \*random\*) however i am a real joker(i find puns in every thing) i do understand unliteral things as i like finding hidden meanings in things so i have no problem understanding in this area and have become very philosophical i have a knack for understanding concepts(and putting two and two together) but cannot explain my thoughts well(iv always struggle to express my thoughts and ideas)

i like to think everything logically and im so curious and nosy i get told off for being so curious (why do you need to know, or that's rude)  im the king of oversharing and talking about the same thing way too much, i have to make sense of everything and can't stand conflicting information. way to open to other people. and often don't understand how friendships and social boundary's operate its hard to tell whats acceptable and whats not. i aften need someone to explain something in more detail for me to understand. i want to know how everything works and decode things... overthink everything. and i was bullied in school and targeted and called things and i don't know why. im not dumb i am just different. 

is obsessive apologising and need to explain yourself to others a common thing? i dread rejection and misunderstanding.

i am good at coordination/balance but i often make big errors in aim at times and instead of catching something i hit it. don't even ask me about writing and grammar...

people describe me as \*intense\* easily excitable.

i love eating with teaspoons, i have favourite things, i find objects cute, i love stimming for fun. and i unconsciously do it when stressed...

 idk about fashion or social norms. instead i can be very argumentative and try and impose my point across they have to know what i think and i try to use logic, i question things that most people do not. very technical at times. 

my only sensory issue i notice is high sensitivity to touch. i don't like being touched or restricted/crowded.  but despite this im always touching things and sometimes i do not feel it when i get scratched. idk whats your opinion pls?",1
"Is pacing around when anxious or engaged in conversation ""stimming""? Pacing around is a compulsive behaviour from my early teenage years that I only do now when I'm agitated, lost on thought, or talking on the phone (though I do prefer to walk and talk rather than sit and talk now that I think about it).

"Have you managed to remain friends with your ex? My now ex-girlfriend broke up with me (both aspies) last night due to distance, but wants to remain friends.

"I don't have trouble with changing routines when its reasonable and for good cause They say ASD folks are highly routinized and may have difficulty changing their routines, relative to NTs, I guess is implied there.

But actually, am I alone here?, I feel like I'm immensely more flexible than NTs in one very key way: making small adjustments to improve day-to-day routines/functions/processes when there is good reason to do so.

Because *if* a change in my routine has good cause/reason that I understand, it usually only takes me a few attempts to habituate the change and routinize it. Of course, I personally have to juror the reasonableness and agree that it is indeed good reason, but if I do come to believe that there is good reason for change I can make the change effortlessly, indeed, I will absolutely relish optimizing my routine with this new important insight. And I have a tendency to be impatient with folks struggling to update their ways.

NTs.... I feel like because they aren't so thoughtful and rationale-obsessed as I am, being given a good reason to change something doesn't have the same power on them that it does on me.  Like, even if they agree that I have given good reasons that we, as a household or work force, should do X thing ""my way,"" they aren't able to incorporate it quickly or easily, they apologize or make excuses, or slow roll and drag their feet so as to passive-aggressively lodge a complaint, even though I truly believe them when they say my rationale is very persuasive.  But if it's persuasive, how can it be difficult for them to remember it and implement it?   I've gone my whole life thinking people are lying to me when they say I have convinced them that i have good reason for my requests but then they don't follow the logic of my request.  Like.... what do I not understand? But now I'm starting to think it's just ND/NT difference, not dishonesty.

Example, multiple housemates leave dishes in their bedrooms.  I tell them to try to get into the habit of always bussing one set of dishes from their room to the kitchen each time you are headed to the kitchen for food (if not sooner), but they just can't seem to implement it, even though they agree this makes life much easier for them, the kitchen will no longer be perpetually depopulated of silverware and such, etc etc. Even though we all agree on what is optimal, folks still have a hard time doing that.  I can't really empathize. I only have trouble with unreasonable or poorly reasoned requests.",1
"Why is discussion of Asperger's as a life-ruining disease suppressed, while discussion of Asperger's as a ""superpower"" or as a ""personality quirk"" is encouraged? It is the root of my misery, it is the root of misery for millions, but when searching for support online you only ever see shit like ""it only means you think differently"", ""you can do things other's can't"", and ""your brain is just wired in other ways"". 

Do I need to remind people that most of those with Asperger's are not happily oblivious math gurus who effortlessly coast through life with their genius, but averagely-talented or untalented people trying to achieve normal lives but struggling to offer society the bare minimum, being proven every day that their best effort is insufficient? 
Asperger's sucks if you're an adult, it is a disability and not a "" le quirky personality UwU rawr :3"" that everyone mentions when someone asks for legitimate ways to make their own lives less of a torture.",1

Sorry if this is the wrong place Hi I have an 8 year old daughter who was diagnosed with Asperger’s a few years ago. Since October she started having panic attacks. They weren’t very often until a few weeks ago now she has them every other day but can’t explain to me why. I have no idea how to help her. Iv spoken to her school who said they get a someone to speak to her soon that was almost a month ago. I can’t get her a doctors appointment as there’s not enough to go around and it isn’t serious enough. I would love any advice.,1
"Navigating social media? I’m going to start this post by saying that I do not a diagnosis yet but I actually have had some non-neuropsych tests done in both childhood and when I was an adult that have shown it is likely I have high-functioning autism and I have some mental health professionals saying I have it as well. I’m having a neuropsych test soon!

Anyways, social media has always been a struggle for me. I’ve never really seen the purpose of posting your life for everyone to see. I actually did run a instagram account and Snapchat a few years ago but later closed them due to a fallout with a few people and getting hurtful messages. Even then I didn’t really post much outside of memes and my art. 

I don’t think I want to have a social media like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc. ever again. It seems hard, crafting posts, gaining a following, posting aspects of your life, knowing what to say, etc etc. I also don’t think I have enough friends for social media? I have a few sure but not a great amount. It seems like a rift between me and other people sometimes. I see people sharing snapchats and instagrams and I just don’t have one. And I feel awkward and uncomfortable about that but

Reddit seems different, I don’t know why. There are communities for the most specific of things and singular games and shows and I really like that. And it doesn’t seem reliant on building a following? Yet I still seem frozen on how to begin to interact? How to start building up an account and such

Does anyone here have any tips on how they do it? Or started to do it?",1

"What is being an Aspie to YOU? I have only been on r/aspergers for 1-2 weeks. I read a lot of comments with bitter language or people asking for help. There is this entire debate on how being an Aspie is (1) a Curse (2) a Superpower, (3) both (4) neither. I am of the 5th category (5) What is it??? I would love to know what people actually think and why.

My long, long analysis:

Personally, I have suffered from 20 years of depression, anxiety, and being called weird/special/unique for even longer. This has led me to bouts of suicidal ideation, self-harming, meltdowns, missed opportunities, and lost social relationships. More broadly, I never fit in, anywhere. However, my system-based thinking and analytical skills got me through a Ph.D. in biology (with literal blood, sweat, and tears). I see the curse, I see the superpower, I see the both and neither. However, these are all functional descriptors of Asperger's as a label that don't really describe what it IS.

What is Asperger's or ASD in actuality? The science seems tenuous at best. From what I can tell:

1) AS/ASD symptoms and behaviors manifest through interaction with the environment, increased stress, and reduced time and ability to choose how to process things exacerbate symptoms.

2) The genetic basis is shaky. Genetic studies suggest that contributing genes are in the 100s +, and unhelpful independent of the context/environment. 

3) Little is different from an NT brain at the level of individual brain cells (neurons) or even in the number, location, and development of neurons.

4) The neuronal connectivity avenue is most promising but research is still in its infancy. The best (so far?) evidence would suggest that the process of selecting specific brain cell connections (synaptic pruning) occurs less or differently. This would suggest that connectivity parameters are different and often skewed toward retaining more connections that are used in earlier stages of life (neoteny).

5) Sensory sensitivities overlap with hyper-analysis of details. Rather than increase sensitivity in actual sensation, the processing of sensation is amplified making a person more sensitive overall. E.g. eyes are not better at sensing light at a molecular level, but that processing visual information is amplified and thus a person is more sensitive to light.

Conclusion and speculations: AS/ASD is a set of neural networking differences that are under the umbrella of the ""Autism Spectrum"". ASD might even be a collection of networking differences at different scales and locations within the brain that are sensitive to relative timings to what happens in a person's life. This might be why the ""High-functioning"" vs ""low-functioning"" distinction makes me and many others cringe, I am ""high-functioning"" in certain circumstances and ""low-functioning"" in others. Since neural connections within humans change over their life, this might also explain why symptoms can manifest late or even go away. Just food for thought.",1
"Female advice-help please 
I need some advice before I send myself crazy. I’m a 31F and my partner is 30M. I’m his second partner and he has been told before he has mild Asperger’s as a child( this will be important further down). We have been together for four years and also engaged. I am a female who can only orga*m via cl*t stimulation and my favourite thing is oral. When we first got together, we were having s*x and he stopped and told me that my vagi*a smelt bad. I know it didn’t as I have really good hygiene. This really broke me and made me extremely self-conscious ever since this day. He has never gone down on me at all ever and our s*x life consist of him doing his business and I generally just finish myself off with satisfier pro. Occasionally he will play with my brea*t whilst I make myself go with my toy. I can count on one hand how many times he has touched downstairs. Tonight we decided to do the usual of me making myself go with my toy and him playing with my brea*t not long after he started playing with them he stopped and said something smelt ask asked if it was b**b sweat as I have very large brea*t ( I checked and no smell). I always check my odour before doing anything and I knew that it wasn’t me so I told him just to not worry about it and he left the room. Ive always liked oral being performed on me and now I haven’t had it in over four years. I honestly don’t know what to do from here. Our s*x life is so boring and it’s the same thing every time which is not very enjoyable for me. I brought some extra toys to maybe spice it up and now he said he feels like they will be better than him. I understand having autism can cause some people to have an extreme sensitive sense of smell so this is why I’m really torn. Do I want to live the rest of my life never been pleasured
again? All this is really affecting our relationship and I love I have for him. I don’t know whether I’m happy to continue to meet his s*x demands but not mine ( I’ve always put him first) 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺. And the tough thing is, I know he feels bad and apologies for making me feel gross. My brain is literally at a point of questioning my own s*xuality.  If he didn’t have Asperger’s I would say he is just being selfish but I don’t know how to overcome this. I’ve been extremely patient with him and I’ve broken to pieces ( he doesn’t mean to be mean but just says it how it is- no filter). Ahhhhh I’m so torn.",1

"How to help my child’s friendship with a friends kid that may have Asperger’s. I hope this is the appropriate place to ask, please let me know if not. 

One of my closest friends has a child that may have suspected Asperger’s. She’s almost 5 and nothing has been ‘officially’ diagnosed yet, but she’s going through tests. My kid is around the same age so we get together regularly to hang out and so the kids can play. Now, my friends daughter can be the most lovely kid- caring, inclusive, etc etc. However, at the drop of a hat, can do a 180 and be downright mean toward my daughter- doesn’t want her to play with any of her stuff, specifically says _linzertorte_’s daughter needs to leave, also tries to get my attention and not have me pay attention to my own kid, etc etc. 

I don’t want to discourage my daughter from trying to have a friendship with my friends daughter, but she has said to me a few times that she wishes friends daughter could play more nicely. I’ve explained to her that all kids have trouble playing nicely sometimes, but know that with this kid in particular something more is likely going on. 

I guess what I’m looking for is how can I help foster a positive relationship between these 2 kids while not seeming like there’s pressure being put on either of them to be friends. I know kids of parent-friends don’t have to get along, I just want to do what I can to support friendship development in this case because my friends kid will likely have a hard time as she gets older. I also realize that I may be personalizing what I observe between the two of them, so open to hearing any input on this situation!",1
"I Hate Sobriety (Alcohol) Fell off the wagon at Christmas (I used to love it, now I hate it) and I kept drinking. About a week sober now and I hate it. 

Since I started drinking at 18 the longest I have been sober is 8 months and it never got easier. Alcohol just tones the world down and makes it bearable. I can socialise after a little whiskey, it got me over my fear of flying (couldn't get xanax from my psychiatrist, they believe it's prescribed too much), it helped me focus. I miss functional alcoholism.

Unfortunately after a decade of it, it got out of control and now if I drink I can't stop. I can drink a litre and if I could afford it I'd probably drink more. So I kinda have to stop. My liver has minor damage but it shouldn't be permanent. Alcohol withdrawal is hell.

I also have responsibilities so I can't really afford to be drunk all the time.

Not really sure what the point of this post is, I just needed to vent somewhere I guess.",1
"Well…my ADHD covered up the Asperger’s. I just recently got diagnosed with Asperger’s. For years my ADHD overcompensated by making me talk constantly because I was bored. Though, I always remembered not wanting to talk and wishing that I’d just shut up because I didn’t even LIKE talking, but it was an impulse. I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 15 (even after telling my parents for YEARS that I had it. It was super obvious, too, but teachers just thought I was spoiled and my parents just thought I was being a “girl” as I am the only girl they had). After being medicated I became quieter to the point that one of my friends thought I didn’t like her anymore because it became difficult for me to hold a conversation with her. I started going to therapy and it was my therapist to started to notice the Asperger’s symptoms. Lack of eye contact, special interests, some selective mutism (which only developed after being medicated for adhd and bipolar disorder because the impulse of talking went away), sensory issues, auditory processing issues, and hyperlexia (hyperlexia is sometimes seen in individuals with Asperger’s but it’s often not talked about). However, I’m extremely empathetic (like, a true empath) and I’m quite emotional so most people thought there was no way I could have Asperger’s but the lack of empathy and emotion are pretty stereotypical. It’s common, but it isn’t always the case. For a long time that was what made me think I wasn’t on the spectrum at all. That and the fact that I said my first word at 6 months old, but it took me much longer to begin walking…and instead of crawling I rolled everywhere. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Now I tend to go mute when I am overwhelmed or anxious, and I can become snippy when I’m focusing on something and someone tries to interrupt my focus. Also, having ADHD and Asperger’s makes me crave order, but makes it impossible for me to have order in most aspects of my life. 

Apologies for such a long post. I tend to write novels when I’m making a post or even texting someone casually. Most people get really annoyed by it so I apologize by default now.",1

"I've been thinking about double empathy and language acquisition as a child Double empathy demonstrates that in interactions between autistics and non autistics misunderstandings and miscommunications occur far more often than between autistics and autistics or between neurotypicals. 


This empathy required in communication would certainly come into play regarding a child's acquisition of their native language. So hypothetically a child raised by Neurotypical parents might have more trouble acquiring language and the meaning of words and phrases than a child with (an) autistic parent(s). I however doubt that any difficulties or delays would be easily noticeable. This would require a large scale study of of many families over a long period of time and there's many factors to take into account.

"It’s becoming unbearable The social isolation and constant rejection of friendships and romantic interests has really begun weighing on me again. Last time it got this bad I ended up going about five years without socializing beyond what was required to stay employed.

I was just told yesterday by an old high school friend that I’m too quirky for normal people, but even the quirky girls want nothing to do with me since there’s plenty of normal men who like that type of thing. 

The only times I’ve ever had a girlfriend is when I ignored them (I had just assumed they were too good for me so I didn’t bother trying to talk to them) until they literally sat on my lap and made out with me or asked me how many signals they needed to send. That’s happened three times in my life, but I’m nearly 40 and balding and there aren’t really those types of situations with regular interactions to lead to that type of luck anymore so I can’t count on it. 

It seems so bizarre to me that a person would be attracted to someone they perceived as treating them coldly but are not attracted at all if any interest is shown.

Thinking about these things is painful but not thinking about them means I just be content with not doing anything so effectively becoming a hermit. It’s peaceful and I don’t have to tell you all how much fun can actually be had, but it really takes a lot of work to actively uproot the desire to have a friend or life partner.

"People on the Spectrum and honor-shame cultures What exactly is the relationship between people on the autism spectrum and honor-shame cultures, as are found in pretty much all of the continent of Asia, North Africa, and until relatively recently, Eastern and Southern Europe? I ask as a white American man who has traveled across Russia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, and is now knee deep in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and trying to understand where the Arab side is coming from.

[I'm finding little to like, relate to, or imagine myself ever adapting to](https://www.nabataea.net/explore/culture_and_religion/honorshame/), the more I learn and understand. My understanding is that the *sine qua non* of ASD is difficulty in reading people and social situations. Asian cultures, especially Arab culture, seem to require a level of constant and keen social awareness I couldn't possibly aspire to, no matter how hard I tried. My status in Arab, Indian, Chinese, Russian, or Japanese society would always be quite low. I would attract much shame.

But then again, what does it matter? I *am not* Arab or Chinese, and will never have any idea what it might feel like to be raised in one of these honor-shame cultures. I can read about the East and spend as much time there as I want, and I will still filter anything I learn through my upbringing as a Westerner to the core.

I have two theories, which aren't mutually exclusive. The first is that honor-shame cultures simply produce a lot, *lot* fewer people with ASD than my home USA. The same complex soup of environmental and societal pressures that select for a strong honor-shame culture, are the same ones that produce overwhelmingly individuals who have what it takes, cognitively and behaviorally, to survive in such a culture, and not so many people like me who don't. And, by the same token, my own American Western culture has evolved and is evolving in such a direction that *does not* select out nearly as many people whose minds work like mine anymore. In other words, each one of us is more a part and product of the geography, both natural and human, that begat us, than we realize. Saying that I wouldn't make a very good Indian is similar to saying that a fish can't breathe air. Maybe an equal number of people with ASD are conceived in the East, but far fewer of them survive long enough to have children themselves.

My second theory is that people with ASD are born and thrive in honor-shame cultures at equal rates to my own culture, but they cope in a very different way from most people with ASD from my culture, that we would readily neither recognize nor relate to. I say this having been raised in, and adapted to, a cultural bubble of Christian leftist social justice warriors in the USA. The way this has shaped me, has left me deeply ambivalent on the emerging ""Aspie culture"", which largely embraces nihilism, atheism, libertarianism/ classical liberalism, the extremes of geek culture, knowledge-based pissing contests, and a preference for dealing with machines over people. I imagine that the cultures and subcultures one is raised in, and how they do and don't accommodate a person with diminished people smarts, will have a massive effect on how the person copes with these limitations. For example, I can picture an Aspie from an Eastern culture leaning quite hard into meticulously learning the numerous little unspoken rules of their culture's social interaction, and having a rich inner world that's starkly different from their pubic persona, which feels ""mask-like"" but necessary to them.

Would someone in this community who was raised in a typical honor-shame culture, as is the norm in all of Asia, North Africa, and to a lesser extent Eastern and Southern Europe, care to weigh in on this? Are there aspects of *Western* Aspie culture, either online or IRL, that *you* find puzzling or don't relate to?",1
"Growing up in church From when I was a kid I enjoyed church, the part where you sit down for service and just absorb information or taking part in service. The socialising part was always really difficult for me though. I would need to withdraw myself right after church. For a long time I didn’t realise I was struggling with my mental health. I would have mini panic/anxiety attacks. Like whenever I preached I would burst into tears and cry uncontrollably. I had no clue why. I’m not as active in church as much (I would like to be) as I used to be but I feel like people don’t really understand what I go through in order to simply fit in and try to be accepted. I feel like if I did people would just brush it off or say I’m not experiencing God correctly. Sometimes I feel like my church experience is just me conforming and I didn’t really advocate for my needs very well. I started developing a really good mask for church as well. I wasn’t doing anything bad or living a double life but I would guilt trip myself over the smallest things. I find it hard to say no to people. I’m saying all this to say, I’m really trying to find community where I can just be myself to be honest. Where I don’t feel like a fraud and I don’t want to be worshiped, I just don’t want my needs neglected. Friends on the same wavelength.",1
"I wish I was intelligent or had a talent I’m one of these who can’t do anything, I can’t even do simple tasks sometimes and I get confused by the simplest things.

I hate this shit world.",1
"Satisfied with myself, yet feeling alone ""I'm better off all by myself, thought i'm kinda feeling empty without somebody else"" has been the quote that i've been related the most lately

I'm really happy with myself, in fact most of the best moments of my life were when i was having fun alone either playing videogames or singing at home, but there's still a part of me that would like to have some special company, yknow?

It's just so... sad seeing everybody around me have or at least has a relationship while i feel i'm almost a repulsor of people just by being myself

Like, i don't consider myself a bad or unpleasant people, my friends and parents always tell me how much they love me and likes being together with me, but since i've learned that i'm socially weird enough to not attract nobody due to how much i don't actually care if i'm acting weird between people who don't know me, i don't feel my social circle is gonna grow or even not decrease

I'm also really happy with my friends, but it's been more than two months i've lost any disposition or willing of chatting with them—actually, with everybody besides my parents and sisters— that i'm finding myself on a empty hole where eventually i'll be alone 

I feel i'm discovering myself as a incel and... does it has anything to do with autism? Althought not having a font right now, i've read a post talking about a unexpectedly huge percentage of the incels were also autistic (it was on r/ForeverAlone, i guess) and it stuck in my mind since them, any thoughts about it?

 today i'm just feeling empty and well, this post ended up the same way",1
"Our elders are mostly dead; what ASD folks have in common with gay men I'm 40s.  Grew up on the very tale end of the AIDS crisis, so you might say I'm among the eldest generation of gay men alive today most of whom did not have to worry about dying of AIDS (although we can still get HIV, there is no practical reason anymore to die from AIDS).  Anyone much older than me, their numbers were severely thinned by the AIDS crisis.  Perhaps because both my biological grandfathers were dead before I was born, and I had only sisters, and my father didn't like me, I always felt a tremendous loss there, an absence in elder roll models I, as a human being, should have but did/do not.  The gay men ages 60s and 70s alive today... let's just say most of them had some pretty conservative lifestyles during the AIDS crisis to have survived, making them not exactly my role model (there are people with HIV immunity, but they are few -- I met one once).

And now being newly diagnosed ASD, I'm beginning to realize that without any particular data or proof, I think it's the same situation all over again.  Undiagnosed ASD folks would certainly be higher risk for death, imprisonment, etc., at all stages of life but especially midlife getting into old age.  So we know people my age and older were not diagnosed as kids, we know ""the system"" isn't robust enough to get caught up so any midlife ASD person who is still alive is more likely than not to die undiagnosed (and I would guess being an undiagnosed autistic on average puts you in line for early death)

And so here I am again, downline the family tree without role models to look up at.  Again going through life with virtually no one with any real standing to say ""I understand what you're going through.""",1
"Autism destroyed my chance of getting the dream job and I wasted my 20s trying. In therapy FYI

My 20s:I worked fast food, lived  in a prison cell flea infested home with a creepy old man during my  internship, cleaned boats from sunrise to  sunset, lived in a bed bug  infested white trash crackhead house (got scars) where someone drugged  me just for a laugh while his dog attacked mine several times, worked  with racists in Texas, covid took away that job, lost my dog, then I  went to live on a god forsaken island in another prison cell sized  apartment that costed $1200 per month despite the shit water seeping  from the ground when I flushed (I was making only $13 per hour), then I  came to a new career-launching job as a scuba diver at an Aquarium and  got fired in 3 months all cuz my boss didn’t  wanna work harder or  change his coaching methods for an autistic worker so he came up with a  bullshit reason to fire me. I’ve fought so hard….and I’ve been single  and alone throughout all of it. Minus my dog, but now she's gone...

I have lost… I gave my diving career 8 years of my life…8 fucking years  of hard fucking work. I’m tired…and autism makes the human aspect just too hard. I thought I could overcome it, but I can’t fake a personality and hate eye contact. After being fired cuz of it…I’m defeated. I have  NOTHING! I'm unemployed now, relying on my savings. I'm still single at  age 30 with not ONE woman ever  romantically loving me. I live in a small apartment all alone living in a fucking red state.

Unemployment benefits were REJECTED. I'm a short (5'7"") autistic, loser with an ugly face who has no friends, no lover, NOTHING! I wasted my 20s working so  hard to pursue the dreams of a stupid little boy thinking he could overcome any challenge with hard work.

I failed...and now I cross the streets without looking both ways. Hoping  for a car to hit me and finish the job so it's not a suicide. What's the  point anymore of going on? Not like I have a beautiful woman waiting  for me or a dog who needs me to care for her.

"How do I fight the feeling of never being given a chance Before I was even 4, I was (in, my opinion wrongfully) diagnosed with autism, dumped in a special ed program that traumatized me until the 8th grade, was put into a decent high school program that was built in to a really good specialized school but my own motivation issues and unresolved trauma resulted in me never getting the chance to take classes there and I am so sick of everything. I have posted about this before, even basically told my whole life story to different sub reddits only for no one to respond. Why is it that while some kids were put in gifted programs or were in general ed all there life taking the hard classes with dozens of consistently supportive friends, I never got to expirence that, it's not fair it's not fair and now I won't even get to a good college because of how bad my GPA is.

"Is there a way to find out if I am misdiagnosed? I've been diagnosed with asd for about half a year and it answered some questions.Especially why I have strange taste in food and why people think of me as a weirdo.Whoever, there are some things that make me question my diagnosis and if it's right/ the right diagnosis.They go as follows:

\-not really any problems with sound,unless I'm angry/pissed

\-I am immune to lights,unless there too bright and/or changing too fast

\-someone told me that my recent therapist isn't really that professional, and through my personal experience I've noticed that too,so maybe things resulting from my social anxiety could be misinterpreted as asd

\-verbal and nonverbal communication got complicated after noticing the signs of social anxiety,there were only a handful of things I didn't understand and before that talking to others wasn't a problem at all

Of course I am aware that people with autism don't have the exact same experiences,but I genuinely struggle way less than most of my friends with asd,same as I genuiely see people struggle more than I do. So my question is:

Is there a way to make sure I haven't been misdiagnosed? If so, please tell me,it would help a lot honestly",1
"Anyone here with an Asperger parent and willing to share his/her story? I (38m, NT but with mental health issues) grew up with a very odd and emotionally absent father. After many years of confusion and a lot of frustration I came across the topic of AS and it was a perfect explanation. I never talked about it too my father because I always have to walk in eggshells around him and I don't want him to freak out. My mother doesn't want him to get checked because of her fear of stigma and shame. So there probably won't be a diagnosis but I'm convinced that he is a Asperger and finally I have some sense of peace with and understanding for him.

My question is: are there any children of Asperger parents here that would share their experiences growing up with such a parent?

From the beginning of my first childhood memories I remember my father as a nice and very generous and loyal person but emotionally completely unavailable, always (!!) busy with his special interests (doing ""useless"" things on the computer and collecting and sorting stuff like audio cassettes, CDs, copying vast amounts of audio books from the local library - everything without listening to all of it even once etc) but hardly there for his family, again and again having some sort of social drama (with neighbors, colleagues, family, random people on the phone etc), very reduced communication, being known for a very strange and often very rude or offending sense of humor, having complete meltdowns for reasons that were very hard to understand. He generally was always very unpredictable regarding his actions and reactions and and up to this day I would consider him as the only person I know I really can't ""read"".

Growing up with my father I developed some serious psychological problems like socal anxiety and depression. I never felt seen, understood or enough and developed a deep pain and loneliness due to it. I still have a deep fear that people might lash out on me for absolutely minor or seemingly ridiculous reasons which caused a lot of problems especially at college and my jobs. To summarize it I would say that there is no stability nor peace within me and that it was largely caused by all the confusing, frustrating and painful experiences with my father. So that's my story. I'd be happy to read some other stories. Thank you so much.",1

Anyone else see the serious issues with the fact that we diagnose autism in psychology/psychiatry practices? I experience autism as a sensory condition first, a cognitive condition second, and I could honestly give a damn about the about whether resultant behaviors when I’m in an environment or social situation that’s not accessible for my neurotype are socially acceptable. We seriously evaluate this condition on the criteria of how socially unacceptable our behavior is? We completely ignore the underlying mechanism/root cause of the behavior? Come on now… I smell bullshit.

"After 20 years of waiting, I finally got my ears pierced today CW: needles, blood

30M, live in the UK.

First got the idea to get my ears pierced (well, just the left one, to be honest) when I was about 10, but kept putting it off for a number of reasons. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to book a consultation appointment at a studio about 40 minutes away from me by train. Went up today, and got there on time. The piercer who was assigned to me for the consultation was brilliant - we clicked pretty much instantly. It's an LGBTQ+-friendly space, which - given I'm gay - was quite a draw when I was doing my research. And trust me when I say I did quite a bit of research into different jewellery options! The piercer I had was very extensive about the detail she went into, and she could tell I was interested in the whole process. She was very impressed at the level of research I'd done.

After having a look at some of the jewellery options, I was given a few minutes to think about it, and I eventually made my decision to go ahead with it. Made my choice of jewellery (which she actually said she thought I'd go for when I initially mentioned that particular style), filled out the consent form, and had to get some cash out from somewhere while the jewellery was sterilised - for the record, I wasn't aware of this beforehand, and it's only because the reception in the studio isn't good enough for a card machine. Given I used to volunteer in a Christian bookshop where we'd have to take the card machine outside for it to work, I can sympathise! Eventually returned, and went through to one of the rooms where I was able to see everything get set up. The set-up took a fair bit of time, and I did ask for the marks on my lobes to be repositioned so they were slightly higher, which was completely fine. Ears were cleaned before and after the marks went on my ears, then it was time for the clamp to go on.

It was time.

I gave my consent for the right lobe to be done, breathed in, and then breathed out. It was over fairly quickly, and then the jewellery went in. Took a few seconds, and then the left lobe was done through the same process. Ended up having a bit of blood from the left one, but I was told this does happen sometimes. Went to the mirror to have a look, and I was so happy. The 20-year wait was worth it. Got given a leaflet on aftercare, a bottle of sterile saline solution for the aftercare, and a couple of stickers for being a brave boy. We were then done, and I left, feeling so happy that it was finally done. Need to go back in a few weeks' time to get the posts downsized (they put longer ones in to account for swelling during the healing process), but that's not a problem. Decided to treat myself afterwards by getting a few books and a couple of LEGO models (if anyone's interested, I got a freebie due to spending a certain amount in total, and the main item was the DeLorean from *Back to the Future*) before then heading to the station to go home.

So, was I happy with my decision? Yes. Absolutely. It's gonna take some getting used to, but I'm sure I'll be OK. My parents have absolutely no idea, as they've gone away for the weekend, but I'll have to talk to them about it when they return. They can't try to claim I haven't done my research, because I definitely have. Also, it's not like I've gone and got something really insane - the studs look quite simple and classy. It was on the expensive side (£120 including the initial deposit), but that's no problem. I wanted to make sure I got them done properly.

If anyone wants to see the photos, they're on my profile. If anyone has any questions, I'm more than happy to try and answer them.",1
"Others making plans for you. Ugh. Just happened. A grandmother encouraging her niece to join me (32F) on my daily walk around town (small mountain village, nobody around and trees and peace).

I usually don't even want my dad to come with me because I like to be alone with my thoughts and relax before I dive back into work.

Why do people think it's OK to schedule themselves into other people's free time?",1
"ASD PSA ""Sorry"" has two meanings In the context of for example someone's relative dying it is common in English for one to say ""I'm sorry"" but the person saying sorry in this situation is not responsible for the death of said relative and is not asking forgiveness. 
Sorry as defined by webster's online dictionary is as follows:
feeling sorrow or sympathy
I'm so sorry for your loss.
We were very sorry to hear the news.
She felt sorry for him. [=she felt sympathy and concern for him because of his situation, problems, etc.]
He told me to stop feeling sorry for myself. [=to stop indulging in self-pity


But that's not the main definition or use of the word. The main use and definition is as follows:
feeling regret or penitence
He was sorry about what he had said.
""I wanted to apologize,"" she said, ""for my abominable rudeness in laughing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know why I did it. I'm sorry.""

Many autistics who grow up in an English speaking culture/environment (which includes me) will pick up on the second given definition of ""Sorry"" without problem while acquiring the language. The first give Definition often eludes and confuses us UNLESS we happen to look up the definitions of  word sorry in a dictionary or encyclopedia which I did. 

What other words confuse you?",1
"Have you ever felt that you have reached your limit of possible interests? Recently, I have been struggling with finding/starting new interests as of late.  
I have gotten all my current special interests to a level where it is hard to even keep them up  
to standard. (The further I am, the easier it becomes to get rusty, so I keep them in my schedule.)

I always have this nagging sensation in the back of my mind to dive into something new,  
like music, history, industrial engineering, or whatever that grabs my attention.  
But it never fits my schedule, and I always have to sacrifice something to get into something new.

I found my limit at having a full-time job and two special interests.  
If I put a third one into the mix, I will get burned out in 1 to 2 months.

"How to not be hurt by people's perception of autism/bullying? Yeah... 

I'm not trying to bring the vibes down, but I'm kinda sad, you guys. Gonna put a TLDR but also need to vent a little bit. I'm starting to feel the impact and hurt of people's cruelty. I'm sick of hearing autism used as a punchline, but don't see it ending soon. How to deflect? Detach? 

Getting diagnosed has been one of the best things to happen to me. It was scary at first- I felt solidified as ""different"" and was, you know, shocked. For many reasons, but also because I'd heard people be mean about it. I was terrified to be vulnerable to that. 

Since diagnosis, the more I learn about autism and our community(ies?), the more I love myself. I feel proud to be autistic. I genuinely love who I am. I love my friends on the spectrum. We are some of the funniest, most compassionate, sweetest, genuine, and brilliant people. However, NTs are SO unkind to us. It comes up even in my ""safe"" spaces. 

One of my older autistic friends has been helping me process my diagnosis. He had shared his experience getting bullied with me before, as we often talk about autism. When he explained the phenomenological compound of being ridiculed, bullied, demeaned, etc. his entire life (he didn't get diagnosed until his late 20s either, he's in his 40s now) and the internal defenses resulting from that, I understood objectively and sympathized, but didn't ""feel"" it entirely. 

Now I see it everywhere, even when I try not to look. It's all online so taking a break from the internet seems apt. That's not a permanent solution though and I don't see people stopping. My instinct has been to shut my feelings down and ""stop being dramatic"" and ""sensitive"" about this, but that instinct seems to be another ill-effect of this bullshit. 

TLDR: people are mean. It's getting to me. How to not feel this way?",1
"If you have ADHD, does it cancel out some problems faced by most aspies? I myself have no problem with a change to routine. Well, the ADHD keeps me from developing routines anyway, but if there's a change in the weekly TV lineup or the job routine is messed up then I don't freak out the way some on the spectrum do.

Also, I think I'm able to mask a little better than most aspies. Talking to girls isn't a problem with me (thanks red pill) but I do feel that once I make the connection, I have a harder time at maintaining it than other aspies that can make connections.

They're going through a lot right now, and I want to be there for them, but I don't have the experience to fully understand what they're going through, and I don't know what to say or do (especially since it's a long-distance friendship) in order to be there for them.

We're all very excited about tonight, we're having dinner in a fancy restaurant and after that we're going to the club, I even composed some sort of ironic rap-poetry that sums up the members and the spirit of the group, we're all dressing ourselves up. But for some reason, while scrolling YouTube at home, a sad song comes up to my mind, and within five minutes I feel depressed, sad and empty, and I can't understand why.

Did this ever happened to you? How did you deal with it?",1
"Unsolicited advice fast tracks social alienation; empathize instead. Neurotypicals do this too but it seems to be far more pervasive among aspies. I'm talking about giving unsolicited advice.

* Have you ever vented to someone? Why did you vent? What were you hoping to receive by venting?
* Have you ever shared with someone something great that happened to you? Why and what did you hope to receive?

If you are looking for advice, chances are that you communicate that: ""What do you think about X?"" ""What would you do in X situation?"" ""Why do you think X happened?""

Giving unsolicited advice isn't always upsetting. But why gamble when you can simply ask if you can offer advice? ""Can I offer a suggestion?"" ""Can I offer my perspective?""

The gamble, however, may be worth taking if it's important enough to intervene, e.g., someone is about to seriously harm oneself. Understanding people understand that the gamble is worth it in those instances and may even appreciate it the intervention because the intervention demonstrates care and good judgment.

But in unimportant instances, unsolicited advice often undermines rapport. *This is because when people vent or share, they are looking to build connections, not to solicit advice.* In fact, it is often the case that they already know what to do; they just want to socialize by building connections. When you give unsolicited advice in these instances, you convey that you're not understanding them on a deep, fundamental level while also implying that they are inadequate.

This is why unsolicited advice fast tracks social alienation.

Instead of unsolicited advice, just empathize: ""No way! That's terrible."" ""That's fantastic news!"" ""Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.""

Empathizing may feel awkward at first but over time, you'll replace the habit of giving unsolicited advice with empathy, and you'll come to enjoy empathy because you'll come to enjoy building connections with people.

"DAE feel guilty and/or bad after socializing too much? How to deal with it? Does anyone else feel something like guilty and bad for no particular reason after socializing too much (defining ""too much"" as ""more than you feel like doing in a single day"")?

It is like when you are afraid you have made some big mistakes while talking (so big that other people have understood something different from what you were trying to communicate) but, as no one can read other's mind, neither you nor the other person you talked with knows it.

This happens usually while in bed waiting to get asleep but sometimes also randomly during the day, during and after social interactions.

When these feelings start, in my head the path is always the same: ""Did I say this correctly?"", ""Did he understood what I mean?"", ""Maybe I didn't understood what she said"" and so on, up until ""Please I want to explode, I can't stand all of this anymore"".

Do you have any suggestion on how to deal with this?",1
"is freedom truly real? Ideology of freedom

I see alot of aspies wanting freedom so i ponder and this is the cause

Im also working on my literature so maybe i will write books in my basement one day Heh heh

""Imo"" You Cant have freedom in a society 
Because of manipulation 



Even people that are free can be manipulated into a choice Even under the guise of their own free will. That is because they also desire that choice, but they realise that isnt freedom. so they go with a different choice... And now theres a dilemma 

Its not truly freedom is it? Its more of a form of control yes you have the freedom to choose but you were suppressed into that choice because of a sense of oppression so is your freedom truly free? lt's not what you desired. 

So i guess theres another point i have to make..

Is happiness more important than ""freedom""
And can they coexist?

To portray freedom more accurately im going to tell a story of a man 

With that choice made from above he was happy ""he"" found love with love comes motivation and motivation brings dedication. Yet he felt something missing and so he ponder for a while and eventually he came to a conclusion. That a cage no matter how shiny and prosperous it's still nothing but a cage. You may find everything in that cage that brings you happiness and you could probably survival longer in the cage than outside. but unfortunately humans are creatures tempted by greed there will always want more and MORE  ""what's outside the cage he ponder "" yet human are rationally and intelligent and will weigh the con against the pros.. Yet this human was satisfied so he dares not risk his life

 well untill his lover died it was quite unfortunate and he was depressed, but oh well. he lost his happiness and one day he looked out the cage than more days pass then it happened he stepped out due to curiosity . But He found nothing... everything was gone and nothing existed.


This human couldnt have both because of obvious choices 

1. He lived in a cage 
2. He didnt make steps into trying to be free earlier than he did because being happy is more important than being free for the *majority* 
3. He was weak 

Another etc story 

I am weak so i cant be free i can be framed for crimes i havent done... But because im unimportant the government could deem me as an invaluable asset and use me as a scapegoat. I have no dignity and reputation as im a poor man with no family and my friends were payedoff and that i was framed 

Can you say for certain that every action of yours wasnt under a form of manipulation


Do u see you cant be free in a society of humans unless

1.  you have superpowers to go against the world

 2. you live in complete human isolation

"Does anyone else on the spectrum find it impossible to find a job that fits them? How many jobs have you been through? I was diagnosed in my mid 20's and now am mid 30's so a decade of being in therapy and still cant find stuff and go back to retail.

Job A was in a retail store produce department and I hated people tearing up the displays after I worked hard facing them. I couldnt stand people talking to me other than coworkers. 

Job B was retail bakery. I loved the bakery even after having to give up sugar for my diet. Loved the wrap and talking to people at the table working on the racks of wrap. I hated customers coming up and interrupting us. I hated having to pick up the phone. The only customer I liked was this regular guy who picked up a bread order the only customer I connected with. I couldn't stand being interrupted by customers constantly and the karens who lied about ordering a cake and when we didnt have it they wanted a free cake or a discount.

Job C pizza place. Despite not having customers I hated it. Making pizzas. Having to stand around and wait for the new orders to come in. Because it was Dominos the menu was so big I could never understand it.

Job D telemarketing. I felt like a scumbag because it targeted old people. I remember calling up an old guy during the March madness basketball tournament and he was furious that I interrupted him watching the game. 

Job E. Retail deli. I hated rotisserie chickens because you'd get chicken blood all over you. You had to scrub countless skewers by hand and the room with the ovens was greasy and slippery. The ovens were hot and to make matters worse customers stare at you when you get the chickens out of the oven.

Job F. Chipotle. Manager hired me and threw me on the dishwasher and underpaid me. I lasted 2 days. I told him I wanted to learn how to cook professionally and didnt like dishwashing he didnt care so I bailed.

Job G: Retail meat department. My manager there promised me the moon and the stars. It was the highest paying job I ever had at $17 an hour. But he lied about the hours. I only got 24 hours a week when I was supposed to be full time. It was a service case which meant trays with dividers you had to spend forever washing. Customers would come up and you had to constantly weigh their meats and wrap them in butcher paper and label them. As a result you were stuck behind a counter your entire shift which drove me crazy. I quit due to the lack of hours. 

Job H. Starbucks. Was a very fun job but they only give you 5 and a half hour shift a day and you are capped at 25 hours a week. Also the shift leads kept me on register and I only really felt comfortable on bar. Couldnt stand standing for hours in one place and constantly talking to an endless line of customers.",1

"Do you struggle with bullying, because you don't know your being bullied? Serious question, how can you tell if you're being bullied? I keep facing disrespect by people but my first instinct is to think ""oh it's because I'm anti-social/awkward"" but I can't tell when it's fair or not. I was made fun a lot by ""friends"" so I'm used to it, I was an easy target. I don't seem to pick up on social hierarchy very well. It's just so lonely the amount of rejection I face from peers and I can't tell if I'm being unfairly treated or is it fair to say I'm at fault? 

For context I had a coworker make fun of me on social media for being awkward. I shut down in situations like this and I don't know how to tell people to fuck off or even gain respectability. Is this a sign of autism? I don't understand social shit at all, I've been manipulated and taken advantage of so at this point my own life has become one giant cope. I've had shit spoken to me in person, and I physically mentally etc can't speak back to them or understand their intentions? It's all blank to me. I'll respond bluntly or not no what to say. 

&#x200B;

What I guess I'm asking for is advice on assertiveness or how you deal with disrespect from an autistic POV. Do you literally just have to cope? It's really hard for me to fight back unless it's physical, in which case I've surprisingly been able to come out on top. Verbally I am vulnerable.",1
"Boyfriends abusive behaviour a result of ASD? So my boyfriend was diagnosed with Asperger’s roughly around 2 years ago. We met roughly around a year ago and the topic of his autism is something that has caused issues in our relationship.

He did disclose that he was Autistic prior to us becoming serious because he wanted me to know what I was “getting myself into” which I thought was odd but didn’t bother me whatsoever because I didn’t see why that would stop me from loving him as a person. 

Anyways to get to the main point. He has a tendency of getting what I would call verbally abusive whenever I do something to upset him unintentionally or if he feels unheard by me. It first starts with him breaking up with me and then changing his mind the next day saying he was just upset. He tends to have what he calls manic episodes where he threatens to expose me to my family members or call me degrading names. Again he says that this change in his mood and anger towards me comes from a deep feeling of being hurt by something I’ve done and he says it’s the only way he can communicate his feelings due to him being autistic. At first I’ve dismissed his claims saying that it was unfair for him to say that saying  nasty things to me was a direct correlation of his autism. But I do want to know if it may be. 

It’s caused a strain in our relationship as I tend to get very upset with the things he has said to me and isolate myself from him for a while to calm down for a day or two which only escalates the situation. When I get upset he often is apologetic for what he has says and tells me that I should have taken him more seriously when he told me about his diagnosis and that he doesn’t mean what he says he just has impulsive thoughts.",1

"When you listen to someone talk about their experiences and feelings, do you just ""hear words"" or feel with them and imagine their perspective? So I was just watching a Vice panel on masculinity. I'm a woman and I got a slight instrospective observation abt myself. I was listening to this man talk about how he feels scared to do certain things cus he will be seen as less of a man. I suddenly realised that all I'm registering this as is words, like I'm not trying to imagine anything(except visuals), I don't feel much empathy even, like I'm just hearing words and if I was to explain to someone this man's experience, I would just be repeating his words without understanding how that feels and I would kind of logically know it sucks and i would act accordingly so say like ""it must suck to live that way""

I CAN understand by consciously using effort to ""live a moment"" like that in my head and trying to imagine what that feels like. But it requires effort. Is this smthn u have as well? Also if someone explained smthn terrible to me like their dog died or mom or smthn, I would only hear the words and ""know"" to say oh im sorry etc. But then if i really consciously imagine and use effort, I can give more of an emotional reaponse with empathy etc. So it takes extra effort. Idk if for ppl it's automatic to have empathy based on someone's words. Thoughts?",1

"Rejected because ASD isn't diversity Has anyone else ever experienced being rejected because of your Autism?

Specifically, I'm talking about jobs, careers, or artistic endeavours.

For instance, I run an improv / sketch comedy troupe with other autistic people. I recently applied to be part of an improv festival this coming summer. 

I reached out to this organization during COVID while they weren't even operating.
They open back up this year. They emailed me over a year ago telling me they'd let me know when they were going to start up again. 

Fast forward... The day they posted the event they also emailed me. I paid the fees to apply to be part of the festival and submitted the application the same day. 

I got a message a couple weeks ago that they had rejected us. They claimed that diversity is important to them and they want to represent underrepresented groups. 

I responded (partly out of emotion) that we've been a largely female group (most of our cast is female), and we're all Neurodiverse. 

The didn't care.
I've experienced the same thing with job opportunities. 
Many NTs don't include us in their vision of inclusivity, despite being severely underrepresented. 

They expect to see a wheelchair, physical disability, or some other physically visible trait. 

It's frustrating and heartbreaking having to explain ourselves to ""normal"" people all the time.",1

"Adult in a child's body, but then a child in adult's body When I was a kid, I was told I act older and more mature than my peers, I had more ""adult"" viewpoints on life, I loved talking to people older than me like my teachers, etc. But now that I'm an adult, I do everything opposite: I'm told I have a childish outlook on the world, I enjoy everything that's labeled ""for kids"" (playgrounds, toys, children's books and tv shows...), and while I don't necessarily like little kids, I'd rather talk with them than my peers. 

My entire life I act ""the wrong age"". I feel like my brain and my body aren't really cooperating. Besides what I mentioned, I'm also more child-like when it comes to my physical being and experiences. Everyone around me has already had their first relationships, formed friendship groups, went on vacation with their friends, started building their life... while I feel like that time still hasn't come for me, like I'm not ""old enough"" for that yet (I'm turning 20 this year). My family thinks I'm very weird and that there must be something wrong with me. They tell me I'm like a grumpy grandma and that there's no youth in me, but I feel the opposite?

Another thing that adds to my child-like personality is discomfort with my physical body. Everyone physically develops by the time they leave their teens, they become comfortable with their sexuality, sex (as in what's between your legs), everything sexual in general, while I'm still squeamish about it and very uncomfortable with such topics (if they're ""about"" me). I'm also not particularly interested in my gender. I know I'm biologically a girl, but that's all. To me that's just a fact, nothing more. I could care less if someone refers to me as a boy, he, she, they, it just doesn't matter to me, like my brain can't process that there's a difference between those things.

Could these things have something to do with autism? Does anybody else feel like this? I haven't been diagnosed yet, I'm searching for good doctors right now, but I would love to know if these things could have more meaning.",1
"Overreading Social Cues So I basically discovered that I have asperger's and it explains a lot of things about myself. But one thing which I found very interesting is that for most people with Asperger's, they lack the ability to read social cues. When I was younger I was like that but I've noticed that the opposite has happened now; I read social cues a lot, usually being able to tell people's emotions or certain facts/traits about them just from small things they say or how they act, even a lot more than neurotypical people. That being said, I've also noticed that sometimes I read so much that I make grand conclusions/assumptions about people that are often not true or are a lot simpler than I make out to be. Has anyone else had this trait and is it still an asperger's thing or is it a general trait of those on the autism spectrum?",1
"input from others who had a similar experience would be greatly appreciated. Hey guys, I have a bit of a weird problem and I am unsure what is happening. I will say I am not fully up to date on how Asperger's/asd affects me but I'll just get into it.

I recently broke up with my ex two weeks ago. I was very unhappy in the relationship and it felt like the right time to do it. Since then I have been going through a bit of an upset mentally. I think it's stress? But I am not feeling more stressed than usual if that makes sense. I have been having a bout of insomnia, a few panic attacks, pains in my chest, eczema all over the back of my hands, general mental instability.

I have noticed some of my aspie traits flaring up too, such as having a harder time than normal when reading people and feeling like the don't like me. 

I'll have a good day and then the next day I'm down, it's been like that since I broke up. I moved into a new place on the day too. It's been a lot of big changes recently. I thought I would be fine with it all but I can't help feeling that it's affecting me.

I am happy that I am out of the relationship, for instance I have stopped picking my skin and got back into exercise.

I know there are some out there who struggle to know how they feel, I am unsure if that's an accurate depiction of the problem/condition. I used to be ok at it but for the last two weeks I feel almost disconnected with myself.

I will get over it over time, it's just been a bit hard. If anyone has any inputs or advice I am all ears.",1
"Something weird and funny happened to me because of my ASD For context: I like trains. 

I was waiting for the bus and sat down on a bench near the bus stop. I was texting with my boyfriend and he asked me if I wanted to visit the apartment we like (we're moving) and suggested to go there by TRAIN. I got so excited I jumped up and paced right up to the bus stop only to realize there's no bus coming. I just got too excited too suddenly that I couldn't contain myself and my brain turned on the autopilot and loaded some kind of reaction that's roughly appropriate. Then I walked back to the bench and sat down again and told my BF what I'd just done. I think we both had a good laugh.",1

"One reason why the English language is bad for Aspies Maybe you've been in this scenario. Someone asks you ""Please get the 6 inch, red, Craftsman Phillips-head screwdriver."" That's a noun with 4 adjectives on it, but what's worse is that you don't even know they're asking of you until you get to the noun, which is at the end of the sentence! This is the way how English is, we put our adjectives before our nouns. In other languages they do it differently. In Hebrew for instance they'd say ""Please get the screwdriver 6 inch, red, Craftsman, Phillips-head."" They tell you what it is you should be looking for, & then specify it. Meanwhile in English, you're just trying to hold on to all these adjectives in your head until they finally get around to the noun so you know what the heck they want. 

This means that in instances like this the English language isn't a good fit for people with poor Working Memory scores, which is common for people on the spectrum. You can tell if you have a poor working memory by taking the WAIS-IV, and you take the WAIS-IV by going to your state government's Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, where I got mine taken for free.",1
"I hate that I always fuck up every chance at having a friend/partner I've always been lonely. I think that because of my autism, I just don't care about anything that is not my hyperfixation. In fact, I think that's the only reason I'm still alive.


Also because of my autism, I just don't know how to behave. I always act very weird and like a creep (people have confirmed it). It's just a matter of time until people see that I am way too obsessed over something or that I said something mean without realizing it, and they stop talking to me. I just think a relationship without common interests is doomed to fail.


So, a couple of weeks ago, I met another autistic girl at therapy, and we met. I thought I had found ""the one"". We texted each other everyday and I think we both got our expectations a little too high. It was just a matter of time until that bubble exploded. I just didn't know how to talk about her interests. I don't share them. 


We also ended up debating about politics and that didn't turn out well. She barely sees my texts now, and I don't blame her. I really feel guilty as fuck, but I think I damaged the relationship permanently. 

Does anyone else experience the same? I feel like I'm doomed to die alone now. It is just way too hard to find anyone with my niche interests, and I have no real life job. It's impossible for me to meet people in real life.",1
"How do you guys make friends online? Please excuse the ridiculous question, but I’m ready to branch out a bit. I’m WFH and an online student, and my girlfriend is halfway around the world on a semester abroad, thus I spent the vast majority of my time alone with my cat. I don’t mind being alone whatsoever, but I find myself wishing I had more people to converse with about which I’m passionate. I just don’t really know where to begin.

I love gaming, and I spend roughly 12 hours a day online in some form or another. It seems the obvious choice, but after being alone for a while, I’ve felt many of my social skills rust at a minimum, if not completely disappear. I’ve been playing mostly single-player games, but I’d happily take suggestions. I think I’d enjoy having a buddy to game with. 

I suppose I don’t really know where to look, and I need to find a good way to initiate. Does anyone have some advice?",1
"What does autism feel like in social settings? I am considering whether I might be autistic. 
I have a constant terror of saying something that for some reason is considered ""weird"".

I am not myself with others as I feel my spontaneous self would be misinterpreted. I have noticed recently that probably my face would not be very expressive if I did not subconsciously prompt myself to express myself on that level.

I am also terrified of saying things ""the wrong way"", like with a weird phrasing, which I think I do quite often.

I hate faking and not saying things directly, but I feel like I have no choice but ""translate"" my direct sentences into embellished indirect ones otherwise people would get offended (this has not happened though. Is it because I fake well?)

On the other hand, I am very good at reading people, and I can read through the lines quite easily although I would love a world where I can take people's statements at face value. 

I am also gifted and traumatized from abuse and bullying. But I feel like there might be more because my panic with social norms and appearing wrong /weird is just...extreme.

It's like I am quite aware of social norms I just hate following them and I have to suppress my whole being to do that.

"Anyone struggle caring for others’ interests/hobbies? So I’ve recently started therapy and found out a few things about myself. One being that I absolutely have no investment in others hobbies or interests. For example, I could talk about my favourite movie or song to someone, then when they respond with a movie they like that I’ve never heard or a song I haven’t listened to, I will then lie and pretend I’ve seen said movie or heard said song so they stop talking about it.

"not sure what to do at this point in my life 
Hi. This is going to be a long read, so I understand if no one wants to read it. I just need to talk about everything.

I am not diagnosed. I know that here, self diagnosis is accepted, but I still feel awful feeling this way without a proper diagnosis. I have heard it is very difficult to be diagnosed due to issues with actually speaking to a professional, and how sometimes autism gets dismissed for something else, or just ignored. I have an autistic friend who swears that I am, and she has known me since I was a young teen, now almost 20yo. She got me to take the assessments she took, and she is formally diagnosed, and I scored above the maximum requirement for each assessment. Its just the fact Ive been dismissed as being “stubborn” or “misbehaved” my whole life, like I have been gaslit this whole time, that I don’t know what to do or what to think. I’ve never been a bad kid, I was a straight A student, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t struggle to keep up my entire life, especially socially.

I have severe social anxiety, separation anxiety, and sensory issues. I cannot talk on the phone, I cannot keep a job, I cannot order for myself at restaurants, I can’t even make an appointment for myself if I needed to. If I had to call 911 if I was in a dangerous situation, I don’t know if I could. I can’t even handle speaking in person to my own family, it is so hard for me. I get sweaty and nervous just sending a simple text to anyone. I don’t go anywhere alone. I barely even go to the bathroom by myself. I never shower by myself, I don’t sleep by myself, I won’t eat unless someone else is eating, etc. I try to sleep while my boyfriend is at work so that I am not trapped in my own mind. 

Sensory issues are another major issue I have. I change clothes multiple times a day, especially socks. I will not touch my floor without socks. I can’t stand wearing my hair certain ways or even tucking it behind my ear frustrates me. I can’t stand loud noises. I cover my ears around trains or speakers. I keep vibrations and sound haptics disabled on my phone because they scare me. I don’t like flashing lights and certain colors make my head hurt. I constantly twist and pop my ankles/wrists so much that it hurts, but I can’t help it. I don’t like touching people and I don’t like them touching me, I always refuse hugs and handshakes, and people just think I am mean, but I just can’t do it. I only wear the same old clothing as I always do because anything new or uncomfortable frustrates me. I can’t handle heat. Being slightly sweaty makes me want to just sit in the shower in cry.

Currently, I want a diagnosis. The problem with this, is that I can’t do it myself, and I am too afraid to even tell my parents how I feel about this. They are close minded, and I know if I told them how I thought I was autistic, that I would be met with blank stares and would be gaslit like I always have been. I want their help, but I can’t even talk to them. They won’t accept it. They would tell me I am too smart for what I am saying to be true.. but, thats not how it works at all. They don’t even believe that I have allergies when I told them.

I am happy to have my current S/O, they help me get through a lot of these things and they are acceptant of my self diagnosis, and they encourage me to just be myself. But am I the only one who desires a real diagnosis? I know something is wrong. I can’t even take care of myself. I could quite literally not be independent and fend for myself it I needed to.

The last thing I am confused about is why? Why didn’t my parents think anything was abnormal? I walk on my tip toes. I have clear issues with how materials felt. I didn’t have friends. I clearly have an eating disorder, and I even verbally told them this. Why did they dismiss all of it? And could this be why I am so doubtful of myself? 

I don’t know. Thanks to anyone who actually read all of this. There is so much more I actually want to say. I don’t know what to do at this point in my life. The way I live my day to day life is a struggle and it hinders me from being a person, or at least that is how I feel.

edit: i left out a whole part of why i feel this way, mainly my anxiety. i am SO confused when I try to talk to people. i feel like anytime i talk that the things i say get taken out of context and people get offended or whatever because they think im being rude, when there was no hidden meanings behind what i said.

i dont get jokes. i cant tell when someone is being sarcastic, and this usually results into me apologizing for not understanding and just being quiet. i feel like i have to walk on eggshells when i talk in fear of upsetting someone and i always recite the things i say in my head before the conversation actually happens, in fear of messing up. its just simply because i don’t understand what people are thinking or what they are thinking when they look at me a certain way. i cant seem to understand how they feel about things and i cant express to them how i feel about something either.",1

"I find myself socially irritable and not sure where to go with this I think having hypervigilance and social issues has caught up to me in a way where I don't like being around people very much.

I think maybe I just need to do more of these and overtime I'll get used to it again? There were times when I was younger where I had a lot of friends. Maybe after a handful of annoying experiences, I'll grow to like it again? What do you think?",1
"Will my mom always love me? I have been going to therapy and learned a lot of my self-esteem issues derive from the interactions with my mom when I was living at home. Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post to either.

When I was 10, I told my cousin that my brothers didn’t like her mother. My cousin got upset and my mom then told me every day for months that I did a horrible thing and we couldn’t see our cousins ever again because of what I said. I didn’t think I did anything wrong at the time.

When I was 15, I won my first wrestling match. I told my mom and she asked “was your opponent actually trying?”

Whenever I started new jobs and she asked how it was going and I said I was doing well she would ask “in real life?”

My therapist recommended I discuss with my mom how some of what she did affected my self esteem but I’m really nervous to discuss it with my mom.

I’m scared my mom will get mad at me and not want anything to do with me.

"I Delt with a Tricky Situation Successfully! **Short Story;**

I went to get something through ""Click & Collect"" and it went poorly. I still managed to get the whole thing done!

**Full Story;**

I made my way up after getting the notification that my products were ready. This was an odd start with getting three separate emails and messages for the individual products and not the whole order but that is not as much an issue as the rest. I clicked on the ""I'm on my way"" option on each email and went ahead to go to the store. It was prompt preparing everything to that point which was nice to see.

I made my way to the Click & Collect parking at the Tallaght store and opened the emails and clicked ""I'm here"" and requested the delivery to car option at around 11:00. I put in my mobile number and car registration as requested, the additional details were not needed as I was the only person in those spots. After waiting around a half an hour, I figured I made a mistake and was meant to leave the page open on one product that said I would be dealt with shortly. ""My mistake"", I thought, I had not used this before so that is ok. Having one email only would have made it more clear though.

Unfortunately, it got to the one hour mark waiting. I was confused to say the least so was debating heading into the store but there were a few issues:

* What if I miss the person bringing the items out and then the order is cancelled.
* I had not prepared myself to go in the store.
* What if I made a mistake in the process and now I'll be interfering with things.
* I'll probably annoy the staff and they don't need more work.

To me, this was a rather large predicament I found myself in, but I decided I would go in the store because I must have made a mistake in how the process worked.

I went back to the email and chose to collect in store and followed the instructions to go to the collection desk. There was, however, a queue. This is not something they can really control on who is there, so it was ok. I waited in the line for some time but the customers at the desk were rather argumentative so it was clear it would take some time. A member of the floor staff did come over to check on everyone in the line to see if he was able to help and although he was not able to help anyone at this time I was still appreciative that he came to check on us all.

Some more time was spent in the queue and a member of the staff came out from behind the desk to see if anyone can be helped more quickly. He informed me that I can get my order by talking to ""that man"" who he pointed out. I thanked the man and went over to the other staff member.

He did seem busy though but that was who I was told to talk to. I did manage to get his attention, but he seemed rather bothered by the interaction and just told me to go “over there” to the TV section to “him”. Now, this staff member did seem busy or in a rush, but he was rather abrupt and not as polite as the other two staff.

By now, I was beginning to feel sick and shaky because I was getting incredibly stressed by the whole situation, but I made my way over to the other staff member. He was dealing with a customer, so I waited. After some time, he did come over to check on me, I am not sure if he was done with the other customer or had some time, either way I was glad he took the time to help.

He asked me how he could help, and I gave the order number, and he told me to go out and take two right turns and they can help you. This man was genuinely nice and helpful, but it did little to ease the stress at this point.

So, I made my way to the car and had to sit there for a bit to gather myself together and settle down. I had debated calling my mam to essentially help ease my mind and the situation but she was out to the cinema for a day out, so I did not want to ruin her day.

I made my way over to the collection place suggested by the staff member in the store and the two ladies that were there were exceptionally kind and helpful so that was helpful in easing my mind.

Still, I got what I ordered and made it back home. Not going to lie though, it had me rather unsettled for some time as I settled my mind.

There was a driver too on the way up that was not helpful for setting the stage for this whole situation.",1

"Dealing with anxiety around doing something wrong Prefacing this with the disclaimer that I am seeing a therapist about this, but I was just curious if anyone else experiences something similar and knows a way to deal with it.

I deal with a lot of anxiety around doing something wrong unintentionally. It tends to become a major problem when someone I’m close to changes their behavior in some way.  For example, if a roommate starts to avoid common areas and doesn’t respond the same way they normally do when I try to talk to them, I become TOTALLY convinced that they hate me. I’ll start to isolate myself and avoid the person because I think they don’t want to be around me.

This becomes a huge issue when I do actually do something wrong. Because I get SO worked up about the possibility, I tend to have an emotional reaction if they do actually bring up an issue. It’s really embarrassing. I just want to have a normal conversation where I take responsibility and apologize, but I just start crying in the middle of the conversation. (This only happens if I’m already anxious, if the person brings it up when I’m calm it’s totally fine and I can be mature about it lol) This makes the person uncomfortable, and they stop telling me when I do something wrong because of it.

I don’t know how to stop this from happening. I’m really struggling to use normal anxiety-based coping skills because often it IS fact-based and they ARE actually upset for some reason. I would really appreciate any advice on this if you experience something similar.",1

I don’t know. Sorry, I guess I’m just publicly venting.",1
"Do anyone of you feel like you grew up improperly due Asperger’s/autism? Looking at things through hindsight and seeing how I compare to others of my age…I’ve aged terribly and with some awkward aspects basically feel like I’m a guy of his generation who’s lost in time.
I wear basic clothes(far too often a black t-shirt and jeans), I don’t do my hair that great(it’s a sh***y improvised fohawkish hair thing that only raises the front hairs and it looks bad,especially when I have apparently an oversized forehead, but it’s stuck up because I look really ugly and have no other hair alternatives). Though Asperger’s or not there’s one factor that makes it hard for me fit in and look normal and that is since my teens my face turned weird and looks especially ugly, dirty, and in recent days creepy(even when I wear a mask just my eyes alone look weird). I tried everything look like cleansin my face 24/7 and being out in the sun and still nothing. i can't even wear hats or hoods without looking strange in them.
I feel weak and awkward when I’m walking in public compared to my non-autistic brother in where my hands want to fidget and I can’t put my hands in my pockets for warmth without it looking weird.
Even my voice sounds nasally and weak that it makes it discouraging to speak up cause it too sounds weird.
And I often have a hard time what adults of my generation do these days in getting caught up(shows,memes, hanging out). I was a bit more used to being a kid than an adult. Autism really disrupts the growing up process which is serious. And my parents have been too clueless(like no wonder I have autism..sorry I just had frustrating times with them lately. They don’t try to listen to the rules and facts they’re people who improvise and fantasize over things) to help, I’m on my own to realize the better.
I also would regret not doing varsity soccer or any sports even if I already look weird to supposedly better stimulate growth of my body with playful outside exercising. I’m now really thinking of just how many of my peers did stuff like that too.",1
"I get extremely stressed when asked if I want to do something. I need time to digest it and I also need to know all the details. How can this be described to someone simply? I suppose the title is simple enough but I know there’s terms for things or further literature. I don’t know what you would call this issue? I need help explaining this to someone. 

This happens to me a lot. I’m asked if I want to do something. The truth is I never want to do *anything* but once I digest the idea of an activity I sometimes would like to do it. Only if it’s family, if not it might not be something I’d want to do. I feel like this is not understood about me and I tried saying “I will get back to you” but then I made it worse by saying the truth. The truth that I don’t want to do anything and that I can’t decide how I’ll feel about x, y, z since it’s so far away. Then the idea is scrapped and it makes me feel bad. The bottom line is I just need time to process it but it never happens this way. 

I notice a lot of the time I get immediately anxious and it just never goes right. I get anxious and I get agitated and I get annoyed when I’m asked if I want to do something out of the ordinary. But it also depends on what it is. Some things are in the realm of stuff that is not out of the ordinary for me to be asked. My issue is when I’m asked if I want to do something that is so out of the ordinary, like if I want to go on a trip or an outing that has never been broached in the past. 

Is there any literature about this? I’ve read this many times but I’m having trouble finding a good article. I don’t know if this is just about decision making. I just feel like I need to understand it a little better for me to explain it better because this sort of thing comes up in my life maybe once a year maybe twice.",1

"Questions to aspies from a potential aspie Hello. Tomorrow, I'm actually going to the doctor for a referral to someone who can test me for asperger's, or, autism spectrum disorder, as it's called in my country. I know that it's looked down-upon to claim to be autistic without a diagnosis, and rightfully-so, so before I ask some questions, I want to clarify that I could very well not have asperger's. However, since my mother first suggested I get tested, I've been reading about this and it's really interested me, so I have some questions.

\-**Do you guys tend to actually struggle with anger and being too assertive?** Most aspies I've seen in media are either portrayed as completely-withdrawn or very people-pleasing and socially-awkward. Personally, I am definitely very introverted, aloof and have what others call ""a resting bitch face,"" but I rarely struggle with shyness. I am very stubborn on doing what makes sense to me and value honesty, even if it hurts. Part of why my mother's getting me tested is because the combination of me being socially-oblivious, caring little of what others think, and being very stubborn, has actually turned me into something of a problem child (of course I'd manage to accomplish that without even boys or partying...).

I try to compensate for my social-awkwardness by actually being loud. If I'm talkative and blunt and make edgy jokes, then people tend to think I'm funny. When I was a kid, I become loud, obnoxious, and ""lUl RaNdOm,"" the class clown, because if I couldn't get people laughing with me, at least people could laugh at me, and they'd still want to stick around. To this day, when people laugh, I immediately get a huge dopamine boost, even if they're not really laughing for a good reason. And so, when I'm not drooling and staring off into the clouds, I argue, I intimidate, I laugh, and at least when people stare at me in shock, it was out of something intentional. I am in control of it (and I can get my inner nerd out and go ""AKSHULLY"" on Reddit).

Ok, that was a novel, sorry. My question is, have some of you guys compensated for your social struggles by becoming more assertive?

\-it seems to be a common sentiment among asperger's communities, that when you're a child you feel like an adult, and when you're an adult you feel like a child. I relate to this immensely. **I was wondering, though, if you guys can pinpoint the age at which you started feeling more like a kid than an adult?** For me, I think it happened at age twelve. It's strange, because my beliefs were very different when I was twelve, but I think it was at that age that my preferred thinking process really solidified. I dunno. Either way, I feel like twelve-year-old me in my sixteen-year-old body, just, even more tired.

**-do you guys tend to think you're pretty okay at socializing in the present moment, but then you look back on your past and always seem to say ""wow, I was pretty awkward for my age?""** Because of my aforementioned compensation of feigning extroversion, I used to think I was more socially-skilled than others, just because I talked more and others took my bluntness for humor. Also, it's generally just hard for me to tell when I screw up, socially. Only a few months ago, it genuinely did not occur to me that I should not say that my friend looks like a rat - only recently did I remember that and desperately apologize to her. And it's the same thing every time I look back - just layers of shit that should have been obviously-taboo but that I didn't get. What's even scarier, is that I'm probably just scratching the surface of my ineptitude.

**Also, do you guys have any tips for how I can notice my social mishaps in the present moment?** On one hand, I want to be better, but on the other hand, I don't want to become a stuttering wimp. I've been wondering how I can learn to better-intuit what's socially-acceptable, because experience is one long degree to earn. I've tried reading books on socialization, manipulation, body language, the works, but when I actually try to put any methods into practice, it's all too much for me to process.

\-**do you guys know if it's possible to ""select"" special interests?** I swear to God I only obsess over the stupidest shit. It's often fandoms - I become invested in one, spend 50% of my time obsessively daydreaming stories about it, repeat for months or years, run out of story material, then move on to the next interesting story. Or, I randomly become infatuated with something dumb, like tsunamis, and follow that interest to the ends of the Earth. When I was a kid, I used to info-dump constantly about tsunamis, my favorite book series, and nutritionism. I feel so bad for the polite adults I yapped to for hours on end. As I got older, I've generally learned to not talk about what I'm interested in. Nowadays, I prattle on about gossip and politics like everyone around me.

Anyways, it would definitely be useful if I could control what I have a special interest in. I know this may be a stretch, but if there are any methods or theories, I'd love to hear them.

\-**how do you guys prevent meltdown?** I rarely experience this, but think I may have experienced this recently, at a show. Long story short, it was obnoxiously-loud - even when I plugged my ears, it felt like shrieking in my ear, but everyone around me cheered and had a good time.

It became too much, I started crying and shaking uncontrollably. I begged my mother to let me leave, but she made me stay because she says I need to become accostomed to these situations. Honestly, it was one of the worst experiences of my life.

It's not just these extreme things either - I get overwhelmed so easily. When I inconvenience people, when too many people demand things from me at once, when I have to see PDA, when I have to listen to music I don't like, people slurping soup, high-pitched laughter, dogs whining... sometimes, I burst into tears for what looks to others like no reason. I feel stupid for being so sensitive.

Sometimes, it helps for me to repeat a prayer over and over and over or scream into a pillow, but it draws attention, so I can't usually do that. I try my best to do deep breathing, stare at something, clear my head - hell, I once did that for a whole hour and the anger and overwhelm would rush back no matter what. But I can't always run away from these situations and I feel so helpless. That specific time, I was staring out the window and avoiding eye-contact with others so that they wouldn't see my emotional state. My mother took it as defiance and got angry at me. No one around me seems to understand how horrible it feels. I want to find ways to stop feeling like that, or stop getting overwhelmed in the first place.

I have more questions, but I have just realized that my nonesense rivals Kant's, so I think I'll leave at this. Thanks to anyone who bothers to read, let alone answer, this drivel.",1
"Any advice for helping my ASD son get a blood test done? I've now tried three times at three separate pathology labs to get a blood test my paediatrician ordered almost a year ago now for my 9 year old ASD son. We spent almost 2 hours at the lab today and he came through and sat in the chair four times but he freaked out and started crying and trying to run away each time and of course I'm not going to physically force him to do anything. I couldn't do it anymore so we left after the fourth try. My husband tried the first time and couldn't even get him to go inside the lab. I tried the second time and he bit me so hard I bled (he's not bitten me since he was a toddler).  
  
He's a great, well adjusted little guy I love to bits, but he fixates on his fear of the pain and can't distract himself or use any coping mechanisms we've tried in therapy once he gets into that fearful thought loop. Crazy thing is he's had blood tests before and not had any issues, but he did find getting the COVID vaccines hard so I think it's fear from that experience.  
  
Things we've tried/considered:.  
- watching me go first/talking him through what's happening - he finds this more stressful, he doesn't want to think about what is going to happen.  
- emla patches (numbing medication) - he had those on today and it didn't help with his fear at all despite the phlebotomist showing him his skin was numb multiple times. He is (very reasonably) scared it will hurt one the needle penetrates his numb skin.  
- bring his iPad/current novel he's reading in with him - he can't focus on it enough to get distract him.  
- rewards - he is usually very rewards driven, but this is too big an emotional reaction to see this pay-off logically a worth the fear and possible pain.  
- taking breaks to distract and calm down - obviously this works to help emotionally regulate after each try, but didn't seem to help get him to a different mindset to have a more successful attempt.  
   
Of course having an older woman in the waiting area ask ""is he done or did he walk out?"" after an attempt then come up and show him her band-aid and say ""see, I did it, it's easy"" is sooo helpful too. The staff today were wonderful and we'll try again there, but I really need some thoughts or ideas from people with experience in this situation. It's frustrating not knowing if there's something else (like a vitamin deficiency) going on we could help with and mortifying going to each paediatrician appointment and being asked about if we've done the test and having to say no. Thoughts?  
  
Edit: forgot to add this is a fasting blood test, which of course doesn't help with his resilience as the longer we are there the hungrier more poor little guy gets 😥",1

"Traditional psychotherapy may be may be contra-indicated during autistic burnout Interesting study on the need for treatment to support people in autistic burnout. The research was centered on autistic adult voices/experience.

Of note, it suggests traditional therapy methods (CBT etc.) may do more harm than good for someone in autistic burnout. This aligns with my personal experience.

I had a severe burnout episode 2 years ago with persistent unaliving ideation and I was scared to death. Me, my husband, and my best friend searched EVERYWHERE for professional support/treatment to help me. We had just learned I’m autistic, and we were stunned that the only option available for immediate, intensive treatment was to call 911 and get checked into a regular inpatient facility (a sensory nightmare which would have further exacerbated my condition).

I’m glad there’s finally something in the literature about the need for appropriate support. I feel validated in my decision to fire my psychiatrist and opt-out of any further psychotherapy.

“Our results highlight that routine treatments for depression, such as cognitive behaviour therapy and behavioural activation, may be contra-indicated within autistic burnout, even though these conditions may co-exist. Our experts described the need for withdrawal and downtime for recovery, somewhat antithetic to behavioural activation. With cognitive overload being described as a key precursor of autistic burnout, cognitive-focused therapies could be counterproductive.”

Kawhi Leonard Might Be Autistic🧐 ,1
"""Uncanny Valley"" Hello.

I never felt the ""creeps"" from things that people seem to be disturbed, like clowns, ""realistic"" cartoons, dolls, mannequins or anything that ""looks human"" but it isn't.

I started to think this was linked to autism because of some traits associated with difficulties understanding facial expressions, so, I don't have a parameter of how a human face should or shouldn't act that I can recognize immediately.

When I said I wasn't scared of those things, schoolmates and family just said I was being an edgy teenager, so I started acting scared even if I wasn't at all, just to be accepted, a.k.a. masking.

Has anyone had a similar experience as this? It could possibly be a link between not being scared about those things and autism? What do you think?",1

I was rather recently diagnosed with both autism and ADHD...  It feels really hard to do simple things. It can feel like I have opposite sides/traits that make it difficult to sound/appear coherent. I have topics I can spend lots and lots of time talking about, but then I lose interest in things pretty easily. It's rather hard to keep track of a thought or idea because I have so many different ones competing for a spotlight in my mind. It feels too noisy in my mind. Luckily, in a way, it's not as severe as before because I'm now taking Concerta to help with my ADHD, but still...

Also, I feel like sometimes I get easily over stimulated, but other times, I kinda crave some kind of ""action"" to ""feel"" something like: moving my fingers in a sequenced way or even making some sounds. One of the worst things I feel is that I ""need""/often find myself using a ""mask"" during most social interactions that I need to go through daily. It's a defensive mechanism that is a double-edged sword: on one side, it helps me ""survive"" and do things, but on the other side, it drains my energy so aggressively. It's such a fine line that often can't be maintained.

I've also been taking sertraline and I've been feeling more ""free"" and am starting to gain confidence to truly be myself and not spend so much energy hiding who I am in fact. But at the same time, I question myself: Is it okay for me to *truly* be myself like that? I mean, all of my life I learned through unfortunate ways to hide and ""behave"" and now that I'm feeling better, some may think I'm not like this and I'm just craving for attention etc..

"Is it worth it to disclose to an employer after 2 years? I've worked at a place for 2 years now.
After a few months I got promoted to a supervisor position that involved a lot of paperwork, reports, and managing.

I really struggle with executive functioning, organizational skills, but I was up for the challenge.

It was way too much for me though, and I was fired after a few months.

They've since taken me back doing my original position, and things are going well.

I've never disclosed my Aspergers diagnosis to an employer before, and wish I had so they might have known I struggle with executive functioning skills...but I didn't want to be held back by any possibilities either.

Do you think it's worth it disclose this even a couple years into a job?

What have been your positive or negative experiences with disclosing to an employer?",1
"Do you have 2 levels of consciousness? I have, I don't want to say two personalities, but more two levels of consciousness. How can I explain that? 
Let's assume I'm driving a car and there is another person near me that have already setted my way on Google Maps. 

So I'm going that way, anyway. 

For example, when I was 5 years old I decided to becoming a bank employee. And now, I'm studying for that even if in the years I changed my mind various times. 

I can, somewhat, feel this subconscious personality. 

I know that I'm not the dominant one of this body, I know I'm just a mask. 

I know she is the true me. 
She is somewhat free from bonds, empathy, maternal instinct, pain, happiness, depression. 

I'm like the emotional part of myself, but I'm way younger than her. 

I don't know how to explain that.",1

"Are there any polyamorous people here who feel like being poly is, for them, linked to being autistic? I've been questioning a lot about whether I might be poly but I'm not sure if it's because I'm autistic or because if trauma I've experienced because of it has made me feel like I just can't have the kind of relationship I want with just one person. I just feel like monogamy is so limiting as far as the kinds of relationships I can have and it seems statistically impossible to find someone right for me. I have a lot of special interests and sharing them is really important to me in a relationship and statistically the likelihood of finding someone who finds me attractive, meshes with my personality, and shares my interests seems pretty much impossible. Especially given the fact that I live in a relatively small town. It also seems ludicrous to me to give up being with someone awesome who you love just because they don't meet all your needs but also equally crazy to live my whole life not having a partner to share certain things with. Anyway, just wondered if anyone else feels similarly because I've been thinking about it a lot and feeling kind of ashamed for feeling this way.",1

I don't know what it feels like not to be ""like me"", I thought everyone was meant to be like me. I was told a friend ""I will like to date someone like me"", and she said ""urrrmm,Nope! its not happening because there is nobody like you""…….I am generally described as innocent and sweet.

I took many diagnostics texts online and all the results showed that I have a strong likelihood of autism. Is there any Psychological firm/clinic online that  I can check into for a diagnosis?

"BDSM and neurodivergence Hi! I've been thinking a bit about the intersection of BDSM and nerurodivergence.

until it's too much for the other person and they leave (this has happened a couple of times now). 
i'm convinced i'll never be able to be a ""good"" friend and even people i'm not as close to have told me i need to become more empathetic (this is a weekly occurrence at this point). 

""I don't know if you just ignore how other people feel about things
or if you actually have no idea how i feel."" that was something an old fried said to me. 

i hurt every single person i'm around and i don't even know i'm doing it. i say things i shouldn't i do things i shouldn't i don't how to comfort other people i don't notice when somebody feels hurt. 

I need clear and direct communication, otherwise is just don't notice anything. I believe i have a really bad sense of empathy and i also can't really feel/see stuff from other people's perspective. When someone is noticeably sad or directly says so i know i should feel something but i just don't?? i just feel incredibly awkward because i don't know what to do which in turn makes me feel bad about myself. 

I took an empathy quotient test just out of interest (i know it's just a silly online test) and got a 10 (out of 80 max; 30 is the threshold score) 

However i can empathise with fictional characters, not just any, but i am able to and I have read a few books that made me cry. But i think books make it easier to empathise because you're kinda told what the character is feeling?? 

Right now i have zero close friends which i kinda sad because I want to have friends!! And i'm  trying to become a better person but i feels impossible!!! 
Not to mention that it's also incredibly hard for me to find people that like me, in general.

The only thing that does satisfy me is watching genuine happiness from genuine people because it feels like a good general direction in life.

It’s literally dog shit.

"Can't Stop Resenting My Colleague TLDR AT THE BOTTOM

So, time for a mini rant because I've been holding this in for too long and if I were to do this anywhere else I'd be called an incel by neurotypicals who can't empathize with me.

I (23M) will be 24 in a month and although I'm in a master's program and thinking of doing a PhD, I think these goals will never make up for all of the social and romantic failures in my life caused by my autism. 

To give you context: I was bullied/excluded/rejected/shit on by most people my age growing up even until I was 21 for being too ""different"" from them and never given the chance to integrate with others/ work on the bs ""social skills"" that they covet so much.

Fast forward to today, I may have friends but no true friend group, and even then, a lot of my friends (I don't even know if they're worth that title) are often too ""busy"" to hangout with me. Not to mention the fact that I've employed literally every strategy that others have told me to do such as joining clubs, meetups, dating apps, asking social people for introductions etc yet none of this has worked out for me in helping me get the life I want for myself.

Literally everyone else in my cohort and honestly age bracket has a long-term relationship/is getting married, along with other goals that they inevitably will meet. But even more pertinent to what's been going on, I have this colleague in my cohort who I haven't been able to stop resenting and hating, in particular.

Why do I resent my colleague? Well, here are a few reasons:

1. She's neurotypical (naturally)
2. She's attractive
3. She has a proper social circle, unlike me
4. She's been in a long term relationship since she and her partner were 15.

Basically, she is everything I never got to be in my life, and in a few years time she'll probably be getting married whilst I'll still be single and it'll be too late for me to have any kind of meaningful relationship/married unlike her and the rest of my cohort.

Although she claims she was bullied like I was in school, it probably wasn't as bad as the bullying and negative reinforcement I had to go through in my own life because unlike me, the bullying she went through didn't ruin her life like it did mine. 

And before any of you ask, yes I am in therapy and have been for 8.5 years (currently on my 11th therapist) but none of this stuff has worked out for me. If anything, the ""therapy"" has actually made me even more angry and resentful of everyone around me, especially my colleague. 

This resentment for my colleague has been eating me alive for the past 5 months and I never have truly felt as powerless and hopeless as I have been in my entire life.

TLDR: Colleague has the life I want because she never suffered like I did and I can't stop resenting her for it.",1

Does anybody else get super depressed/stressed or over whelmed the first two days after a full moon? But feel great before and during?

Also I noticed the last few months the stock market did well right before the full moon and was red the couple days after haha. They should have a track the moon trading algorithm to see if there’s any correlation. Even if it’s coincidental. The moon is very fascinating. Fish behavior revolves around the moon and tide and I’m pretty sure our ancestors used to hunt under the light of a full moon.,1
"Does autism make you physically tired? I am asking because I have several other diagnoses and sometimes it is hard to know what is what. The past year I have felt so weak physically. My energy is gone. I have never been very strong or energic, but not this kind of weak either.

"My family is making me feel miserable and I can’t move out I can’t stand being around my family anymore. I’m the only aspie in my family so there’s no one I can really talk to. My mom is the only one who at least somewhat tries to understand me, but she sometimes says and does things that make me question whether she really cares about me. My dad is also nice to me, but I never have any conversations with him that go deeper than small talk. The rest of my family hates me for having Aspergers (which they have said out loud multiple times). They always say how much of a burden I am and that they enjoy it when I’m not around, lash out at me, and are generally passive aggressive towards me. They complain about how weird I am because I never talk. They say that I’m ruining their fun because I can’t handle noise and ask them to be quiet. In the past I had even subconsciously adopted their toxic behavior myself (gossiping, being mean to others in general etc), but over the past few years I’ve started to think for myself and came to the conclusion that I don’t want to be around these people anymore, because they prevent me from being a better version of myself. 

I quit college last year because of all the stress that comes with having to meet social expectations, on top of everything that is happening at home. I feel like if I would have a place for myself where I have privacy and quietness I’d find it much easier to deal with life’s other stresses. As long as I’m still living with my family I don’t see myself going back to college or doing anything else for that matter. I’m still a minor, so I can’t just get my own apartment. I’ll turn 18 in 2 months, but even then it’ll be difficult to move out. The housing market in my country (the Netherlands) has gone through the roof so there’s no way that I can afford anything. I’m extremely desperate at this point and don’t know for how much longer I can handle this. Any advice would go a long way. Thank you for reading.",1
"The fact that relationships are a normal part of life for most people is astonishing I’m 21F and most people my age are either in relationships or sexually active. Flirting comes to them so easily and hookups are the norm. I just don’t understand. I don’t even know how to flirt, not only does it feel unnatural to me but I feel unattractive and insecure, so I’d be way too afraid of rejection. How are people so sure that they won’t be rejected? As for sex, the thought of being that vulnerable with someone you just met makes me uneasy. People are comfortable showing their naked body to a stranger? They’re not afraid of getting made fun of or rejected? They’re not afraid of diseases? They’re not insecure in their abilities? Dating, flirting, sex, relationships, and socialization in general is just a huge mystery to me and the fact that neurotypicals navigate it so easily makes me feel so useless.",1
"I feel like I'm faking it I am currently on the self diagnosis step, soon I'll talk to my psychiatrist about it. But this self discovering situation is very difficult to handle, I have many traits of autistic people, and it influences negatively my life in many ways, but I feel like I'm not ""too autistic"", I feel like if I mask I'm actually lying and I don't have autism. Plus I have a generalized anxiety and depression so many symptoms can be mistaken with autism traits. I don't know myself anymore, I don't enjoy anything, I can't live with this doubt if I'm autistic or not. Maybe I'm just so attached to this supposition because I want to prove that I'm different for a certain reason and that I'm not responsible for the way I am.
Sorry for people who are against self diagnosis, I'm not a fan of it neither but I don't have enough conditions in my country to do a real diagnosis unless there is a miracle.",1
"Please tell me things will get better. I got fired from a job I loved two weeks ago. I went into the details of that in another post here. 

In the wake of it, I feel so fucking lost. I don't know where my life is going nor where to take it. Do I just get another coffeeshop job or can I find something that doesn't require a degree?

I'm scared and overwhelmed right now. I worry about being fired out of the blue again. That lack of control and anxiety about whether people like me or not is disabling in ordinary circumstances for me, and now it's flaring up so badly.

I know I just need to take practical steps and I do think that will help ground me. I'm trying to do what I can to try and diminish the whirlwind in my head right now.

It felt awful going from making ends meet to being thrust right back into poverty and the jobhunt. Self hatred boils up in me whenever I jobhunt. I feel so inadequate and that I have no prospects. 

I want structure and stability and it horrifies me that I lost all of that so suddenly.

I'm sincerely trying to work on healing from my trauma. Therapy, books, journaling, meditating. I deeply desire a sense of security. I'm tired of chaos and setbacks. I am in a living environment where I feel a lot better than before, since my roommate is a good person and not toxic like my last roommate and my family.

I barely have any savings. I can try to ask for help from my parents, which can be like pulling teeth. They aren't very empathetic and half the challenge of this whole period of my life is that I know not to go to them to talk about feelings and the risk that they'll berate me for my perceived flaws.

I'm in my 30s. I'm so tired of living like this. I can't even imagine working and going back to school at the same time so as far as that route, I don't know.

Maybe the best thing is just to find a job that isn't customer facing, as much as I loved working at coffeeshops they also burned me out.

I hope I can take the necessary steps to better employment. I don't want every job to have an invisible time limit for when I wear out my welcome enough to get the boot. I want to feel okay about myself in my day to day life. Before I got fired that was totally fine.

"Stress is getting worse Some back story about two months ago I singed up for a driving licence. My ""teacher"" at first was fine but when I was struggling with starting the car last time he thought that it was because I didn't knew how too instead of me having hard time slowly taking my legs of the pedal. He then procided to scream at me because his course of thinking ""Oh he doesn't do that correctly when I'm calm, let's scream because fear teaches faster"". That time we were standing in the middle of road trying to start the car for about 25 minutes with him screaming profanities at me.

Point is, I can't gauge my own knowledge, the knowledge of other people, or even realise what I know isn't common knowledge as I have a hard time accepting my abilities. In addition, I'll not know that I *don't* know something when I actually do if given a prompt, which leads me to not even trying to remember if I do or not, thinking I'm stupid, then an hour later remember I know a lot about what it was.

"Am I a bad person or just taking care of my mental health? I have this best friend. She's always around me, and that's not a problem. She's cool and smart, but lately I seem to be getting tired of her. She has A LOT of problems, most of them is caused by her abusive mother. I always listen to her and I don't mind she telling me negative stuff... But sometimes she is very ignorant. When I try to help her, telling her logical things that she could do to stop the situation, she always backtalk like ""Oh, but I can't do this because..."" and then, she starts again telling me her problems and how angry she is. Many times she seems to make a stupid situation to be one of the biggest problems in the world, and that annoys me.


I started to stop giving her advice and trying to help, because she never actually tried to do anything. Today I told her I was annoyed, she answered holding my hand strongly (it even hurted a bit), and then, she stayed quiet for like, 2 hours.
At the end of our class, she was again making a big fuzz, because she forgot the money to buy her mother a surprise birthday cake. I, again, tried telling her a logical thing to do: getting home, taking her wallet and buying her mother the cake. She backtalked again ""But she will see and it will not be a surprise! She already thinks I'm gonna do it!"" then I told her ""She already knows. That's it, I'm going home.""
Suddenly, she stared at me with anger and said ""How can you be happy if you don't help other people with their problems?!"" - again, I told her ""I am happy because I only deal with MY problems.""
So... She answered me with ""I will remember that when you have a problem. How would you feel?!"" - ""Happy, because that's MY problem.""

Everyone is being supporting, everyone says I seem to have a very responsbile head on my shoulders in dealing with the loss. I been undergoing bereavement counselling and this is where the ASD diagnosis has come into play.  I think in one way ASD is beneficial for things like this. But it leaves a huge hole that i cannot fill. 

Having provided long term care for my mother who had life limiting illness and my Nana, i feel a bit lost at the moment. Like a part of my life has just vanished for ever. Providing 5 years of extensive end stage care has been very demanding and I got through it with carer support for both of them. But now I am at a loss as to what to do next. I need a vacation after the funeral arrangements have been made.

The question is what next, life goes on and so must I, but I am trying to occupy myself with all mannter of things, hit the gym, plan a bit more of my future. I feel like I am trying to fill a very large hole in my head. It just feels so empty at the moment. I seem to go through phases of emotional and then none at all. But at the core I choose to move forward. Dealing with ASD and a diagnosis has helped me recognise some of that, but it sitll feels weird.

How do people cope with such a huge change in emotional states and loss?",1
"I don't even know if i have a ""special interest"" DAE relate with it? I mean, i surely have my personal interests and i like some of them more than others but the idea of a ""special interest"" being related with autism (most people that supposedly understood about it i've met always asked me what were my special interest) just looks... random, i guess? 

I know that everybody is different and there's no rule especially since ASD is well, a *spectrum* but i feel like i've never related with this concept",1
"I think one of our major causes of depression, anxiety, and other problems is how we and general society is brainwashed (hear me out) So statistically speaking we are highly likely to have depression, anxiety, and other issues. Much of this can be directly link to our unemployment/underemployed rate, treatment, etc.

&#x200B;

I think the root of this problem is how generally we are all push for work and having exact way of life. A life that requires good income/money, people around that like you, etc. To the point our education system was literally setup to make the best factory workers and other workers out there. The problem is, there is always more unemployed looking for work vs job openings. Meaning even NT get screwed sometimes. Or in other words, we are all brainwashed and groups of us suffer for this.

People (even more in places like USA) view the job = the person. So if you hear doctor you will likely think an upstanding person. Where if you hear a fast food worker you will likely think far far far less of a person. And then given types of jobs (even more when you get into the porn industry, waste management, farming, etc) they are looked down on even if they can make near 6 figures or more. In fact, many farmers have tons of money but yet look down on due to their job.

Which means if you don't have a job, can't hold down a job, and so on. Then generally you're looked down on as being lazy, sucking on the system or whatever. In fact, I remember hearing people talk down about a homeless person they seen riding his bike. Saying he was sucking on the system and so on. I can say for 100% he wasn't get ANY help from the gov. But people jump to the conclusion as he was and he is some bad person. Basically a criminal.

&#x200B;

So when those of us hit limits in ability in getting or keeping a job.  It's like if society yelled at, the person was train all their life to, and so onto walk up a mountain. And anyone who can't is a loser, scum, whatever term you want to use. And yet everyone overlooks the person has no legs and arms. And even if the person knows they have no legs and arms, they will want to still go up the mountain and they themselves is pushing for it because they were brainwash throughout their life to do something they can't ever do.

The person will want to do the thing they can't do because they were pushed throughout their life to do those impossible things for them. The society will actively push without questioning if it is impossible, and shame the person for not being able to meet their standards they were brainwashed in having in the first place. And since there is no help in fixing the brainwash and making it where their focus now needs to be on being happy with their life. Like happy in everyday things like watching birds or whatever. The person will keep digging themselves deeper in an emotional hole until they die or something changes.

"weather on my city is unpredictable This is more of a vent.

So, since December it has been raining frequently. Almost every day. I never know what to wear, cause everyday is super hot, but then it gets cold. Sometimes it doesn't get cold. Sometimes the day it cold and suddenly  gets very hot in the afternoon. 

Today the day was beautiful! The sky was super clean, it was hot and I was planning to go swimming after work. Right when I get off my shift, it started to rain just a bit, and the sky was still a bit clean, so I thought it would be just a summer rain, you know?

But then a storm started to happen on my walk back home. My shoes (snow shoes) got all wet, even on the inside. My socks were soggy. It was horrible. I couldn't go swimming.

And the cherry top on the cake was that right when I was arriving at home i went to unlock the elevator door and the keys fell in the gap between the door and the elevator. Basically a very shitty day. There was even an argument at work, because one of my coworkers didn't want to do their assignment because they were ""taking care of personal issues"" (why even bother going to work then??)

Not even people who were the closest out of the few friends I’ve had in my life. Not a single one of the few women I found myself loving either.

"Anxiety and impostor syndrome preventing me from asking for a diagnosis. I (15M) have been suspecting being autistic/asperger for months, and i think i identify with enough of the criteria for an evaluation being worth it. My father knows about my suspects and my mother doesn't and also she has an extremely steriotypical view of the issue (while im more functionating) so i don't know how she Will react. The thing is that every time i want to tell my father i want to get a diagnosis a Big anxiety comes in and i am very afraid of telling him. This anxiety usually comes with a lot of impostor syndrome where i think maybe my symptoms arent enough and that im exxagerating. 

My problem is that in every situation i Kind of lose. If i tell my father he Will probably be supporting and convince my mother. The problem is the conversation would be akward (at least from my point of view) and i cringe to painful levels when i have to describe my feelings or mental state. Also for maybe 4 months  i Will be extremely nervous about the results, since the consequences of the diagnosis arent just a yes or no, but It would cost 600 euros to my parents, so if it's negative i would feel very guilty and like an idiot. If my mother knows about my suspects, she may not agree or think im exxagerating (although probably my father would still pay the diagnosis), if the result is positive she Will believe me and everything Will be fine, but there is a 30% chance im not autistic and i don't know what her reaction could be. 

So basicly i have been weeks trying to find a good opportunity to tell my father and when i can do It i have a panic attack and quickly change theme. What do i do. The only person that can help me our of this situation is myself and i am too coward.",1
"Is substituting water with other drinks bad for me I’m a 28 year old male with an Asperger’s diagnosis (and ADHD).

"Is it wrong to use privilege to prevent NTs from leveraging their social skills against us? I come from a somewhat privileged background and have a lot of innate traits that grant me social privileges. Innate privileges being that I’m athletic, handsome, intelligent, and very tall. These traits tend to standout to NTs more than the fact I am autistic and most of them are viewed positively by NTs.

My family more or less secures my housing and lifestyle. My family bought me a house a block away from campus for college so I don’t have to worry about going homeless or hungry. 

Due to these privileges I more often than not have soft dominance over most NTs. I’m not a soft target and nobody can leverage anything meaningful over me. So because of this I find that I can get away with being myself quite a lot at the small expense of irking some unaccommodating NTs. They try to punish me socially, but other NTs defend me because they value and respect me presumably for my abilities/privileged traits. 

My question is, is it wrong to use these privileges to negate the social leverage NTs use to walk all over us? I know not everyone, NT or ND, has the privileges I do, but I found that I can utilize my privilege as either a social lubricant or a shield. 

I just want to function and thrive and it seems so many NTs want to see me fail if I don’t conform. They seem to get upset when people succeed in spite of ignoring social expectations.",1
"Does anyone have sensory issues with physical pain? Ok so to start with I'm not even sure if this is classed as a sensory trait. For as long as I can remember I have always been very sensitive to any amount of pain where others just shrug it off.

I'd go as far as saying I can't function properly till I feel ok again or the pain fully stops.",1
"hey anyone else I abuse drugs and when I get attention I start to get out of character. Don't get it tho when I'm the shyest in-person. Sometimes say the wrong things to the wrong people in the internet which makes it worse because I'm known for being quite and not saying nothing . & i shouldn't even get to judge  especially when I'm a loser . I don't got the right to talk about nobody at all. Now I got this crippling anxiety that someone is going to expose me I let my feelings the best of me and acted out of anger and hurt. I hate myself right I'm always pushing people away when I should be happy I at least got people who fuck with me when I don't know why do they like me. when Im shy and a weirdo , when I talked on the internet to those people I was mad how people treated me in the past and trying to play me out I didn't threat but I said something like if you want smoke you know wassup knowing I'm not built for it just mood swings had me feeling that way. Now I know my only friends I had who were the coolest in the world don't care about me no more . So 40 days later I went in the internet again man I was getting attention. And since I told you all my weird ass somehow hangs with coolest guys in town don't know how. Everybody knows me and my name & while I'm getting the attention I go say something tough again this 41 days later but mind you tho when I did say the tough shit to my friends I said right after that , don't even mind what I said I don't even care but you know people like the gas things up.

"Water pressure 🚿 I recently started a relationship with the woman of my dreams. It had been awhile since I had a serious relationship, and I wasn't sure how far this could go due to my hobbies and weird habits. I recently decided to move into her house (which she bought a few years ago) and since then, she has been amazing. She has been supportive of my pornography hobby and even gave me a man cave/theater room within her home to watch. There has been one issue that's been tearing us apart though, which has been the low water pressure in our shower. As a neurodivergent person, the shower is a sanctity for me. It's a warm comfortable place where I can escape my everyday issues and just relax with white noise in the background. Having low water pressure totally ruins this experience for me and I've been feeling on edge and significantly less functional since moving in. Every time I raise the issue, she dismisses it and says I'm being a big baby. She refuses to accept how important this is to me. I understand that the house isn't everything in a relationship and it shouldn't be to her either, but sometimes it feels like she cares more about the house and her pittie than me. Any advice on how I should approach this? Is it even worth continuing this relationship?",1

"Identity Politics: Help! Okay this is going to be something of a rant and a cry for help all at the same time. And by help I do not mean advice on how to do better (though that is always appreciated) but rather affirmation that my feelings are valid and that I have real concerns that are worth people's time and energy.

I am tired of the identity politics. Trans vs cis. White vs Non-white. Straight vs Gay. Religious vs secular.

I understand that to some people these identities matter a LOT, like matters of life and death. But personally, I do not give a damn about their identities. Why should I care what your gender is? Or your orientation? Or how many gods you believe in? Or if you think the world is flat or spherical? How does believing in a specific idea, or holding a particular identity, physically/mentally/financially hurt me? I cannot see how and I cannot empirically measure any harm that it does to me.

If someone pushed me, hit me, or shot me in the stomach, THAT would be physically harmful.

If someone yelled at me, bullied me, or striped me naked against my will, that would be mentally harmful.

If someone embezzled money from me, or stole from me, that would be financially harmful.

But what do these cases of harm have to do with identity? Would the physical harm I suffer be greater if the shooter was trans instead of cis? Would the emotional harm be less if a white person striped me than a black person? Would the amount of money embezzled change depending on the gender of the thief?

No. None of it would matter. Harm is independent of identity. And therefore the case should be decided on the harm being committed, not the identity of the person in question.

Now of course the world does not operate like this. There are biases and inequities built into the systems all around us. As a White American Cis-gender Male, I am rather privileged, and I am well aware of that privilege, ever since I encountered homeless children in India as a teenager. I have also been the recipient of bullying and harassment as a child due to my social awkwardness and emotional and cognitive blind-spots due to my Asperger's.

So I have my own unique perspective on the world. I fully advocate for the dismantling of implicit biases and inequities to bring about a better world, one where people are judged on their actions, not their labels.

However, as a White American, Cis-gender Male, I feel like people see me for the aforementioned labels rather than as an individual person with a unique perspective based on unique experiences and knowledge. Now my personal experiences do not compare to people of other marginalized groups, but it sometimes feels like people too frequently or too quickly judge me for being born to the historically advantaged group without thinking that maybe there are things they do not know about me. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt because I know that however much I may THINK I know about them, there is an infinite well of material that I am ignorant of.

They also cannot see that I am autistic, and if I mention it they may take it as me looking for a license to be a jerk, or a bully, or a troll. I got into trouble on Facebook when I accidentally invoked a dog-whistle used by the Right to derail conversations about marginalization, and the person I was talking to started treating everything I said as a racist smokescreen and beat me over the head until I basically begged for help. Note that he did NOT seek to clarify my intent, even going so far as to say that impact matters more than intent, or inform me about a major mistake or miscommunication. He immediately assumed the worst of me and went on the attack.

Would he have done the same thing if I was Black? Or Trans? Or female? Or some other combination thereof? I do not know, and I cannot empirically verify whether he would or would not have.

So to end a very long and tiring post, I feel like I am being judged badly simply because I was born to a specific demographic at a specific time and place. I want a better world but I want others to treat me as though I belong in that world. I want everyone to live in a world where they are judged by their actions and granted the same grace as everyone else. And it infuriates me when I feel like this is not the case.

Now obviously this is complicated and messy. But it has been heavy on my mind for a while and I would very much appreciate advice on how to navigate the world of social justice given the labels that I carry with me, and how to assert myself to others if I feel like I am being judged for the people I resemble, not the actions I have committed. I want to do better, but I also want verification that my feelings and concerns are valid and not just brushed aside.

"Social rules for when you're meant to be included vs not Is there any way others have figured out to tell whether you're meant to be invited or included in a social situation? I tend to assume my presence is unwanted unless proven otherwise. Like I'm invited to do something or someone looks at me and says something in their conversation with the other people. 

My husband tells me that I should not hide away when my step kids visit and that they want to hang out with me. But I made myself available and after 1.5-2 hours they just continued to play a two player game and didn't even attempt to stop or ask if I wanted to do something with them. He says he doesn't want me to disappear but if you are going to leave me out of what you are doing and not even acknowledge you're doing that, then I am going to assume I should just disappear. 

I want clear, consistent rules for this type of situation because I struggle with it in many different contexts. I err on the side of assuming nobody wants me there which is probably not true in many cases but I assume it is then find evidence to support my belief because that's what brains do. I can't do this ad hoc, case by case approach because I worry that I am getting it wrong and people are annoyed with me and just being polite. But others do not routinely expect to offer reassurance like this and of course I understand that children can't be expected to do that. I don't expect that from the children. But if my husband means what he says then his actions have to match but they didn't match and now I'm just hurt and confused.

"I’m a self aware autistic narcissist and the main problem is not even my autism, it’s my narcissism Like sure I’m autistic, and it makes it harder to connect with people when ur autistic, but in my case the narcissism is the main problem. With thinking I’ve realized Its very hard for me to have a genuine connection, everything in my mind is superficial, and has to fit in some sort of deluded idea that I have. Everything was other people feels superficial in my mind. No genuine connections that much, with a sense of high importance that I have. However, this doesn’t involve my family though. With my family it’s not superficial and there’s a genuine care that I would have for them

Now I think this happened due to my childhood trauma from being autistic, and being misunderstood and treated differently due to it when I was a little kid. Overall very traumatic. So therefore it’s made me become a narcissist as a way to cope or some shit, and now I can’t genuinely connect and love like a normal person could. I’m constantly getting bored with people, and look for supply over and over again. This doesn’t apply to my family though. My trauma happened from people OUTSIDE my family, so that’s why it doesn’t apply to my family I think. It all makes sense now. So even though I am autistic, I believe that’s only a part of the problem. I don’t know bruh. I also have BPD. I remember when I was younger, before my trauma really sunk in my brain, I think I felt more genuine connections to people, and it wasn’t just about getting supply like how it is now. It explains my chronic emptiness also. All I know is, my childhood has fucked me up so badly and I’m just now starting to see it.

I really don't want to be alone; but at the same time I hear alot of girls complain about how annoying it is to be hit on all the time and it's always more important to not let my mental health issues adversely affect others. It doesn't help that I'm one ugly son of a whore.",1
"A few things I’ve noticed Me wanting to ask if me ranting about another autistic makes me sound autistic? But then being too afraid of the answer, so I stay quiet.

Me wanting to share about all the things I’ve done in my mind this week, but not in reality.

Me wanting to show emotion for a friend who just lost an in-law and has to take time to help their family deal, when I simply want to update them on crap at work that has zero bearing on their life. I do care, just can’t relate.

Me wanting to talk about the new Star Trek episode and debate it’s finer points, when they couldn’t care less and I know it. 

Me, realizing all of these things, vibing to a song I just discovered, six times in a row, still trying to figure out the meaning of the lyrics that is obviously open to interpretation and I know that, but want meaning anyway. 

Me finding a random performance of said song done drastically different than all the rest, and refusing to believe the band would have ever done that. Coming to terms with it, then saying I’ll never listen to that version ever again!

Me just wanting to wake up, go to work, have nothing different, come home, eat something I’ve eaten often, and go to bed. 

Me realizing all of this is allegedly “normal” yet has never once felt normal to me after 40+ years on this rock",1
"Do you lack empathy? People are saying that the lack of empathy at Asperger's is a myth. I am an Aspie, I want to help people and I do as much as I can because it is the right thing for me, but I dont feel empathy for them. For instance if something happens to a friend, I will try to help because I feel I have to, but I will not feel sad about them. Its like I cant emotionally care or feel sad about people because I lack some emotions and they are just replaced by my logic.",1
"Knowing that i will never be the person that i want really hurts and it's depressing I want to be the guy who is surrounded by people and respect, can laugh at jokes, has a social circle, is powerful, knows everything about what other people say in conversation.I wanted to write this message longer thanks to my english skills.  


I want to be powerful. I want control. But none of my dreams are achievable due to my aspergers and ADHD. It is really limiting and depressing and i've been laying down and rotting in house 2 years for now. Achieving dreams needs disicpline, hardwork and lonely-time. Lonely time is chosen in this situation, not all time. What about planning? ADHD ruins it. I want complete a task, my attention goes to another thing, and another so on so forth i fail to achieve the first step.   


It's like a hungry person always getting served the best food in the world but never have the ability to eat due to it not having a mouth. It is really depressing and i don't want to live like this forever.",1

"Why does everyone avoid me I feel so alone. I have always felt this way. I have never had friends. No one cares about me. No matter how many tries it has taken, everyone will always pretend like i dont even exist. I have been an outcast all my life with everyone calling me weird and too shy. I just got into high school and things feel the same again. No one is bullying me anymore, but i feel even more lonely now. At the start no one knew eachother, so i had a fresh start. I tried my everyhting to interact and be nice to everyone, despite my social amxiety. Everyone seemed nice to me back, but still no one took interest in talking to me ever again. Everyone else found friends for themselves except me. Why is it that i still dont fit in? Nowadays i feel like everyone is just trying their best to avoid me and ignore my existance. No one cares if im alone. I have been nothing but friendly and helpful towards them but i just cant seem to understamd why im still being the only one alone. I feel like i will always be the different one. Alone.",1
"Are there some things you just never learn no matter what? I don’t understand but for some reason no matter what there’s certain things I just don’t learn no matter what e.g. grammatical definitions, the names of actors, important cultural moments that are poignant to the collective I’m a part of etc…

Some things no matter how much I try to focus on them, seek to learn and remember the information it just doesn’t stick… Give it a few hours and I’ll struggle to remember this information once again as if I’m starting from fresh again. 

For other things I have no problem remembering… It’s like certain ‘types’ of data doesn’t compute… Numbers I remember very easily however some information input just doesn’t process.

"Can anyone else relate? Throughout my life, I've thought it was genuinely weird that people could be interested in things but not feel compelled to participate in them. For example, when I was a teen I was obsessed with heavy metal, and so were my friends. But most of them were happy to listen to the music and go to concerts. I wanted to play in a band. Not unusual, I know. But I distinctly remember at the time wondering how it is that someone could like something, but not get deeply involved in it.  Since then, the pattern has repeated over and over. It seems like I am incapable of just enjoying something for its own sake. I always feel compelled to **do** the thing. Now that I suspect that I have Aspergers (the official evaluation is next month), I'm wondering if this is more of an aspie trait. Can anyone else relate?",1

I just seem to come off as awkward, unable to judge the conversation, can’t read body language, unable to make eye contact. Sometimes someone will come attemp to talk to me and I just stand there in silence with no idea what to say. It’s becoming more prevalent with age (I’m 15. If I’m next to someone new, I choke up whenever trying to talk, let alone trying to move to someone/direct a conversation.

"Donating my body to Science after I'm done using it I'm currently 33, diagnosed ASD/ADHD at 29, and as I've gone deeper down the rabbit hole of autism research something disturbed me. The lack of research is disconcerting; while I would never cure my autism, I would like to better understand it for altruistic and my own selfish reasons.

Unfortunately, it seems the only way to study someone's brain is for that person to be dead (otherwise the procedure would ensure they were, sorry bad humor). I've never had any want to be buried when I pass so I always said cremate me and do whatever with it. However, the need to be dead and my lack of concern with my own body post-mortem seems to pose an opportunity. Is there any scientific community or researchers out there to contact about arranging documentation to study my body (or mind, but hey my body ain't half bad) in the pursuit of Autism research? Even if it isn't Autism related, I would be satisfied with them at least using my brain to better understand how the brain functions.

"Do you ever get in situations in where you have trouble speaking and/or interacting with some people who your friends or people you talk to interact with(especially if they’re friends with them)?

There’s one guy I talk to and he has a girlfriend. I can’t bring myself to talk to his girlfriend even if she’s already known me for long. Then there’s this guy with a skateboard whom we always shy out on each other but that he talk to coworkers who are used to me and I talk. Then there’s this young female coworker whom we’re used to talking to each other the most out of anyone and that she’s aware of autism cause she has family members who have it(and she’s bipolar), but with her mother also working the same job…I can’t get used to interacting with her friendly mother at all…

"This sub helped me to accept myself My life was a constant crisis and kept getting overwhelmed. I posted a question about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/10njv8q/do_you_live_in_perpetual_crisis/) and the people who seemed to have it under control told me it was because of 'acceptance'.

Accepting myself was hard, but I feel so much better now. Like I can finally just let go and live again. Even though acceptance is hard to explain (and maybe someone else can do it better), I want to try and maybe help some others:

It started with analyzing the symptoms and how/when they affect me. First it frustrated me, then I forced myself to cater my life to it. Even though unpleasant; I changed my routine so it now includes things I would normally not do (daily exercise, diet, sleep, socializing, self care, keeping busy, etc). 

Also I accept some things will never happen for me. A [latin proverb](https://ivakostadinova.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/hope-is-the-first-step-on-the-road-to-disappointment-latin-proverb/) says “Hope Is The First Step On The Road To Disappointment”. Wanting things that are out of reach is like torturing yourself. It's really hard to 'just let go', but it's a start to stop thinking about things that are out of reach (right now). 

The final thing that helped me was realizing that everything good comes with something bad. When the good outweighs the bad: it's good, stop thinking about it. 

Like I had to live with my parents for a while at 37 years old. They treated me like a child by being controlling, but they also gave me a home, fed me and washed my clothes. Being treated like a child has two sides to it and it sure beats being homeless. 

It was not fun to be there, but it was *good* and I am grateful for it. I apply this to everything now. Some things still suck, but accepting helps.",1

"Question about suppressing of stims Today I was at the dentist which I dislike because I can’t stim like I normally do. Not only that, but the lady kept asking me questions while poking my gums with a needle throughout the entire time!! In situations where I’m not supposed to move a lot, I find I start to become acutely aware that I’m not supposed to move. It only makes the situation worse, and as hard as I try to not move, I will eventually start to jolt a little. It’s almost like having hypnotic jerks before falling asleep, but this time I’m awake. 

She asked me if I was okay several times because I kept jolting slightly, and was overall very tense feeling.

Can autism traits and triggers change over time? So when I was younger I use to live listening to loud music. Now I just can't stand it. Makes me very agitated unless it's through my headphones.

"I'm considered quite smart, but I have a huge barrier absorbing types of information(like written), Got any tips? I do engineering work. I have strengths in with original problem solving, but not consistently fast at it.

\-Learning is very challenging depending on how it's presented to me. Spoken word can be very smooth, especially when using metaphors(which I use a lot of too). Telling me how to do something can be far more challenging than guiding me through the actions directly (like reading/telling a person how to drive vs, get in the car and start doing it).   
\-I also notice, things rarely stick with me unless they are uniquely interesting/critical, or if they are practiced over a decent period of time.   
\-visual puzzles are very fun, and I'm pretty quick to them; worded or math... not so much.    
\-I am able to grasp new/complex concepts rather quickly, again depending how they are presented to me, even ones in fields completely unpractised to me, I can understand terms/words, I've never heard before, just by using context.    
\-If given written content to learn something, like to use a simple phone app, i get very uncomfortable, I avoid it HARD, and will choose to not use the app at all or just bash my way through it until I figure it out... which can work, but I know I'm not getting the total picture on how to use the app.

"Why does it feel sad to love people? (Tw suicide) For a long time, I wasn’t sure I loved anyone but my dogs. Then I fell in love with a friend. I didn’t want to do anything about it, but having such a intense, almost obsessive feeling made me realize I did actually love other people too, like my family and a few friends.

I do not need very much from people, and get overwhelmed easily. I think I would not be able to bear the traditional intimacy of partners, I do not mean sex, just the entanglement of lives. I still love my friend, when I see them I feel happy and have energy all day, but I also feel something uncomfortable that is like sadness, it feels like my lungs are swollen. I feel this way also when I think about my dogs, who both are dead now. And when I think of my mom, who I don’t talk to much anymore. And even my dad, who I see often. 

When I fell in love with my friend, I felt creepy and insane. But I didn’t want to give up the feeling, because it made me also feel that the world was precious. Sometimes I do not talk to anyone for months. Then I do not have the swollen lung feeling, and the world is easy to pass through.

Life unfortunately gave me ASD. I'm now all alone, 24, and still struggle to make friends, get dates, and living like a normal, successful human being. It's not getting easier. There's only a few of you here that even beat the odds and have good social skills. I believe this is the key to a good life and that is my personal belief. I hope to hear from actual successes.

2. Practice on many thousands of random social circles

3. Gain close friends for feedback

"I left my friendgroup because they started to treat me differently I am really frustrated and I dont know what I should do. Sorry in advance if I make any grammar mistakes. English is not my native language.
For the context, I’m female and got diagnosed for aspergers one year ago. We were seven people in the friendgroup, I was the only female. After I got my diagnosis, everyone was supportive and I hoped that I finally had found real friends (I‘ve never had real friends because they always left me for the same reason: I was „wierd and sad all the time“). Because everyone in the group was extremely introverted, we only met for christmas and birthdays. But we played videogames every night. I like that because social events in person can stress me really fast, I tend to not go to spontaneus parties for this reason. Then, few months ago, another girl joined the group, and there the problems started to begin. She was very nice to the boys, but to me, she was… too nice. When she spoke to me, she was so calm, that she nearly whisperd. She asked me if she could tie my shoes and carry my bag for me. I tried to explain to her that I dont need her help and that I can do things by my own. But she never stopped asking me if she could help. Some of the boys started to ask me too if I need help and they made me feel like a five year old. I‘m an adult so this made me feel even more different from the others. When I asked her why she didnt ask any of the boys if they needed help she didnt have an answer. She also wanted us to meet up nearly every weekend and when I declined she accused me of hating her. Thats why I left the friendgroup. I dont know if she treated me differently because I have aspergers, and dont get me wrong sometimes I need help, but not with basic stuff like tiing shoes. I just had to get this off my chest and it still hurts me because I really liked that group. Maybe I‘m overreacting but they all made me feel lower then them. I tried to talk with some of the boys, one left the group with me because he was tired of this friendgroup aswell and the others just gave me hints that I should adjust myself.",1

This employee is talking over/interrupting customers, is monotone, and comes off rude. Calls are being escalated often and I need to find a way for them to hear what the customer hears when these calls go badly. 

I’ve attempted to coach this individual before soon after they were hired, but they became very defensive, even with a gentle, positive approach. They did get a little better temporarily following that coaching, though. 

But I’m hoping to hear different approaches or techniques from the community. 

Just on my own, I’ve come up with the following: 

•I plan on reviewing a bad call, but also reviewing a good call, providing I can find one. I’ll still review a decent call even if I can’t find one with a desired “sunshine-y” voice. I don’t want to overwhelm them with the negative. 

•Outlining what he IS doing well so he doesn’t feel like this is an attack and get defensive

•Finding multiple calls, both good and bad, and asking him to identify the strengths and weaknesses in the calls

•If he can’t find his own warm, friendly tone naturally, asking him to exaggerate what he thinks one sounds like and if it fits what we need, suggest he use that in practice. It may not sound authentic to him, but if it sounds better to the customer than how the calls currently sound, I’m okay with that. 

•When reviewing calls, asking them ahead of time to stop the call when they hear a targeted behavior like interrupting, monotone voice, etc. 

Any other suggestions? Or are any of these absolute no-no’s? 

I really want to emphasize here that I want this employee to succeed and grow, so I’m really open to anything that I can get HR to approve lol.

ETA:  While I was researching, I did see that call centers weren’t a good fit for these individuals, so I’m hoping we can be the exception here. This individual is young, out on their own, seems like they don’t have much of a social life, and was very upset about their last job not working out. They’re a very diligent worker and very by-the-book and I just want to make sure I do my due diligence and really know where they’re coming from and what their struggles are. That way, I can coach in a manner that truly reaches them and benefits them because obviously, the traditional ways aren’t working and I really want them to have a fair chance… and it’s not fair if I don’t take their challenges into consideration, so thanks in advance for all of the advice! ❤️",1
"How do I practice self-forgiveness? 2022 didn't plan out well and I can't help but resent myself. Last year confirmed for me at least that I most likely am on the spectrum - I can't grow out of my deficiencies and patterns in my life stay the same to this day.  I ended up falling out with a friend group, mostly because I was difficult, missed the chance to start dating, and allowed someone close to me to manipulate and take advantage of me.   
I've lost out on connections and golden opportunities, and even if I can make up for these mistakes I can't outrun the regret or trauma of being treated badly.

&#x200B;

How can I learn to forgive myself? I've been tearing myself up inside for too long and it's not getting easier. I've ended up in a spiral worse than at any other point in my life. I cannot let things go and fearful these past 12 months have knocked me down for good.",1
"Did anyone else ""pretend"" as a kid? When I was a little kid and far lower functioning I would do this thing that I called ""pretending"" where I would find something with a good texture (Like a sock or blanket) and just kind of squeeze it between my fingers, I'd close my eyes and use the pleasant texture to focus my thoughts and I would just contemplate, and daydream, and fantasize, but I had to keep feeling the texture or I would lose focus.

I was always doing it as a kid, this was obviously what made my parents know I was autistic because I constantly did it everywhere, I often did it with the rim of my shirt at school, and when kids asked what I was doing I'd respond with ""pretending""

This stim faded with age as I became more socially aware, but I still start doing it by muscle memory when I'm relaxed and start daydreaming.",1

"Anyone into programming? I've been programming for like 6 maybe 7 years now. I'm not amazing, I mean that's why I'm going to college for it I guess. I am self taught, but I always wanted to get better.

Why am I posting here? Excellent question! In probably the most stereotypical manner for aspies, I am posting to see if anyone else that enjoys programming would like to chat, and maybe work on projects together. I would love to have someone to bounce ideas off of and learn from, or just talk to someone who gets it.

Hope you all have a nice day!",1
"Advice please: Some aspies are really gifted in certain areas and I've finally found mine, but am now struggling with ¿envy? from others. I don't think I'm superior at all (I can list my struggles and flaws) but somehow I reflect the short-comings of others and they resent me for it... For nearly two decades I'd struggled with mental health and self-esteem, and now I've found flow in an area where things come easily/naturally to me. I can't express how grateful I am to have found my \*thing\* in life, and my family/friends/partner are really happy for me to see things (finally) working out.  
 I've been in a position where I wasn't as good as other people at something and learnt to graciously recognise they have a talent that I simply don't - its no one's fault.   
In this new field I have very quickly picked up a skill to a strong level (but lack knowledge). When asking for help, which I ask for in a clear, specific, grateful manner (and I ask others to check my phrasing too) people (NTs?) seem to interpret it as arrogant.   
How can it be arrogant if I'm asking for advice? I'm literally sharing an area of ignorance/inexperience/inadequacy and its somehow rubbed people up the wrong way. I realise the level of skill absolutely does not equate to the time spent learning it, which although is a lucky gift for me, seems to curse me as annoying or intimidating to others. Dude, I'm trying to get by just like everyone else, and now I have a chance. Life is hard enough.   


I'm trying to not be upset because I want solutions and to develop my craft further, but I can't help remember the way people treated me at school (15 years ago).   
I know it's an egoic reflection of others and not me, but when its a certain volume of people reacting this way, that gets difficult to hold on to. I try so carefully to think and phrase things as politely as possible, pre-empt misinterpretations, even specify what I'm \*not\* saying.   
I'm the common denominator here, so of course I automatically look inward at what I've done/said wrong, what/if something needs adjusting or improving, but I know (as do the people around me) that I have pure and simple intentions to just learn better. But inexplicably, something about me irks others. I've been told time and time again its envy, but it feels arrogant and bizarre that people would envy me.  


Any advice or perspectives that might help would be greatly appreciated.",1

"It is possible to for an aspie to be empathetic and understand sarcasm/facial expressions? I've never fit in with anyone. Have always been awkward and weird in school, teacher used to treat me different, people(even my classmates) baby-talked and were gentle with me because they thought there was something wrong with me.

I have a few of the signs--getting obsessed with one topic for a period of time, trouble making eye contact, need clear instruction. I'm not an emotional person, but I'm able to understand why somebody is angry or crying.

When I watch movies, I'm able to read the actor's facial expressions even when they're not talking. I can sense the atmosphere. I understand different tones of voice.

I know what to do, but I get too anxious and embarrassed to actually do it. Like, in school, the teacher would look around the room when discussing a topic, and stare at random students--like a que to give an opinion. She'd look at me a few times, and I KNEW she wanted me to talk, but I was too shy to talk in front of the class.

I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I assume I have either social anxiety or Avoidant Personality Disorder. I'm well able to understand other peoples' body langauge and speaking tone, so I don't know if I could be autistic.

I'm not a teenager, BTW. I'm an adult.",1
loud thoughts Have you ever had the sensation of your thoughts being so loud and preasant in your head that you feel like they are being telepathically broadcasted to everyone around you?,1
The way I wish managers would learn to work with me I wish they'd just come to me calmly and tell me what I did wrong and what I can do to correct it and also what I'm doing right. Getting only negative or only positive reinforcement isn't good. There needs to be a balance. I feel like a lot of NTs don't understand how to work this way with us since they mostly react on emotion. I'm sick of people who are unfit to be managers or run a business just being assholes cause they're in charge and are on a power trip.,1
I just got enrolled in a summer program at a college. Basically a friend of mine told me about this program he wants to attend at this collage made for people like us. Apparently it’s supposed to be very interesting and will last for a entire week! I’m looking forward too it personally & even have the option of enrolling at this place full-time. I’m actually kinda happy as I can finally be in an area with other people like me.,1
"Anyone else find it hard to find friends who are patient enough to understand you and your “struggles” with life and society. More and more I find that it’s hard making friends when on the ASD spectrum.

I feel like no matter how hard I try to work on myself and be better, people eventually ghost me or leave me entirely. No one ever reaches out, I’m always the one who has to put in the effort to make things work, and it’s fucking exhausting. 

I know I have my problems, everyone does, but I just don’t know what else to do.

I try to be as kind and understanding as I can be towards others, as I truly care about others and just like wanting to see myself happy, I want to see others happy too, as Ik the pain one may go through each day can be hard to bare.

At this point I am ready to give up on making friends with people in a society that isn’t designed to accommodate someone who is like me. 

It’s getting too exhausting and painful.",1
"I had a question for everyone here.. So, my sister was diagnosed with aspergers and I wanted to know how I can best help her. She's high functioning, if that matters here (I don't know much about the spectrum, sorry..). I just want to know so I can support her the best I can. I try to help with schoolwork and other things but I feel as if it doesn't reach her. Any advice would be greatly appriciated!",1
"Could use some support. I am struggling and am scared I am diagnosed ADHD and sensory processing disorder, and suspected ASD (my therapist believes I am autistic). I am also a single mom and am currently the only working parent (my ex is unemployed) providing for our child. 

I shifted from remote to in person work last year as a way to earn more money, and it has been hands down one of the most stressful years of my life. The main issue I faced, was a coworker whom was hired to be on my team ended up having a lot of drug issues and harassed me inside and outside of work for almost 8 months. Not to mention she was frequently absent due to her drug use and her entire workload fell onto my shoulders completely. She was eventually brought a weapon into the office so she was fired, but since then, her workload became my permanent responsibility. So I have been doing the work of two people for an entire year. Not to mention I work in advertising, so the clients at this company have been borderline abusive, so we have had a lot of meetings with HR about this as well. Like I said, it’s been a shit show.

I have been burned out for so long, that I am starting to get frightened by myself. I feel insane. I surpassed all the late stage burnout symptoms in December, now I am left with just apathy, pain, anger and strong, constant emotional outbursts. This has also manifested into some physical issues that my work has not been very accommodating towards at all, so I am dealing with all of that while trying to fly under the radar while struggling tremendously. Im at the point where I would honestly rather stop living than continue coming into this job every day and as a mother, that frightens me. 

I literally am at my wits end. I don’t know where to go from here. I can’t take any time off work, because nobody else is able to fill in for me. I also don’t have enough PTO accrued this year to be able to take any time off. I have received a doctors note to work from home more due to physical issues I am having, but my boss was not happy about it and so I caved and have been coming in every day despite being in pain.

I know I am not great at advocating for myself, but I was raised by an autistic father who taught me to hide my real self as much as possible otherwise I will be unemployed and homeless. 38 years of believing that is hard to erase. In the meantime, logistically, what are my options? I cannot physically continue on this way, and I am looking for other jobs but that takes time.

Anyone have any ideas of how I could get some time off without losing my job and my son losing his insurance? I am moving back in with my family in May which will help, but I don’t think I can force myself through this current situation for another two months without something scary potentially happening as a result of my mental state.",1
"questions about hobbies/obsessions. Hi. I have a few questions, as the title says. I'm not on the spectrum (diagnosed anyways) and I just wanted to talk about my weirdness, because I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about it.
 The first thing I remember having an obsession with was SpongeBob SquarePants. Growing up in the early 2000s, it probably wasn't uncommon. The second time was when the movie Frozen came out. I was addicted. I wanted to know everything about it. I spent hours learning the songs in multiple different languages, watching behind the scenes, and even getting interested in art and animation because of it. Others include Fallout 3, Minecraft, cranes (the vehicle) painting, sculpture, and The Long Dark.

The main reason why I'm asking about the possibility of being on the spectrum is because I'm not always having moments like this. Right now (and for the previous few years on and off) it's writing and the Sims.

Any thoughts?

TLDR: is my tendency to get obsessed with certain activities/things a symptom of ASD?",1
"I really want the opinions of Aspies and other folks who like participating in this subreddit on this? Okay so people say that aspies and low supports needs autistic people are often “talented people who just have a little bit of trouble understanding people sometimes”. If that’s true, then why does it seem like most if not all of us want to unalive ourselves to some degree. I’m just saying, pretty much every aspie and low supports needs autistic person I’ve met battled sewerslidal thoughts, at least to some degree at some point. That makes it hard for me to believe that our only problem is “having a little bit of trouble with understanding people sometimes”. I don’t think having minor trouble understanding people here and there would make someone want to die. So there’s got to be more to it than that. Anyone else see where I’m going with this?",1
"Going to a social even where you embarrassed yourself in a serious way, and I already feel drained To explain it short: my social skills are -145. Very often I say stuff that comes across wrong and then I can't explain, because the emotions throw me off.

Last time, I fucked up greatly. We were talking about censorship and I quoted a paragraph from an older book. Not going into this, but it includes a term in my language, which was used to describe black people. Not like the N-word, but rather like the Spanish way of saying ""black"". Welp. Turns out, in our culture, this term has now risen from an ""old-fashioned uncomfortable"" term to... well, being the N-word. Basically.

I didn't know that. Of course I didn't. I knew it was uncomfortable so I even put air quotes. But still everyone went silent and the only black person at the table (because that's my luck) simply said that white people aren't even ""allowed"" to say it. Not even if quoting a text.

I never called anyone that term. I never do. I was just trying to use an example. And now everyone thinks I'm a racist. And I couldn't even apologize because she was quickly out the door when it ended.

"Is It normal that when you are aware of your differences with most people (example: bad socialitation, weird actitude...) You start to consider others as inferior and you start getting a high ego basicly maybe as a way of coping with the differencies i experience in relation to other people i have developed a sense of my emotions and thoughts forming a ""safe space"". like the combination of all my interests and points of view is something that form my personality and this leads me to maybe hate people that are less similar to me. since always i have developed friendships based on similar interests and how similar the person is to me (as a kid i wanted to clone myself so i could be my own best friend). so basicly when i see people consider me as weird mainly in the social aspect i think to myself that those things form who i am, and it doesnt matter if its good or bad because it's mine.

it is really difficult to explain and i probably sounded narcissistic but in a summary it is thinking about all the things that form your identity/personality as superior (not neccesarily believing you are better than other people but simply having a lot of ego)

this has to do with the fact i know my mind cant be really shared as a pack. because of this i have always wanted a deep psycho analysis to have someone know every details of my mind or i wish conciense could be storaged in a digital unit.",1
"This is just a vent This is just a vent because I don’t really have anyone to talk to. My wife doesn’t understand.

I am just frustrated that our entire society revolves around how social you are. If you aren’t talkative and social I feel like you are perceived as inferior or defective and you suffer in society. For example I love BJJ, however, I am always struggling to find partners to work with and people to roll with because I’m not sociable so I am not integrated with the class. As a result I end up getting stuck with partners who are brand new and don’t know anything so my ability to train is hampered. I also struggle to find people to roll with at the end of class because everyone has cliches and I don’t fit in them. 

This applies to my career as well. I’m not a “popular” therapist or desired therapist amongst patients at work because I am not a small talker and don’t enjoy chit chat. Again just venting as I’m frustrated with my life and current circumstances. I feel like I’m metaphorically stuck in high school at the lunch table alone. I don’t want friends or to socialize but I also don’t want my life experiences to be hampered due to my aversion to be a socialite.",1

"In the spirit (ba-dum-tish!) of a recent thread, does anyone else feel “fixed” on clonazepam? I didn’t reply to [this recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/11iis65/does_anyone_else_feel_like_ur_normal_under_the/) because I related to it so much I feared I’d find it triggering. The Demiurge made the thing that gives me one of the strongest senses that life is worth living, extremely unhealthy. Good job. Alcohol scares me very much. I hate to love it.

Do any other folks on the spectrum find the same holds true for clonazepam, almost as strongly? I’m well aware, both professionally and personally, that people who like alcohol a bit too much for their own good, seem to overlap strongly with people who like benzos a bit too much for their own good. But there’s something special, specifically, about clonazepam. I find it just much more motivating and conducive to a deep sense of wellbeing and social aplomb, in a way that matches alcohol (minus the excessive sedation and body load!) in a way that other benzos don’t.

It goes without saying, unless you’ve surrendered to nihilism in all its forms, that both alcohol and benzos are traps that are hard to escape, take a huge toll on QOL, and are to be avoided if at all possible. But boy oh boy if they (especially clonazepam) make life and society feel a whole lot more tolerable.",1
"Non-verbal vs. verbal communication - preference? As I age, I find myself becoming more at peace when I can communicate without words, especially when it has to do with my love language. I honestly just ask my S.O. if we can just look at each other without talking, and we smile, cry, and laugh together without much more than maybe breaking the silence with the odd ""I love you"". As an aspie I feel my inner self at peace when I can feel at home talking without actually talking with another person. Words are so... Definitive. So... Pointy, edged, and narrow. While on the other hand, non-verbal communication is so comforting to me, its like I can take off the shell, and the mask I have to wear and be innocent, feel pure, just like floating on a cloud as the wind brushes against my face. Language to me can be so incredibly tiring. Can you relate to any of this?

"People are starting to accuse me of being ""on the spectrum"" I am currently 16M and am in high school. I have mild Asperger's, and my parents and teachers know. 

However, I do not want my peers to find out. I think I would be less popular, and that people would look down on my/feel bad for me if they knew. It is a harsh truth, but I think people on the spectrum are lowkey seen as inferior and felt bad for, I know I tend to dislike neurodivergent people (I don't dislike them FOR being neurodivergent, but the behaviors they exhibit as a result of this annoy me).

I also feel like people knowing I have Asperger's would hurt my chances of getting a gf.

"I think one of the things that means the most to me is when someone I like sits next to me on purpose It hardly ever happens, and this is not important. I am just trying to preserve this feeling. I find groups so hard to be around, that in class and meetings, I will usually find the person I like the most, and sit in a place near their vicinity, but not obviously next to them, because I am worried they will be annoyed. This gives me a feeling of safety, like someone is acting as a filter between me and the unfiltered energy generated by a large mass of humanity haha. 

A few days ago, I had to go to a giant meeting for my job. I sat kind of in a corner away from the main group, which was nice because no one was behind or next to me. One of the people I care most about in world came over and sat in the seat immediately in front of me. I do not think it was on purpose, but he turned around and talked to me a few times. I kept expecting him to get up and go sit with someone else, but he stayed there for the rest of the meeting. 

The feeling reminds me of when my dogs used to wake up and get out of their beds, just so that they could jump onto the couch and sleep next to me. I know it is not actually anything, but I think this is one of the most precious solaces I know, when someone I like sits near me, possibly on purpose.",1

"Obsession over bad word I gained an obsession with a horrible word recently, I cannot stop using it in my head to refer to myself and to others. Sometimes it is meant to insult myself, sometimes it is not related to context at all. I have enough self control to know never to say it in person or online, but it is unpleasant because the word is a slur.

I'm a man of 37yo, aspie with ADHD. I'm working in IT and got a new job that I really enjoy for a few months now.

During  last session with my therapist, I mentioned that I'm quite struggling  to focus during meetings, specially when working from home. He replied,  quite informally that Lion's mane could help me, he didn't say more  about it.

I read quite a lot of  testimonies about it here and on r/Nootropics,  I have to say I'm quite scared now. Every  online shop never mention side effects but I've read about, fog,  headaches and people feeling dumber after taken some.

Should  I still try it? I can't ""afford"" being ""dumb"" with my new job, what is  your opinion? Is there better alternative to keep focus? I'm already  taking Zafran and Gaba, could it interfere with Lion's mane?

They feel I have spent money foolishly because I have been trying to invest in real estate. The tax deeds and liens are going slow but am not losing money. Tonight they asked my brother about how I can cut my expenses and he innocent suggest changing hair dresser. Then I think my brother is being an asshole the hair dresser is not the cheapest but that yearly expense is not the problem.

"Feeling unlovable. It's triggering suicidal thoughts TLDR; I feel unlovable due to past traumas and nothing I do seems to work (and I've done a lot). I'm thinking of ending things.

Hello, I am a 24 y/o M, diagnosed last year.  I'll try my best to explain my situation but it might get a little convoluted.

I always felt different to everyone else (I figure that's somewhat the norm here). I was always considered ""gifted"" intellectually .  I am also extremely empathetic and sensitive, which I personally would prefer to not be: It's hard to cry for watching a sunset when you are a male, specially in the Latin american society where I live which is more conservative.

Since I was a kid I had social issues because I come from a very dysfunctional family, which gave me a very deep abandonment wound, so I didn't get the support I needed to understand social norms and basically had to learn everything the hard (and very traumatic) way. My father was present but unable to provide and work and give a masculine figure, and my mother always made me feel like an obligation to her, and conditioned her love to my results in life. This made me very insecure and unable to see worth in myself and my accomplishments, which is something I still struggle with today.

So I was also raised in a high-society school and college when I didn't really have any money given the financial hardships of my family, which further broadened the feeling of never belonging. Throughout all my life I've never felt I have belonged anywhere, in any social groups. What's crazy is that other people don't think that, they think I have friends and I am a normal person, I am just too good in masking my suffering.

Regarding romantic relationships I only had one  with which I lasted two months. All my life my main goal was to replace that love my family never gave me with a couple and I have never been able to do it. I usually give too much too son, because of my abandonment wound, and also my aspie side makes me act always in an ""all or nothing"" mindset, meaning that if I receive a setback I usually leave, because I think the other person doesn't want me anymore, or just because of my hyper sensitivity it hurts so bad that I can't stand being alive.

I have done everything to get a partner:

* I tried so hard to love myself (and succeeded to a degree). Did my best to discover my identity
* Learned about my past trauma, went to therapy for a year (where I got my Aspie diagnosis) and worked very hard to overcome it
* Started lifting and got a reasonable good physique
* Learned social skills (heck, I even paid 3000 USD for a personalized social coach)
* Learned about women (had my red pill phase which I have now overcome)
* Bought new clothes,  polished my social media accounts, made female friends who I constantly ask about how to treat a woman

This ""improvements"" made more girls attracted to me (and also this  girls are more physically attractive) but everything stays the same at the end of the day.

To be honest, I would make such a good partner from a logic standpoint. I am a good person, I make very good money from a remote position in a US company as a software engineer living in Latin America. It hurts me everyday deep in my heart to see how everything I do seems to be in vain.  At least three times I have dated girls, which dumped me and went back with their exes less than a month later. Thing is I am so hurt that I keep attracting hurt people who either manipulate me or are not ready for relationships.

I also thing my character seems to ward off girls since sometimes I can't stand things that they do. For example I had a date yesterday with a very high value girl, and she arrived almost 40 minutes late. I left and let her know I was angry, but thing is culture here kinda allows a degree of late arrival to meetings, it's just that I don't do that and let her know beforehand I wanted her to be on time. But other people can stand that and end up in relationships. I think I should chase them more sometimes, but it's also unfair to receive these kind of treatments as a man since they are signs of disrespect, and I don't think that's an asperger thing only. Perhaps I should just accept them and lower my worth.

I see people manipulating girls and getting them hooked, and honestly sometimes I wish I could do that but I think I am way too good with girls given my empathetic side, I have very smart friends who are cold and calculating, I am a very weird example of someone who is sensitive and calculating.

I have been alone all my life, I felt left behind by mi family, my friends, and many many potential partners. I have given up the chance to be happy with my current self,  because every setback deepens the trauma and the feeling that something is wrong within me that makes me unlovable.

After failing countless times, all of which have hurt so so bad, I realized I am trying to get the love my mother didn't give me from a partner.  My last attempt is to try to get my parents to work out our situation. I am not sure if it's gonna work. A month ago a girl I was hoping to get into a relationship with cut with me and I have cried every day since, I feel like my life is a loop where I feel good when a potential partner appears which usually lasts a month and then I feel terrible after it eventually ends for four or more months. This is no way to live.

I am thinking of leaving the country taking advantage of my remote work, and start over a new life. I know people will suggest I should try to fight and fix my problems, but I have tried all my life and failed. Everyday I see signs that bring back traumatic memories and make me cry for hours.

I want to ""die"", metaphorically, meaning i want to forget everything that happened here forcefully and begin fresh trying to forget my traumas. I will try this until I am 30. If it doesn't work, I am trying to come to terms that I should end my life. I would never have kids with these depressive episodes, they don't deserve that.  I have had phases where I considered suicide throughout my life, but I don't know, this time it feels different, I just feel I am close to exhausting all the options I had.

Perhaps a good way to visualize the sadness I feel is listening a song I made for the last ""almost relationship"" (how I hate that combination of words) I had:

"Has anyone else noticed this pattern among the men and women members of the show, series, Love On The Spectrum? This is a pattern that i've noticed about that series, and i believe other people observe it too, it seems that the typical female, woman member of the show, series, has dated plenty or had plenty of boyfriends before, or has had at least 1 long term boyfriend in her life.

But the typical, not all, but majority of the male members of the show, have never had a girlfriend before, never dated, or have just dated very little in their life, maybe a short-term relationship or something. 

It does feel and look like a cruel difference, but at the same time, i figure it should not be a shock or a surprise as to why its like that.

I don't like it but its just part of nature, the world, reality, being cruel at times in many areas of life.",1
"Could how parents raise a child with autism affect how well they function? I know there’s a spectrum and everything, but I was wondering if some of the more problematic effects of autism could be magnified by parents who see autism as more of a problem than a unique difference raise their child.

I’ve heard some of the stories of “autism moms” being awful in how they raise them, and it sounds like their children are often the ones with worse symptoms.

My parents didn’t even know I had Aspergers and raise me normally and were overall patient, and I turned out pretty smart and capable of sustaining myself unless very stressed out.

Could poor raising have drastic effects on the symptoms of autism that last to adulthood?",1

"What counts as ""bottoms""? I asked a question to one of my support workers lastweek, about what im allowed to wear in my own home when support staff are with me in my home. It gets very hot in the summer now, and I do not do well with heat. So to cope I wear as little clothing as I can to stay cool. 

I asked my support worker what they were comfy with me wearing (they basically said as long as I am wearing underwear it dosnt bother them).

But today I got a letter that reads:

""Please can we ask that when a support worker arrives, you need to have on a top and bottoms on - that covers your genital area adequatley. This is to protect the welfare of both Support staff and you. If you are not correctly attired, we would be unable to support you that day.""

What counts as ""bottoms"" though? Its about as clear as mud to me. Underwear? Technically covers my genital area. Just trousers/jeans? 

And ""protect the welfare of support staff"" what does that even mean!? What do they think I do when support are with me! 

A few times when support staff have been in my home, I have been wearing nothing but a top and underwear. Never heard anything negative from anyone about it, staff never told me to put anything else on. Ive been topless in shorts with them in my house before, again no issues from anyone about it. A couple times I have even been wearing nothing BUT underwear when it was 35c inside my house! no one said a thing about it negative or otherwise. 

Im waiting to hear back from them about the letter, cos I dont understand it much. And im not overy keen on what they are insinuating with the whole ""welfare"" statement either. 

What do you think it all means? Im very confused about it and, a bit annoyed really. Its MY house that THEY come into.....and no member of staff has ever said anything negative to me about it. Never told me to go put something else on or told me off for it either. So like................wha",1
"Concept maps, graph theory, and learning styles A big breakthrough moment for me was realizing that I learned things differnetly. My mother called it ""learning the hard way"" and initially that's how I saw it, until I realized it was more nuanced than that, in that I needed to understand something from base principles for it to make any sense, and that I sucked at learning just from memory. 

Fast-forward many years and I'm still fascinated by the hows and whys of this, and coming across this subreddit brought a load of new questions that were salient to me that relate to this issue.

Today I was reading up on graph theory which lead to learning about ""concept maps"". This stuck a chord with me in relation to how I like to map out information in my learning methods, and so I wondered whether this would be particularly useful to those on ASD spectrum. Sure enough there is a study on it. For anyone interested:

I don't really want to get diagnosed though, I've heard it's pretty difficult especially if you're somewhat older.

"I was offered a major promotion at work, but I feel I will never reach hapiness, no matter how much effort I put into my life At age 32 I finally found a workplace that I didn't completely hated.

Not that I don't deserve it working so hard, but I thought it would take at least two more years before being considered and maybe not even then due to me being autistic.

But here I am, I will be in charge for 150 people. I was very excited and proud. I am somewhat nervous, but I want to take this chance.

Few hours later though, dark thoughts creeped back in. I was thinking how much effort and positivity I put into all my life and yet can't find one woman that would want to spend time with me. I went on another first date just 4 days before all that, again rejected.

"Anyone relate to this work pattern? When I look back at my life, I realize I never held a job longer than two years. 

It hit me recently that I tend to follow this particular unique pattern and am really curious if any of you can relate. Here it goes:

I jump in with both feet and really enjoy learning the ins and outs of a new job. This phase is by far my favorite. I tend to go above and beyond and love the learning curve. It’s like solving an exciting puzzle. I am entirely focused on it and soak it up. 

At this stage, socially I enjoy getting to know people and it’s like a honeymoon stage. 

At around the 8 month mark, once I get all the logistics down and the learning phase ends, things seem to take a drastic turn. I start to struggle with boredom and resulting mental anguish. I also start to notice petty office politics more and more, and they start to cause me immense stress and burnout. 

At this stage, I try to be friendly with everyone, make excuses for their behavior, try even harder to please and do nice gestures to try to protect myself from the stresses of office politics and often arbitrary cattiness. At this point I still have faith in people and internalize blame more and more. 

About a year into my job, I am starting to feel extremely bitter and disillusioned. The many arbitrary, nonsensical rules that are inefficient (I generally speak up about these respectfully and try to change them systematically, most often with small to no success) are completely wearing me down. 

Having observed patterns of dynamics for a while at this point, I soak up everyone‘s feelings and pick up on the smallest dishonesties and dynamics and can predict people’s behaviors to the T. Everyone else seems to be blind to this and it’s painful to see them walk around manipulated and buying into dynamics without seeing the writing on the wall. 

It also becomes a lonely and harrowing experience, (I don’t know how else to explain it) but picking up lying and overall dynamics and predicting things accurately no one else seems to is lonely and intense. It’s almost like I have X Ray vision for the ugly hidden motives and don’t want to - like seeing the cancers in everyone that walks by and it tainting everything and not being able to get it out of my mind. 

It’s hard to explain, because I can be oblivious to certain things more than the average person yet can pick up on dishonesty and scheming and predict certain outcomes way more than the average person. 

By a year and a half, I am utterly exhausted and burned out by it all. The lack of learning new things is demoralizing and it also leaves way too much room for my attention to absorb the above. It’s almost like focusing on new intellectual challenges (besides them being immensely rewarding) also protects me from having bandwidth to absorb the politics bs.

By the end of two years I am a shell of myself. Utterly physically and emotionally exhausted. Feels like my “skin” is raw and dealing with office politics is acid poured over it. I just want to run away and be a hermit, be at home in a cocoon reading and gardening and getting away from all the corrupt BS. It’s like other people let it all roll off their back with a thick skin but it destroys me.

I have generally been successful in grad school and praised at my jobs (though also picked on and bullied by some), but I can’t seem to avoid the above. 

I have been home for almost a year since my last job (on disability for other health issues) and I am just slowly recovering from the profound burn out it caused me. 

Can anyone relate? Any thoughts and general feedback? Any tips or coping tools you might be able to share?

Thank you so much for listening and am excited to hear from you!",1
"Making friends for me is simple enough and doable, but maintaining friendships is practically impossible I keep getting bombarded with social media posts about the importance of making friends, so that's what brings me here. 

First of all, I've already learned how to make good first impressions, build rapport, get the other person to talk about themselves and find common interests. Sure, I don't have Austin Powers levels of charm, but I can make friends about as well as the next guy. 

But I can't keep friends for very long. Which in turn makes me stop wanting to make friends in the first place, because I know that I'm probably going to end up getting overworked by the friendship and have to end it. I get so tired out from the energy that goes into friendships that it feels like a second job. Sometimes, it feels like a third job, because dealing with my comorbidities feels like I'm managing a big and hectic project in my mind. 

How do you autistics here manage to maintain friendships? Is there any way to decrease the mental load? Anything at all that you share can be a huge source of help. Shout out to all the other autistics on here who are dealing with the same thing",1
"What is your opinion on prenatal screening for autism? I see a lot of discussion and debate happening regarding neurotypicals but very little to nothing about the near future of prenatal testing and the fact a routine prenatal ultrasound can identify early signs of autism.

I feel like this really does not get enough attention and is much closer to reality than many think. A future without autism could be a feasible reality if prenatal testing is done for autism.

In such a reality babies with signs of autism could technically be aborted after a positive test result. At the same time this could also be used to provide better more specific care.

What do you think about this?

"Dating Troubles(Advice needed) Hi everyone I'm new to the community, but I've been a long time lurker. I decided to make a reddit account today and make this post, so sorry if my post isn't formatted the best and is long.

**For some context:** I'm a female in my 20s, and I have aspergers and anxiety disorder. I have never dated before, but I've found myself getting more attention recently after improving myself a lot, ie: weight loss, and taking care of myself.

I've been trying to get into dating for around the last year. I've tried dating apps, but I find myself getting very anxious. I'm more of the loner type. I've only talked with around 5 guys and the pattern is the same. we chat for a few minutes, he wants to take me out and I don't feel comfortable enough to do it. Everything just seems to happen too quickly, when I need more time to get to know and be comfortable with someone. But me wanting to build up a relationship is treated like an inconvenience. I also start to realize that I'm not picking up on a lot of the social cues, when I look back it's so obvious, but in the moment I can't really see it. For example: the cashier at a local sandwich shop was obviously flirting with me, but I didn't really notice. I gave him my number, cause I genuinely thought that it would go to the owner for a job prospect. I didn't expect him to text me later on that night asking for a date.  Another huge concern is the amount of boys that are picking up on the Andrew Tate/manosphere ways of thinking, that make navigating a relationship for me even harder. It may seem like I'm overprotective of myself, but I know from the past that I can get taken advantage of very easily by others if I'm not careful. 

If I had to compare my dating life to something, I would say I'm that one girl in a dating sim that never seems to emotionally connect with the player, unless you interact with me a lot and then it clicks for me one day. But by that point most players, would have tried their hands at another girl.

I know I'm young, but I'm beginning to worry that I might not be built to have a ""normal"" relationship with someone. I would love more than anything to find a lifelong partner, but the ways things are going I'm not really sure.

I hope I was able to explain what I mean. **Is there any advice that anyone can give me to help navigating dating with aspergers a bit easier. And is there anyone else that feels the way I do?** Sometimes I do feel life I'm the only one that does. Thank you for any advice.",1

"Good life hacks for telling the difference between committing to an explicit set of tasks, versus committing to a social role, involving a complex set of explicit and unspoken obligations? As fellow people who naturally struggle at reading people, reading the room, and reading the air, I’m sure this is a life pain to which many of you relate. I can’t count the number of times it’s happened to me. A few times, the toll on my sense of wellbeing and self-worth was so unexpectedly great that I was near suicidal (getting into medicine as a career being by far the biggest and worst)

Generally it goes like this. I’ll answer a call-out for people interested in doing task X. I’ll ask a lot of probing questions about what exact steps task X involves, and what contributions toward this task are asked or expected of me. Liking these explicit terms and on paper bringing a lot to the table, I commit. Often enthusiastically, and to great first impressions.

Things go well for a short time. But then, out of seemingly nowhere, my coworkers are angry at me. Sometimes they don’t want to tell me why, or don’t think they should have to. So I approach my supervisor or immediate *senpai* in private, in the spirit of clearing up misunderstandings and setting things right. But how I describe my *modus operandi* and way of conceptualizing the duties of the work makes him/her *more* appalled, concerned, and often righteously indignant with me, rather than understanding. At worst, (s)he’s inspired to put me in my place, and tell me to FIFO.

I’m unpleasantly surprised and offput, since in my mind I’ve so far committed to and done exactly what was asked of me, no more no less. But apparently this wasn’t enough. Not *nearly* enough. The organizers, funders, and supervisors of Task X were counting on me (and all new recruits) to pick up on the fact that their explicit expectations were merely indicators of much deeper temperamental and behavioral patterns they couldn’t explicitly ask about or screen for. And, along the same lines, a whole lot expected of me (and all new recruits) was unspoken and unwritten, and not easy to anticipate or put into explicitly binding language. And the appalled reaction I’m getting, is their realization that someone passed through their filter without actually getting it or accepting it at all. At worst, I’ll find myself regarded and treated as a piece of riffraff who snuck into the party uninvited, or gamed their system for my own selfish benefit. I find this kind of reaction not only shocking but hurtful too — it was not my intention to exploit or to take on something I wasn’t qualified for. *If someone had had it in them to spell out exactly what was expected of me*, I would’ve gladly been on my way and been no trouble to anyone.

"When are we going to start having collective unity? How come we are routinely excluded, ridiculed, and targeted by neurotypical scum that sees us as walking jokes to poke fun at? Every single user on this subreddit gets bullied, excluded, heckled, and otherwise treated different and treated as subhuman.


How many of us have neurodivergent friends? I have a couple and when I met them we instantly connected in ways that I never connected with NTs. 


We connected in seconds in ways I haven't done with an NT in years.


I know the ""us vs them"" mentally is frowned upon, and I do not urge some kinda conflict between us and them. But come on, every other group of people on this planet got the idea to form a collective unity. Meanwhile, the Martin Luther Kings and Ghandis of the aspie community push us to try to get accepted by the NTs and with a little more trying love will pave the way.


Do I believe with a little more love all our troubles will end? I don't believe it. I do believe that aspies should focus on forming clubs for themselves to advocate for ourselves. Something like 70% of us go most our life unemployed. Neurotypicals routinely use nepotism to give each other decent jobs, why don't we do the same? 


The dating world is hell for us but it doesn't have to be if we had a system in place for aspies to meet other aspies.


Almost all of us get bullied in school to the point we grow up with severe psychological trauma, and those who run the schools don't want to waste resources on the 1 in 50 kids who are different. Worse, teachers usually pair us with the most disruptive students so they harass us and leave the rest of the class alone, using us like a bait dog in a dog fighting club. 


When are we going to control our own schools? This whole ""community"" thing results in ""community"" coming together against us it seems. It's time for the aspie community to be separate in the areas where it's appropriate.


For your greatest aim to be getting accepted by the NTs is to say you'll only have meaning in life if people who hate us will give us a meaning in life. 


It's high time we start having stronger collective identity. Because the alternative is, we continue getting murdered, raped, abused, and pushed into suicide. 


The way people of some racial groups accuse you of being against them if you vote the wrong way, we need to normalize a narrative against NTs of the like ""if you don't support us having separate institutions then you must truly hate all the neurodivergent."" 


Every other group of people that was treated different, for being different, got it into their head they are different and should associate different. When will we?

The neurotypicals already identify us as different enough they feel justified in separating us from them. They're right. We are instantly identifiable as different and should associate with ourselves more close. No more seeking acceptance of them as the highest goal. They don't wanna accept us, get it through your head!",1

I thought things were going well. I was talking to someone in my family and we started talking about our days and what we wanted to do tomorrow. Then at one point I forgot to listen to the other person and started talking A LOT. Then it got to be so much that I interrupted them and they got visibly annoyed. “Okay I don’t care. STOP. LISTEN to what I’m saying.”

It felt like I got punched in the gut with a wave of shame. It was so bad. I apologized, excused myself, and cried in the restroom for half an hour afterwards. I felt like a total fool. I humiliated myself, interrupted someone, and they probably think I’m either a dumbass or rude. 

I got too excited and didn’t want to pause the conversation and forgot to take turns talking.

"I know masturbation is healthy but I dont want or like to do it. My therapist was shocked that i dont do it and i hate sex and relationships due to being bullied in school, i dont feel anything from masturbation as a woman, only boredom and I hate my self for that &#x200B;

it seems everyone else on here is hypersexual and stims from it, i even read about people mastrubating on public places or talking about it with their parents, each time my dad brought the topic up i screamed, disgusting. And that comes from a person who changes the diapers of my ill mother which has cancer and currently cant walk. Ive been hated by boys most of my life past 4th grade, feeling unwanted and being eww-ed at and being told i am disgusting, eventually my hygiene suffered so much and i started to smell and i never had problems washing ever in my life or washing my teeth, I was so depressed that i found it hard to move and being silent and suffering silently after reporting the abuse so much made me self harm. I struggle with everyone else on here describing in huge detail what they do with their organ or how it feels when i barely have any attraction to anyone and hate being touched. Guys made me feel small and weak or rejected and ignored me so why should i be attracted to anyone if they only like hoey mean sassy girls. I cant imagine having sex due to my severe hatred for physical touch but honestly hearing how it is a stress relief and everyone else feels pleasure while i am in constant pain, living in the past and trying not to oof my self makes me unhappy, as well as the fact that the most toxic and nasty people usually are in relationships. I hate how parents talk about it with their kids as if its something normal, I would probably run to another country than ever talk about sex, erotica brings me joy to read but what i like hypothetically/theoretically doesnt exist irl,

I do find anime guys attractive but that might be cause they wouldn't abuse and reject me, technically a lot of guys wouldnt either but i wouldnt find them attractive. I find most guys cringy and most guys want one thing, sex. Ive been called abnormal, crazy and many other words for simply denying sex or saying i look for a relationship. Even if the guy is normal he demands a lot of hugs and I hate how people see me as innocent sheltered virgin because i cant find a boyfriend. I dont understand relationships or how they start. But I was told I will die alone a lot which also makes me biased, i see it as a weird social milestone just like sex but i dont understand why is it important. I dont know how well I will do in a relationship since every girl and guy i know has had a few exes, some of which are druggies. I had my first kiss at a ""normal age"" but I get my driver's license at a much older age than appropriate cause i have to, the whole concept of virginity is weird to me because some guys sexualize me and want ""a pure woman"" even though they had 20 partners and probably have stds, just lieke the first guy to kiss me and give me herpes, not worth it cause he left me for dead and had a few girlfriends which made me never talk to him cause he did drugs and was creepy and annoying to me, whether i like someone or breathe i was made fun of so i dont know what type of guy would want me, a lot of people find me both annoying and boring and I am sometimes mute due to years of abuse and spend a lot of time alone. And sex is about communicatio nand boundaries, the other guys dont want an inexperienced woman that doesnt know what she wants and think i am a big red flag since where i live people date at 12-13 and i am about to end college with no experience at all which means I am abnormal and defective...when I see people in relationships i cant deduce what they have that i dont but they surely arent nice or smart, thats for sure.

Tinder/badoo is horribl but guys irl are just a bit less vulgar versions of what the guys there are. I know what I like but i just dont see it in my country and idk if i will want someone outside of my country, most guys randomly ask me about blowjobs, how many exes I had or talk to me for hours about each one of their exes on chat or on date and force me to listen, or tell me I am xrazy for not wanting sex or ask me if i ever had sex and when i say what kind of question is that they passive agressively say maybe not. I clearly stated in my bio that i dont look for sex and yet they clearly dont read or care, why is it so common guys to ask about sex so casually or talk about their ex, am I supposed to be nice with them and symparthize? Kind of an overreaction to insult a random girl cause she doesnt wan tto do it with you (I live in eastern europe, so) I feel really ashamed for my struggling social life and lack of romantic one, i think guys are creepy and out of all of the dates i went out with only 2 guys made me feel normal and didnt insult me or talk about their exes or sex or ask me if i like them after one hour convo.

 I know sex double standarts exist but you cant have 10 ex partners and expect a virgin girl, thats unrealistic, i am not abstinent or religious but i sometiems say i am because it is better than explaining asexual which makes people look at me as if I have 3 heads since lgbtq is really taboo where i live and i was called trans lesbian simply for not showing off my bra and being sassy mean type of girl, which most girls are, and i kinda stick out. If i am girly girl i just get sexual comments from older men but men my age clearly dont want me and i dont want them back because it is frustrating and scary to talk to the hostile and clearly ""rational"" male gender, i pretend to laugh at their jokes like a normal fake girl but i cant care. I never thought i had a type but it seems i like the same type of man in anime/korean manhwa and books and do have a strong preference, despite being 21 most guys are just boys who only want sex,nothing serious and are extremely immature and clearly arent ND which is horrible, i wont say marry me thats too early and a big commitment, and i know sex is big part of people's lives which scares me, the whole dead bedrooms and having sex on honeymoon and getting pregnant and giving birth is horrible and yucky to me, i honestly cant sympathize and hate that i must go through this so i can be ""a normal woman"" I know sex should be pleasureable but if it is anything like my masturbation, not feeling anything or boring i honestly would prefer to play games in my phone, i know sex makes you moan and all but porn makes me fall asleep, its like a weird moaning movie, id rather watch fantasy or comedy, and i do read a lot of erotica, idk why but most people portray sex as something horrible and i am biased due to my bullying and sensory issues, but in books and anime it is something intimate and beautiful, even though that sounds cringy i dont know how some people do it daily, id rather cut off my genitalia and die than have sex every day with a man, I struggle to imagine living with a man in general.

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. I thought og buying sex toys but living wiht my ill barely moving mother isnt really getting me into the mood, i do have sexy panties and clothes like latex and leather but they just help me not die and feel confident and not like the trash tumor my male classmates treated me as, i like the anime/book men that i like because i can be honest and feel like a woman when i watch them/read about them, with real men they are either creepy, immature, pervy (first pick up line in chat is - do you touch your self) also had a 50 year old man roam around my high school and asked me that at the age of 14 also where i live, so i stopped using the bus, and generally unpleasant to be around and those that are ""normal and social and attractive"" would never want an annoying boring weird girl like me, the constant jokes that i watch hentai and am kinky hurt me since in reality i look for security and pleasure since i have chronic pains and cry a lot but the other girls arent obsessed with sex becasue they already get it and have boyfriends so them liking anime/korean manga/erotic books and them trying it with their husbands deeply disturbs me but if i say that I am ""trying to control two consenting adults's behavior"" my emotions were never important and i spent most of my life being shouted at for ever having an opinion or expressing my emotions which left me mute, i still however think i am allowed to have an opinion and be my self and learn to be assertive. Ive been pushed and hit and had my things ruined and the teachers didnt care and sometimes it became worse, i never had a life where i felt safe and since it wasnt physical no one cared, so yeah I am allowed to take space ,and breathe oxygen especially since i dont hit or hurt or scream at anyone, but since this is the internet anyone can tell everyone else the most horrible things and feel like a winner, i dont think it is psychologically normal to read things not meant for you, but for horny single audience and try it wiht your partner, go try porn and masturbate together why dont you?

I strongly believe that there is no such thing as objective social skills. Aspies and NTs communicate differently and there is nothing inherently right or wrong about both.

"I just had my first ""fight"" with my girlfriend and it felt really terrible [rant] We've been together for 1,5 years now and this was the first time it happened. I use the word fight loosely as it was mostly just her being mad and berating me for several minutes straight while I sat there trying to understand what she was trying to tell me

We were having a movie night at her house and I was 5 minutes late to it as I was finishing up a board game session I was having with the boys (I double booked but managed anyway). Just a few minutes after our set time I texted her apologizing saying I was going to be a bit late as I was finishing up something. I didn't think much of it because both of us tend to be a little late to our meet ups every now and them. She texted me back saying she was sleepy and I again texted her apologizing and saying I would be there as fast as I can. She texted me again and we then texted a bit back and forth and she seemed like she didn't want to meet anyway that night and I became very unsure, she was being very vague and weird and I waited a while before going to her house because I honestly didn't know if she wanted me to come over or if she had changed her mind, and she didn't tell me. But after some back and forth I got an answer from her and she told me to come over.

When I came over she started berating me and especially hammering down the fact about how rude it is to be late to things etc. I said I was just 5 minutes late, but she said I was 20 minutes late, which was true, but that was because I thought she canceled our night so I wasn't sure. When I tried to explain this or ask questions to make sense of what she was saying and to make sure I understood her, she got even more mad and said things like ""You just don't understand, do you?"" and things like that, like she was belittling me. And I didn't know what to really do or make of the situation, I never fight or argue with people, I believe every problem can be solved peacefully, but she was having none of it. So I just kind of sat there and took it until she finished, not engaging in it at all, not even saying sorry or apologizing. It made me feel very vulnerable and embarrassed.

She said she wasn't mad at me, just mad, so mad she forgot the story she wanted to tell me. So I helped her jog her memory, and she told me about the story she wanted to tell and we had a normal conversation, even though she was still acting very moody. Then we we watched a movie, cuddled, flirted and had a nice normal chat before I went home a few hours later. She apologized to me for being mad and misunderstanding me and after I left she also texted me and apologizing for getting mad and misunderstanding. And I just told her it's okay and that I'm not mad or anything, even though I felt a bit hurt from the way she belittled me, but I don't know what else to really say.

Is this... normal? This is the first real relationship I've been in so it's quite new to me. She doesn't have autism, but I do and she knew that from when we first met. If this happens again should I just let her get it out? If I'm not mistaken I thing these things are emotional rather than a logical, so trying to be logical doesn't work",1
"I don’t want to be in a foreign country for almost 3 weeks. My husband wants to go visit his family in his home country for 18 days and I am terrified. Even being away from my home and routine for 5 days makes me feel horrible and anxious. I don’t want to. I tell my husband please can I only go for 1/2 of the time, and he won’t accept it. He gets extremely mad and tells me that I am being a bad wife basically. I try to tell him that I am not mentally like a ‘normal’ person, I want to be but I am not. He even gets mad at me mentioning that I am worried I will have no where to retreat and be alone while we are there with his family. 
I feel so misunderstood and unsupported by him all of the time. It makes me just not want to go at all. At this point I can tell he is not going to be an emotional support for me while we are there, so WHY would I put myself in that position???
Everytime he starts to ask me about the flights I voice my concerns and he gets mad and tells me I am preventing him from buying the tickets to visit his family. 
He wants me to just go along with it and act like everything is going to be great. I know that I’m going to have a ton of struggles because we went for 10 days in the past and it felt almost like torture to me. 
Coming back home I felt more drained from being in that foreign country than if I just worked my job like usual. Aren’t vacations supposed to refresh you? 
I have no one in my family or friends to talk to about it because they don’t understand how I could possibly be feeling any kind of fear or anxiety about going to a foreign country for this long. I feel so alone. 
Do any of you have advice for me. I need help. I don’t know what to do. 
I feel these are my options:

A. Act like it’s going to be fine and go for the entire trip with my husband and deal with whatever happens when it happens. 

B. Be firm and tell him I am only going for 1/2 the time (even this will be stressful but about 50% less stressful than the 18 days). 

C. Tell him I am not going at all. This will cause his family and him to be extremely upset but he is unsupportive whenever I mention the 1/2 duration idea. 

Thank you if you read this. My husband and I already have a lot and I mean A LOT of issues. Our marriage is not exactly on solid ground. I’m not only uncomfortable about the routine and environment change but I’m uncomfortable about having to be around his family who I feel is going to be judging me and treating me strangely.",1

"I need help understanding my feelings 37M High support Autism/Aspergers

I got diagnosed in 2011, my parents organised the diagnoses for me. Got a job shortly after, which I held for 8 years, got made redundant, got a new job 2 weeks later, have been at new job for 5 years.

I am perfectly happy in this job, I was not looking for another one, due to the fact that I hate change, and need essentially a same shit different day mentality/sense of routine to keep me focused, committed and calm.

I can't stress this enough I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB AT ALL!!!!

My mom surprises me out of nowhere, saying she has found the perfect job for me, potentially a lot more money (in reality probably not after taxes lets face it) it's in the public sector, which being that I am Australian, somehow means I can never be fired (don't know/understand how that works) and could potentially be a better environment for me. Plus it is in a field I am very familiar with and, not to brag, I am probably over qualified for.

However, I would be giving up every thing that I have built over the last 5 years to start all over again.

They include,

I have no helicopter monitoring, I can disappear for ages and no one comes looking for me.

I do all my tasks efficiently, well and properly.

I can wear whatever I want.

I leave on time, everyday and come in late and no one says shit.

I am fully autonomous, even in my team environment.

Even though there is no career progression i don't care about that.

It took ages, but my team, and the company understood my autism/asperger diagnoses and daily requirements, they respect it and leave me alone.

I just feel at the moment, like I am going to get this new position but to leave all the good I have at the moment and what I have built to essentially start all over again, is stressing me out. 

Especially when the decision wasn't mine to begin with, my mom suggested this to me, as something that is too good to not go for, an offer I can't refuse/give up, and I am the one that essentially has to pull the trigger on something that I NEVER WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!",1

"Is there any reason in particular why society hates certain traits that are exact symptoms of aspergers, while bpd, ocd and others can corelate to asperger it seems society hates certain traits in people in both men and women, I find dating to be horrible as a woman so I want to talk on a global scale since probably 9/10 of people here will be american but i want to talk about places like korea/japan where people with asperger are heavily hated, eastern europe which shames mental health and lgbtq and seems it as defective (where i am from) So like in my experience all of my life as a little girl (im sorry if this post should be on aspergirls instead but i wanted both male and female perspective) ive been told certain things - to not be part of the ""the crazy"" as we call them, usually people seem to refer to schizophrenia and other illnesses they are afraid of and dont understand but autist is actually a big heavy insult where i live. So is the mentally slow word starting with R which scares americans so much .I dont budge an eye since i hear it and other insults daily, not really aimed at me even though ive been told to die here and there. So basically there are certain milestones which everyone gets at certain age, like first kiss, first boyfriend, tattoos/piercings, driver's license which everyone gets at 18, I get it now at 21 since my father is dead and no one can drive my mum to the hospital, i also hate guys since no one on purpose from my class drove me to home so i had to freeze on bus stops and wait for a bus for at least 40 hours, since I am ""disgusting""

 and apperently being near me and breathing near me is a nuisance and I am horrible. I've been abused quite a lot in school which made me give up on education especially since i didnt get good grades in high school. I wasnt allowed to cry or be angry even when abused because that would fuel the abuse so i became mute but that made me even more depressed ot the point of self harm. I know the school shooter is popular trope in america but where i live it doesnt exist. I just knew one thing - Those ugly stinky forever alone men (I didnt know what asperger was or that it could exist in women when i was a child) that constantly watch anime and play video games...dont be one of them, dont befriend them, same with bullied people but idk why, i was the most bullied out of my both classes and kill me, shoot me, burn me , pay me money - i cant tell you why. First I was too girly and sissy in middle school and annoying and then in high school i was too quiet, weird, boring and anxious and the abuse grew since i was quiet but if i reacted or responded it wasnt better, and it was more verbal and social which ruined me mentally since middle school was more someone ruining my stuff. I hate being alone now and sitting alone since i am afraid i will be abused if i am 0.1 seconds alone.

...and i love my alone time. Lack of verbal conversatiosn and friends and constant criticism made me isolate my self and people....probably saw me as unferiendly. However i did the same to other groups and wasnt bullied. I clearly am not the problem but i do behaviors that i am not aware of that attract abuse. I was hit quite a lot by balls during pe and once in the girlschanging room so now i hate anything sports related, especially guys since it is guys that abused me. Why is bad hyigene/anime/video games so deeply related to asperger? Why is being alone and friendless being seen as miserable, i was never miserable being aloen, i was being miserable when someone shouted at me and touched me or hit me or humiliated me so the whole class laughed at me...i was also isolated and gossiped about so finding friends is hard, I do try to be friendly but since even my own mum gossiped on me i struggle to trust anyone since especially in school any info people had about me they used it against me, they were never curious, they just loved to make me cry and were cruel which is why i hate relationships and sex now. It seems many guys are lonely but no one talks about lonely girls since girls cant be lonely by default. No one sympathizes with girls problems since ""they can get sex"" easily but it doesnt mean we are happy. Ive been threateend on tinder and badoo by guys asking me where i live since i said that i am a virgin and dont want sex, and most guys have had sex in their teens and concider me abnormal. Ive been told i am disgusting by guys and eww-ed at and was seen as undesireablr and no one wanting to sit with me, talk to me

 be on a school trip with me which made me hate anything feminine and my self but the masculine didnt save me either, i was called trans, lesbian, shouted at when i smiled and it is still a wonder why i avoid eye contact and am mute. I never washed every day but my hyigene suffered as a result of the abuse and as you can guess everything is my fault and i am disgusting even whe ni wash with 3 shampoos and wear a perfume. Anything i did or liked was villanized while even loser guys who liked anime and video games prefered the mean girls, if i ever isulted back its like in their mind they confirm their bias that I am a horrible person that must die and was apperently ""a pick me"" for not being sassy mean girl that likes make up, i am much mroe girly now but it doesnt mean i get along or understand girls better and i dont want it to seem like the bullying won and made me ""normal"" aka not tomboy. I dont want ot be submissive wife type but i hate the loud mean girls so i am trying to find my own voice which was taken away from me, i found it hard to breathe in school and couldnt concentrate on my studies unlike i nmiddle school where the abuse was more different and i could awkwardly laugh even when hit, but in high school i started caring too much, couldnt stop, cried a lot due to hormonal disbalance and couldnt leave my house in fear of being bullied, i struggle to ""ignore "" words or actions

 once said and if i do they usually escalate even if i report them, i was somehow seen as a spineless toy to toy around with even when i was sviicdial and self harmed but if i did something drastic i wouldnt have had support and would have been kicked out and have had problems, so i cojstantly said in cold tone, i dont care/go away because i couldnt care less and everything inside my body burnt and hurt and i couldnt eat, sleep or breathe, my face was yellow. They ruined my life and werent even punished and the damned conceler told me and my parents that i should move on, i dont know if ishould have talked to the principial since the guys that bullied me didnt see me as a human, let alone a woman since i wasnt mean and had friends. It seems iti okay to be quiet if you have friends, there was this guy paet of the video game gang that never talked but no one bullied him, but since i am alone somehow my behavior ""sticks out"" and it is unaccapatable. Ironically when i tried to talk I was ignored or told to shut up, most of the time and my bullies constantly tried to ruin my day in small ways, even on our prom and last day with our teacher the guys foguht to not sit near me or be near me which made me cry, because it is psychologically abnormal at the old age of 18 to fight to not be near a girl, guys do that at 8-9 age cause girls have ""cooties"" but the age where everone has lovers and likes each other, being disliked platonically and romantically and people not wanting anytihng to do with you and having this weird opinion that you are disgusting without any evidence...that hurts. Ive never smelled or went to school badly looking to deserve such a bad nickname, which i had even in middle school but it made me stop washing my teeth to the point whee i had many cavities and smelled a lot. Idk if these boys are sissy but having big muscles and abusing little girls with anorexia doesnt make you manly, i clearly couldnt hit back physically with a ball let alone verbally with words so fighting a girl as a gang of guys is bizzare, guys show strength and status by fighting each other.

...fighting a girl indirectly is ....kinda weak. I dont like guys and see relationships and sex as negative because of them, and yet I am the ""loser"" for being a virgin and not having dating experience and being seen as a red flag despite being a woman cause society says so. Guys only talk about blowjobs and how many exes they had or they ask me how many exes i had, i went to many dates but about 2 guys only treated me good and listened to me in convo, idk how or why is it normal, one guy even told me he looks for replacement for his ex and not a real gf, but 9/10 guys just want sex, friends with benefits, one night stands and call me crazy since how can i dare to deny them.  I dont feel safe with guys since the topic of sex always comes on and the lgbtq is heavily stigmatized so using the word asexual or saying i have asperger is off the table, since i will be part of the crazy. I also hope i wouldnt be registered somewhere since if you have mental illness similar to shciozoprenia you cant drive a car, adopt a child, etc and jobs dont really accept you. Similar ot how i dont say i have a mother wiht cancer that cant walk or else i wont be hired, so people saying - i am glad i am not in OP's country make me livid.  I know hygiene is basic and normal but i am tired of ever sharing my abuse be seen as whining while others whine about lack of wifi/fake nails/homework.

No one cares and i wont share but if i never share anything about my self i am seen as suspicious and people treat me badly. Ive read a lot of self help books and a lot or articles on how to better my social skills but it seems it is not me who has bad social skills, you cant be offended that i dont look you in the eye for 0.3 seconds and call me rude. And this whole ""you're weird thing"" I wish people told me what makes me so much weird so i can erase it since it creates problems in my relationships and makes people wary of me, all i know is that i smile and am polite and should be more assertive since it somehow translates to - come abuse me, i am defensless !- idk why, so i am also cold amd emotionless and it seems to do the job of ""assertiveness"" or whatever, quite well. I used to be big on empathy but if i find it hard to sympathize with anyone right now and life is a bit easier this way. I also struggle when i read posts from guys on here and i have one good friend from new york whose brother has some form of autism and she was very offended that i told her that he is usleess since he cant work...well she mentioned that all women should burn in hell because they dont want to suck him, so there is that. I also know a guy wiht severe autism which hits his parents and siblings and screams and pisses him self and as 8 year old i couldnt explain what was wrong with him so i hated him...the other boys dont hit me, so why does he? I made a post about the guy a long time ago and peoople just hated me in the comments and wished me i have children with autism. I didnt know what autism was but i ust knew that he had it and it must relate to physical abuse, i didnt even know someon with autism could talk, how can i not hate him? I read a lot and it seems there are many similiarites among girls with asperger and me, but it seems guys with autism dont really act like the guy that i know that beats other people up which is helpful information. I know america has these awareness weeks/days but where i live such things are strictly taboo and not talked about, we barely talk about periods and sex, let alone mental health and lgbtq. 

&#x200B;

It seems every group that is hated, furries, 4chan/redditors, anime fanatics/weebs tthe type that have bodypillows, video game maniacs that dont leave chair and have virtual waifus, fujoshis - they all seem to connect back to asperger and i want to ask - why do people hate them so much, not everyone can be ""cool"" and change their girlfriend/boyfriend every year, not everyone can have abs/big breasts and always say the right thing and not be neurotic, so why hate and entire group of people and their traits and villanize them as if they have cancer. Everything ive been told from a young age not to be, anime fan, video game fan, forever alone perso nthat doenst wash - ibecame, and those people are the most hated, as far as I know even p3dos that are chased dont get so much bad rep or at least arent talked about as the local weird person in everyone's group that no one likes and excluded and makes fun of because apperently roasting someone especially in school is an important skill and so is conformism to the point where you are never your self and being loud and mean and somehow having friends and not losing them, its a mystety to me why i have friends and lose them, usualy they change cities or schools but sometimes they leave me and i dont know why, its ""clear"" but if i ask i am just stared at, so i avoid verbal conversations which makes me even more weird and ""anti social"" (asocial) in people's eyes, but when I try to speak I am told to shut up, when I smile i am screamed at why do i smile but if i dont i get called depressed and other words. While hygieen is important it seems people dont hate so much anime as they hate the people, ive had anime guy fans in my class and no one bullied them is it because they smoked like many other people or is it social skills or something else that i miss? I like how people feel judged by you or just simply dislike you and excuse their physical and verbal abuse by pushing you and telling you to die and thart you are weird but you cant even scream and protest and you must endure years of abuse since they get a kick by kicking people out and reporting doesnt work and you deserve to get education as much as everyone else but apperently arent allowed to exist, because a gorup of people think you are lame, annoying, boring and weird which means you should go. Its kinda weird because cheating or not they got better grades than me and i was a nerd...so why hate me for studying, i mean you got what you want right? You also party and have friends so why hate on me for not having what you have? Its like i wasnt even seen as a human let alone a woman, and there is only one way to be a woman - heterosexual, feminine, mean, sassy. I was just not that therefore i dont deserve respect, many think i am weird but some just avoid me which is why bullying is so bizzare, some stopped bullying me but it didnt feel like  a win it felt more like pity which i hate",1

"I’ve lost my ability to mask and I’m trying to get it back! As a young kid and teenager my way of masking was to barely speak and go with the flow to not draw attention to myself. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it failed. 

As a 31 year old I’ve lost this ability. I can’t always go with the flow. I can’t be timid and meek to get by, adults expect other adults to talk and interact in more complex ways with them. Short “yes” and “no”s don’t satisfy people anymore.

Now it’s like I CAN’T mask worth a shit anymore. I don’t know what to say, where to stand, how to make proper eye contact without making things weird, or how to hold a conversation that doesn’t immediately end.

Idk how to get this ability back. I never really honed it all too well to begin with, but it’s especially hard to get away with odd social behaviors as an adult!",1

"Are there any well-summarized and actionable books specifically for individuals with ""high-functioning"" autism? I consider myself a very long-term focused and patient person but even someone like me is feeling defeated. I just want a book that goes like ""how to succeed in life with specifically high-functioning autism"". With thorough career, business, social, communication, dating, community etc. advice.

I've developed a mask desperately through my childhood and I'm 25 now. It takes interacting with me in an uncontrolled setting for 5-10 minutes to tell that ""something"" is ""off"". In a controlled setting, I can hide it for days to weeks, or minimize it over months. I always end up ""unmasked"" eventually.

Therapy has been a crap shoot. If anything, therapy is the prime environment for masking. It's a one-on-one controlled setting. It couldn't be easier besides some anxiety or over eagerness to share. Also, every resource I look into is for someone with full-blown autism or for people who are neurotypical.

I need a new system. Something I can adopt to adapt to my circumstances. When I read a book or look for advice and it tells me to ""just be social"" or ""get therapy"" I don't even feel annoyed anymore. I just laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Living with this as an adult is honestly like a fever dream.

I can force myself to cope with eventually living alone, working remotely and making just barely six figures, and then dying alone. It won't be easy but that's a very REAL possibly and if I have no choice, I'll ruthlessly accept it and take it one challenge at a time.

BUT, I want MORE for myself. I want to advance in my career and salary, I want to make those moves, I want to have a healthy support system in the long-run and as I reach old age, I want to challenge myself by addressing what IS within my control to live a very long and healthy life.

I need to get this figured out ASAP. Even if I'm fucking crawling on the floor and everyone else is walking. I will fucking crawl my way to where I want in life. But I need to learn the best way to crawl.",1

"Hate Sudden Schedules I don't know why I hate it so much but I just can't stand something being scheduled or asked to be scheduled with almost no notice. Like when it comes to friends, if a friend asks if I want to hang out with them that day or the next day, I will almost always say no or if I am forced into it I will be in an annoyed mood the entire time but if we planned on hanging out a few days later then I am completely fine with it. Same applies to work, like if I am asked to come in the next day for overtime or I am called that day to work a shift I don't work then I always say no but if extra shifts were scheduled I would be fine with it.

I do hate feeling like this because it makes my friendships and other daily occurrences awkward. Like if something takes the whole day up that is what I get annoyed about but if I was suddenly asked if I wanted to go out just for lunch or something that takes like 1-2 hours then I am completely fine with it.

"(Usually) Poor recollection. At age 30, I still can't discern what is happening with my memory. Officially diagnosed with ASD only two years ago, so still learning about how I work.I work in the design field, and love to work alone, but in order to expand my prospects and onboard clients, the people in the position I'm looking to move towards are great talkers. I did a music degree so I can perform publicly, my issue is I forget what I know. It doesn't matter how many podcasts or interviews I listen to on design, architecture, history, manufacturing processes etc  and read and re-read the books, the moment I try to explain anything, my mind goes to mush.Same if explaining the plot to a movie - even one I only just saw.I'm 99% sure I don't have a brain injury (not that I can prove anything either way) I think its just a quirk of how my brain works.

Example:

My partner of two years (40s) has a complex job role, and we both usually work from home (and we love to work in the same room together). I couldn't count the hours of talking about his job, the intricacies, and all the business calls that have happened in my presence (and I ask a lot to understand), but if you asked, I couldn't give you more than a sentence on what he does. He got his PhD >15 years ago, and from several IQ tests I did in my younger years scored around the mid 130s. We talk and think very much alike. But because of my poor recall, I think people who don't know me won't understand what I'm trying to say (or give me a chance).

I'm concerned that my credibility will look weak. I look around and its like people have an incredible script, going on sometimes for hours on a topic. My entire life revolves around design, almost all my thinking and 'spare' times goes to it, but I can't talk about it.

A big week-long design convention is coming up one week from now, and there are a few people I would really like to work with/for and I'm concerned I'll look like an idiot when talking to them despite my capabilities (I can hardly flap my work in their face, so talking about it is usually how people ""network"" - another mysterious social dance I don't know the steps to).

"Feeling Life is Pointless because of AI Idk if this belongs here but I have to vent.

I’ve never been able to communicate or understand people due to my Aspergers/ASD, but I’ve always felt that at least the arts can allow me to understand others at least in some way.

But now the rise of AI in creative fields makes me want to give up. For all the supposed benefits it has for ‘streamlining’ and ‘democratizing’ art, all it seems to me to be doing is ridding art of that pesky human element. Especially in our current, worthless capitalist hellhole of a world, where everything looses its human value to the whims of economic inputs and outputs, I have no doubt that very soon the majority of commercially available art will be dominated by non-human entities. And soon we’ll reach a point when, even if an individual person creates a beautiful piece or invents a new style, that style will simply be replicated almost instantaneously and dilute whatever feelings one my have for the thing beyond a algorithmic dopamine tick.

The world (or at least the United States) is already so difficult to survive in economically that pursuing art is already a stupid risk few can entertain, let alone actually pursue. Now there’s even less chance a person can survive making art because a machine will produce infinitely more ‘content’ (a word I despise with every fiber of my fucking being) in any style imaginable. I don’t even doubt that, in a generation or two, art as a thing humans pursue for pleasure will be seen as old fashioned, at least in traditional/non-digital forms; the idea that people will continue using traditional ways feels naïve to me, considering humans almost always default to the path of least resistance. Painting, for example, will be a thing a person considers doing for 5 minutes. They’ll download an app, generate something that’d make Van Gogh jealous, and then get bored. 

And now I feel so lost and alone. It feels like my one real window into people’s souls has been stolen from me. Art is communicative and interpersonal, or at least it was until now. Now I’ll always look art with a little suspicion. Whatever emotional or intellectual connection I may make form with the artist will never feel as strong now. I hate this.

I don’t care if it sounds hyperbolic. Life feels truly worthless to me now. What even is the goddamn point.",1

The problem is that this affects socializing, because people see this girl with headphones on and think it’s impolite or that I’m listening to music while talking, but I’m not.

I am struggling with my unique interest. Can anyone relate or offer me advice. So I have a rly hard w my unique interest. They change so much and so often.

Does anyone have any experience with this and does anyone have any advice as to what I should do. I really wish I could be one of those aspies that just super interested in one thing and that was it. I feel like things would be simpler for me. I just want to know how I can over come this because it’s honestly very debilitating.,1

"A couple executive functioning questions to help my husband… Hi! My husband has Aspergers. He is an amazing person! His mood (also has bipolar) and ability to handle life is heavily affected by how much sleep he gets. He really struggles to take his meds and go to bed at a healthy, consistent time. He is normally twitch streaming but can definitely (and I think this is what he means to do) just do it/play computer game for an hour rather than two or more. Sometimes, he’s stopped and is doing other things. He has an alarm that goes off but will often turn it off without getting up to take his meds.
He also doesn’t take care of other things in a timely manner which often ends up causing us problems (like bills) or he’ll then feel like he has to do them (like dishes) before bed which puts him to bed too late even though he could have done it earlier.
Any tips? Thanks 🙏

Date ordered: November 3, 2022

Date completed: February 2, 2023

On February 2, 2023, the Registrant appeared before a panel of the Inquiries, Complaints and Reports Committee (the Panel) to be cautioned with respect to their compliance with the Standards of Practice for Dual Registration, Consent, Record Keeping, Advertising, and Communicating a Diagnosis.

The Panel reminded the Registrant that it is their responsibility to ensure that the patient understands the professional status of the service provider and clarifies the professional capacity they are acting in when providing services. The Panel informed the Registrant that they are required to clearly distinguish and identify their professional status in their patient records, in addition to documenting that a consent discussion took place.

The Panel reiterated to the Registrant that the College’s Standard of Practice for Communicating a Diagnosis requires that a registrant performs the act within the context of a naturopath–patient relationship and that they review the diagnosis with the patient.

The Panel expressed its concern with the Registrant’s online presence, specifically noting that it may have lacked transparency and have been confusing to some members of the public who are not familiar with professional designations and qualifications. The Panel impressed upon the Registrant that all advertising is to be comprehensible to its intended audience.",1

"Culture shock and autism What are your experiences of living abroad or traveling and going through the frustration stage of culture shock? I don't only mean in cultures that are very different to your own (as culture shock can happen in another culture and be more subtle.)

I find that after the honeymoon phase of culture shock, I get pretty annoyed and frustrated by little differences and I stay annoyed- rather, the things I love about the culture that are different and the things that are annoying exist at the same time, in every moment. But, if I focus on my annoyance, it doesn't help. Also, people from that culture don't notice the thing, can't empathise, or get defensive, of course :)

"Feel like giving up work - please help 
I have a fairly successful career and objectively am doing well, but it is not without its struggles. I have listed these below for ease, and if any readers relate or can offer guidance on how to overcome it would be much appreciated: 

1. I find myself consistently in situations that are out of my comfort zone such as public speaking, which I have to prepare for and know every single detail about on the subject matter beforehand in order to confidently be able to deliver. This, combined with the act of doing it, is exhausting both mentally and physically. I’m not typically somebody who rocks as a stim but I found myself recently doing this before a public speaking event. I suspect the more experienced I become the less taxing this would be. My main reason for the anxiety is not knowing how to phrase a sentence or position a message which I think is due to autism. 
2. Relationship issues: I haven’t had major issues with this is the past but over the last 12 months have been managed by someone who evidently does’t like me and misunderstands me/my character. I don’t know whether they feel threatened by my (perceived) confidence or actually think I’m rubbish. Some further context, my boss’ boss thinks highly of me and values my difference in thinking and boss knows that. I know I’m good at my job but not being able to get answers to questions in a timely manner from boss really affects how effective I can be. This has knocked my confidence as I have also gone a long period without any positive reinforcement. I tried to give feedback in a constructive way and it went really badly. 
Considering a study found that having a bad manager is on par with having a bad marriage, even for NTs, this experience has been really difficult to handle. That being said, I’ve caused minimal collateral damage from the internal rage considering how bad I feel; except 
3. Said boss has done as much as possible to tarnish my name through either direct comments or the use of semantics, which can be very impactful (probably more so than comments imo).  Some colleagues probably already think I’m a bit odd as I don’t follow the crowd and occasionally offer a differing viewpoint to the status quo. I check myself when doing so however due to my cognitive differences, I still don’t always get it right. 

I have requested a new boss under the veil of a different project I’ll be working on, without fully stating my reasons for the request. I have allude to some of the issues I’ve been having but a watered down, palatable version cognisant of my stronger ND emotions. 

The issues I’m facing have made me feel burned out and impacted my self-esteem, and I’m reassessing whether I’m cut out for the life of leadership, even though others have seen this potential in me. If anyone can relate or able to advise how they overcame similar situations it would be much appreciated 🫶🏻

Posting in here as I know my fellow NDs will understand and be able to advise according to our neurology and cognitive differences. I have NTs that would try to help but I don’t think their advice would help in this situation.",1

Has a parent, relative or peer ever made you feel inadequate or undesirable due to a lack of professional or academic achievement on your part?

Those with ASD, well everything is harder: academics, social skills and career skills. Nobody wants the deck stacked against them but sadly this is the case for many with ASD.

Have you ever been made to feel dirty/unimportant based on your lack of acheivment and ability? The sort of situation where a parent/ peer doesn’t hate what you do, more just sort of hates the totality of you? Do you think it’s right to have love/ acceptance conditioned on talent and success?

"From a comfortable introvert to the extroverted and socially anxious aspies out there. Just want to send you some love.

If I have any skills or attributes, navigating social mazes and solving social riddles are not amongst them. Fluid communication is neither predictable nor intuitive. Naturally, this has placed tremendous restrictions on my ability to develop and maintain friendships, as well as attaining social cachet. 

However, as socialising and status are not a priorities of mine, the above is not an issue for me. I am perfectly content in my own company, I very seldom, if ever, feel lonely, and I am completely at ease talking to strangers and acquaintances as and when it is necessary. My neurological wiring and their effects on my social ability is not something which causes anxiety. 

I am incredibly lucky that I am a comfortable introvert. I am also incredibly lucky that I am unaffected by engaging with others when necessary while also having the confidence to disengage at my own whims without any sense of guilt or shame. 

I cannot even imagine how difficult I would find life if I longed for what would be considerable endeavour, let alone being of a nervous disposition in the first place. 

My motivation for this post is unclear to myself really. While I can definitely emphasise with finding social interaction to be an irrational and frustrating conundrum, I cannot pretend that I am all too troubled by same. Beyond a throwaway comment along the lines of *""have you looked into Stoicism/Buddhism/Absurdism?""* I am not especially inclined or qualified to give any meaningful advise either.

If every aspie went on strike and chose to only share his or her inventions and discoveries among a community of other neurodivergents, the world would eventually eat its own.

"When is it considered meddling? Hoping to get some insight. 

A little about me. I have a BA in psychology, focused in child and social psychology. I did an internship with children on the spectrum way back in the day. and my nephew is autistic. 

I just started leading a girl scout troop and one of my girls is clearly on the spectrum. Her parents had her join the troop in effort to help her make friends since she doesn’t really have any. At the same time I don’t think they have any clue that she is on the spectrum. 

Do I mention it? Or just give her the space she needs to participate to the fullest of her ability? She is no trouble at all for the troop, and I am perfectly capable of integrating her.

"Is there any out for a short asian guy with asperger? 


Hi. I'm a 5'7 21M asian dude who has been clinically diagnosed as having asperger syndrome. It's not like I'm totally autistic. I'm high functional, but my social ability is still bad enough that I have with some social interactions and maintaining friendships (basically, in every school or classroom, they'll be *that guy.* I'm *that guy*). You can forget my women skills because I am way below the level of even considering that stage. I found that others think I'm a very boring person, that I always seem so dull and uninterested all the time even though I never felt that way.

When I was younger, I was quite tall since I have an early growth spurt. Although I was socially awkward, some girls find me 'cute' and acted so, so I may attribute that to my height at that time. Since then, I've rarely grown and all my friends ended up being all taller than me. 

In getting attention from girls, because I'm socially awkward, I felt that at least if I was tall I at least could use that factor to compensate. Now that I'm short, I found most short men compensate by being social and charismatic, but that is not possible for me, or at least insanely difficult because I never managed to make a full breakthrough before. Yes, there was a period when I lost a decent chunk of weight and became more confident and made more friends, but that friendship never lasts for some reason and in the end, I ended up becoming invisible again anyway.",1

I've moved to a less crowded space in the building, disabled all the lights, and acquired noise-canceling headphones. Managed to get around IT blocking extra software so I found means to pass the time. People don't try and small talk with me as much in comparison to a year ago.

Yet it's the second week of that and I feel like my soul is being drained. I feel like an animal in an open field during the hunting season. The headphones and music are sometimes not enough and I don't want to crank the volume not to hurt my ears. The other light sources and motions in the corners of my sight. I have means of passing the time but I'd get in trouble if someone found out.

No changing jobs for me any time soon either sadly. It's hard to find a good job for visually impaired people and I do like what I am doing - I just hate the baggage that comes with working on-site. 

Do you peeps maybe have any tips on how to deal with this? Make the office days more bearable?",1
"I had to explain to someone why people with Asperger’s dislike pointless small talk (in my experience anyway) I dislike small talk, due to it feeling unnecessary, I don’t need to be talking constantly over things that aren’t productive all the time, and it seems like if I don’t I’m “anti social” or whatever people say behind me at school

So I described it like this.

Picture you went to a town, not for a particular reason, but you did, and everyone there rapidly pats their heads as they walk, this doesn’t serve any purpose, but people do it, and you are outcasted if you don’t

You don’t see the point of this, and it just gets aggravating that you have to keep patting your head for no actual purpose. But to blend in you have to do it. Otherwise you’re alienated.

Hope this made some sense",1
"Does anyone else hate conflict even when it comes to stuff in shows, movies, etc? I don't know if this is necessarily an autism thing, but I'm posting it here because I do feel like for me part of it comes from a sensitive nervous system (from autism) so thought others might relate

A lot of the time I feel uncomfortable and stressed just from conflict or things turning bad even in shows and movies. Or even just when things get more complicated in shows.

Like for example, with Breaking Bad... Obviously the first season isn't sunshine and rainbows, and there are plenty of problems. But it's like as the seasons go on and things get more and more tangled, and the show introduces more conflicts than just the main one, it stresses some part of my brain out. Chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer, cooking meth in an RV (plus the couple of deaths in season 1)? Yeah, not exactly a positive show, but, ya know. It still has less of a negative vibe than the later seasons, there's humor sometimes. Then as the seasons go on and more people start dying, there starts being more conflict in Walt's family, the whole thing with Tuco and then Gus where Walt and Jesse's lives are in danger a lot of the time... The show's still great, don't get me wrong, but it stresses me out in a way.

 My brain's blanking on other specific examples, but it's always been like this for me with shows. You know when a show goes half a season, a season or 2 of being calmer or at least kind of just a consistent basic storyline, and then they've got to introduce conflict and things to switch it up? Like shows where people start dying, things like that. I get that it would be boring if there was no conflict and nothing changed obviously, but it's like it sets off the overly sensitive part of my brain and makes me want things to just stay calmer and more consistent. It's also why a lot of the time I just avoid action-y shows or movies, even if they sound interesting.

"My husband feels alone being married to me My husband of six years randomly turned to me and said it's lonely being married to an autistic person. He was sad because his family lives far away and he was missing them. I didn't know he wanted comfort. Whenever I feel bad I want people to leave me alone so I do the same for people. It turns out to be the wrong thing a lot. My ex boyfriend called me cold and my friends called me distant. This is mostly because I don't show emotions much and I don't hug. I might be asexual, I don't like physical touch from people I'm not intimate with, and am not good at knowing what to say to make people feel better, especially if I have to lie to do it. I calmly suggested that maybe my husband needs someone who's not autistic but that makes him even sadder. How do I, at 30, learn to be supportive? Everyone in my family is stoic and we were punished for not being that way. I feel like I have to lie and be disingenuous to seem caring...",1
"How do I tell if my friends are ignoring me? Possibly trying to phase me out? I have gone through this so many times before you would think I would have it down, but I don’t. I have come to the realization that my friends, my 2 closest friends, don’t respond a lot of the time when I text them. A lot of the times my messages where I send memes or talk about my special interests or anything like that go ignored. It didn’t used to be like this. We used to all talk. I have known one of these friends since high school. None of us are married and we all planned on moving in together but now I just don’t know. My mind keeps telling me that they are annoying by me every time I text them as most of the time they don’t respond. At first I thought it was them just needing time to respond but like, this would also be on days I knew they were off and we were conversations just fine. I would somehow just kill the conversation and they wouldn’t reply to me anymore. They know I’m on the spectrum and any awkwardness isn’t intentional but like, I have been abandoned and left alone so many times that I begin to shift toward those thoughts pretty easy. I then tried to change the way I would text as I was told some people don’t feel the need to respond if it isn’t in the form of a question. So I did that. Started framing my texts as a question. Like I still info dump every now and again when I get excited but like, when it’s met with nothing it really fucking hurts. They know I have been dealing with being ignored and feeling extremely lonely but this happens anyway. I barely get invited anywhere anymore too. Most of the time I am the one making plans and now I feel like they are just tolerating me. I just don’t know how to tell if they are ignoring me on purpose or not.",1

"Anyone here lose skills due to ""burnout""? I am really struggling to find my way back to how I was. I had a stressful living situation with neighbors and I moved, but I think the moving process is what killed me. Any time my crazy neighbors went away like on vacation, I felt like myself again, and I assumed when I moved into a new home I'd just go right back to how I always was but that's not the case.

The buying process, moving process, and dealing with settling in and fixing up a new house seems to have destroyed me, even though I've done it before. Things are ""back to normal"" as in nothing stressful at my house, but I find myself wasting my days. I don't do anything I used to do. I never went back to how I was before I had crazy neighbors.

Although just an example of a little thing, I used to do my nails on a certain day of the week which should be an easy thing (a huge sensory issue for me is my nails growing, I trim and paint them once a week- or I used to. Now I let it go for weeks... it's awful.) and general keeping up of things is very difficult. I do laundry ok, I shower every day, but it's like beyond that I don't have the willpower. I just focus on my job which I do at home, but even so some times I'm slacking lately. But only because I'm trying to figure myself out. I used to be so much more on top of everything and felt like my life was in order. This doesn't include my creative endeavors which was basically my identity. Also not running errands like I used to, waiting until the last minute or not doing things at all.

Can anyone relate to this? Did your life change drastically and you were never the same? I used to clean my car once a week too, I stopped. Its an absolute mess now. I stopped doing so many things.

But what's funny is I \*used\* to be the way I've become now. Over the years, especially when I lived alone for a period of time, I gained skills and habits. Mostly out of my own loneliness. But I kept them up once I got into a relationship again. I had my habits. Prior to that, a prior relationship with a toxic person who expected me to be someone else I did learn a lot of skills. Also from college. And it helped me function even if part of it wasn't due to the right reasons, and they're all gone now.

I feel like a shell of who I was. Right now I'm trying to work on my creative endeavors for 1 hour a day, which I didn't do at all yesterday. And trying to do my nails once a week on the day of the week I always used to do them except I think I'm going to miss it at this rate. I mention the nails thing again because that was just so simple and I feel it still is, or should be, but it isn't anymore.

I am worried I will never go back to how I used to be. I just used to be more on top of everything. I used to make art and submit it places like to local shows. I can't even imagine my brain being able to deal with that. Did I really die? Will I ever be the way I was? I want to know if anyone else lost everything in ""burnout"". It feels like that's not even the right word but it is. I am a shell of who I was, I basically live and do nothing. ",1
"today was not my day hey! good night. i'm a 19 year old boy (ftm), diagnosed at 11 but found out at 17. after that moment in my life, everything started to feel better, because i was learning about myself and understanding why i am like this. of course it wasn't easy, but at least i accepted who i am and stopped feeling guilty about things that weren't my fault (like my personality).

but now i'm looking for some advice (and i need to vent, too). because throughout my life, beyond the social difficulties, my biggest drawback and limitation has been anxiety. anxiety has been with me since childhood, causing me physical and emotional discomfort, one that prevents me from eating and, in turn, causes me to vomit numerous times (even if i have nothing in my stomach); and it's a vicious circle, because my anxiety inhibits me from eating, but at the same time i stop eating because I fear vomiting in public. and this last thing happened every time i had a class presentation, or a new school year started, or i had different experiences, but as the years progressed and when i entered the university, it became more of a habit when i had to go to study, since every time, i stopped eating from the day before due to my uncertainty. it was difficult for me to sleep and when i woke up, i spent my first or last minutes before leaving the house vomiting, which not only hurt me physically, but also emotionally, so when i was in college, it was like being there with just my body and not with my mind.

it's difficult, because every time it happens, i can only think: ""it happened again""; and again, and again, and i just get frustrated and ashamed, not understanding why even if i try breathing exercises, anxiety relief techniques, thinking different thoughts, the result is always the same. it hurts to live like this.

the intensity of my anxiety increased in the past year. i lost weight, i isolated myself, i was with people who were not very good for me and that led my parents to recognize the magnitude of the situation. so today i went to see a psychologist, who treated me during childhood. however, at the end of the hour and after telling him how i felt (exactly what i wrote before and a couple of other things), it seemed to me that i remained in the same place and i did not receive any answer to my doubts, plus the worst thing was the fact that, after hearing psychologist's opinions about the lgbt community, non-binary people, and that biologically men were more likely to be unfaithful because they could have sex with women without loving them (which i genuinely disagree with, because in my opinion it's more a matter of values and respect, and is not related to biological factors or should be justified with them).

obviously i was upset and that caused me to be irritated and argue with him, although it was not the reason for the consultation and i know that i should not judge him by his opinions but by his work performance. ...although being part of the lgbt (and trans) community, i couldn't not take it personally.

and at the end there was another moment of tension after asking him if he thought I needed medication, where he told me in a stronger tone that psychotherapy was not an obligation and the decision to do it was mine. that if i did not have the disposition, he could only refer me to a neurologist. that there were no good or bad decisions, and something like that in five years or more, i would see the results of it. i don't quite understand what he meant at the end, or if it had to do with the fact that i could regret it. it was weird.

and i know perfectly well that i let my ideals interfere, but i don't know how to feel comfortable when i don't trust or tolerate the person who can help me. maybe it's several things and it's just that i also felt disappointed, sort of sad, to think that he didn't take seriously how i felt about my anxiety. you know, like someone is always worse off and mine isn't that serious, even though it's not a competition when someone feels bad.

even so, the psychologist assigned me an appointment for the next week, but i really don't want to go and force myself to be with him, especially when consultations are expensive in my country (i live in venezuela) and getting money is difficult for my parents. i would prefer to go to a neurologist, start a treatment (which is not cheap either) and try to move forward... but i would like to know the opinion of someone else. i feel very overwhelmed with what happened today.",1
"Too NT to get along with other ND’s. Too ND to get along with other NT’s. Anyone else feel like this? Like your just balancing in the middle of being neurotypical and being neurodivergent?

She has autism and she’s friendly and all that but we just don’t click? It’s the same with other autistic people I’ve been forced to talk to. I just feel I’m too “normal” to talk to them.

But then with neurotypical people, I just can’t talk to them. I’ve tried but they just look at me with pity in their eyes, like “oh this poor person, I’ll just talk to them to make them feel less bad about having to deal with their own stupidity for the rest of their life.” Or they flat out make fun of me.

Why is talking on the phone so stressful? What are some tips for not being anxious of talking on the phone for people with an autism neurotype? ,1
"How different would someone be if they weren't autistic/neurodivergent? I know getting caught up wondering what if isn't healthy, but at the same time I can't help but be curious. Especially with my recent ADHD(moderate Combined-type)diagnosis which further explains things than simply being autistic(procrastination, distractibility, internal restlessness, etc). My school years were basically defined by a lack of social/academic success especially in my adolescence. I am nearly 23 and still don't have a degree, and am basically starting over from scratch anyway. My goal is to be a police officer, but with scattered work history and lots of withdrawn classes it will be a couple of years before I try and apply. I am still working on expanding my interests to include more mainstream things(music, shows,etc) though I am a nerd at heart. 

That being said, this is something I came across in a different post:

>Being autistic doesn't fundamentally change a person (let me explain). Mean NT's would be mean autistic people, nice NT's will be nice autistic people. Autism is more of an intensifier of existing traits with a grab bag of fun disabling features thrown in (hand flapping, social dysfunction, self harm, stimming, ect). 

I plan on asking my psychiatrist more about this later in the month during my medication follow up, but this doesn't seem inaccurate. Like despite my social ineptitude leading to some cringey moments of inappropriate(albeit unintentional behavior), I have been told I am a kind person at heart(family, teachers, acquaintances) and described as mild mannered as well. Plus nowadays lots of ''normies'' are into nerdy aspects of pop culture to a degree. Including superhero films/shows, nostalgia based cartoon shows, and as a black guy who is atypical compared to stereotypes, plenty of other black guys dig anime. Michael B Jordan is an open otaku for example.

All this to say is while I wish I was farther along in terms of life goals and a better childhood(dysfunctional family aside) I don't dislike my basic personality, nor do I think it would be radically different. I don't mind being a tall black guy who isn't into basketball or isn't into vulgar rap. Not that I don't have personal flows, but I most likely wouldn't magically be an asshole without my conditions. My interests would be the same most likely, and I would actually be better at them without the executive function/hyperfixation causing me to stumble and kicking the can down the road so to speak(style hopping in martial arts,etc). Plus less of an obstacle for my career of choice as well. Without ADHD, I could definitely focus on things better, being cleaner and not having clutter all over my room among other things.

I know people often say that without autism they wouldn't be the same person, but even if that were true for me that is kinda the whole point. Basic parts about me would be the same but with little to none of the hinderance I have dealt with all my life. Maybe just having either ASD *or* ADHD would have made things easier instead of having both, but I could do without either of them.

"Gonna get tested for aspergers - what should I expect and prepare for? Hello, I'm a teenager, and my mother, apparently, has suspected that I have aspergers since I was a young child. This is news to me. It only came up because I got overwhelmed during a music show (the music was unbelievably loud), cried, shook, begged my mother to let me go away, and finally ran off, shrieked into a pillow, and recited a prayer a dozen times. Apparently that's not normal behavior, lol.

Now she's getting me tested for aspergers - she claims that I need help to solve my social issues, which, admittedly, are hurting my life quite a bit, though I'm not sure how much of it is due to me being socially-obvlivious and how much of it is just me not caring and generally having a very stubborn, individualistic personality. You don't know what you don't know, I guess - it sometimes takes me years to look back on things I say and realize how socially-oblivious I was.

Anyway, that's probably enough context. My mother has told me to write a list of all of my social struggles to relate to whatever doctor I'll be seeing. I was just curious if anyone who's been through the testing process can tell me what to expect, how to prepare, etc. Thanks.",1
"Male aspies suddenly looking older and losing part of your identity? 42M here  One of the common tropes for us is looking far younger than our ages. 

And I did for YEARS. Until 36 or 37 I still looked boyish. People routinely would say  ""Damn bro, I thought you were like 23!"" 

Not just older folks, but I'm talking even very young adults at work born in 1998 or something too!

Not only did it feel awesome, but it was a security blanket as a late bloomer. If I was a little awkward or didn't grasp something or hadn't reached certain life milestones, it felt forgiven or overlooked easier. Quirky qualities just go hand in hand with appearing young.

Now though?

Most people aren't surprised by my age anymore, which hurts bad. I'm always talking about the 80s (and 90s) pop culture and they don't push back or think I wasn't around then.

 I feel like a stranger in my own body no longer receiving the positive attention I once did when I looked like an androgynous '00s emo type. Losing my looks forces me to navigate a world I'm still not that familiar with or ready for. I don't have the life experience to back up how old I started looking with nasolabial folds and deep forehead lines.

Granted this is a technicality, but I'm also salty about being the tail end of Gen X (1981) and lumped more with people older than me than with people younger. Makes growing/looking older even scarier.

That means on paper, I supposedly am the same as people born in 1962-65 (who could have been teen parents to me) while different from people born in 1982-85 (Old Millennials that I grew up with).

For context, I'm to the left of Bernie and I don't like hierarchy, so I guess looking more like a traditional cisgender middle aged white dude makes me feel like an oppressor, when I'm just a big hippie stoner in reality.

I can get easily offended by stuff that doesn't even have anything to do with me, and I don't know whether it's just narcissism, or if it's a glitch in my hyper-empathy, or something else.

I think a lot of it has to do with wording. Like, if I stumble on a YouTube video, or see a PSA on TV, and they're like, ""You need to change this aspect of your life in order to achieve this goal,"" my initial reaction is ""Screw you, I'm not changing. I don't even WANT that result!"" Even though, clearly, I'm just not the audience for the message.

If the wording is different though, my reaction will be different. If it's worded more like, ""If you're struggling to meet this goal, here's what you can change,"" then my reaction is more like ""Oh cool, this is probably helpful to whoever needs it.""

Typing this all out is making me wonder whether it's actually a problem with me, or just a problem with whoever is writing these things. If your goal is to help people, you really need to choose your wording carefully.

"I’m a teacher who unfortunately misses some important stuff Hey everyone, so I’m not going to sugar coat it, I got in some trouble today, and I ended up self reporting. So, for background knowledge, I am a student teacher and I’m a little more than halfway through the program. Me, the CT and my supervisor agree that it’s going very well, except in 1 aspect. Unfortunately, it’s the aspect that is the most important. Student safety. As I was finishing up my lesson right before lunch, I was telling students to pick up trash from the floor, and they weren’t listening so I decided to pick up trash myself. In the 10 seconds that I bent down to pick everything up, a student left the classroom without me realizing it, and some students began horse-playing and when I had the situation explained to me, I realized that someone could have gotten seriously hurt. My CT explained that I could get in a lot of trouble for that, which I was aware of. If this sounds bad, it’s because it is. As you know, I am on the Autism Spectrum, so when things are structured and have a schedule than I excel at the job. However, transition time is really rough, because it’s completely unstructured, and so many things happen that my brain can’t handle everything. So, I can see 100 percent of the things that are happening (if my eyes are on the students), but I can only process about half of it, and that causes me to miss some potentially dangerous situations. I told my supervisor about this and she wanted to try to have the CT in the room during transitioning to keep an extra pair of eyes on the students. No transition has ever gone bad when we are both in the room. I have faith that this is going to work and that I’ll be able to pass. However, what do you think I should do when I’m all on my own?

"Does anyone feel like they have to put up a front to fit in with society? I've masked most of my life, albeit probably not that well as a kid, but as I grew up I've learned to adapt and so I've relied on medication to help me mask my neurodivergent tendencies. I remember I used to be very outward about my special interests with everyone, though I've eased up on sharing them if someone doesn't seem interested. 

It kinda hurts that I can't share my interests without being heavily judged, but I guess that's just how it is. At least I know there's some interests I can share but my more childish ones aren't exactly something I'm willing to share with others unless it naturally comes up in conversation, which even then I gotta limit talking about it.

The reason why I bring this up is because I put on this professional, contributing member of society front which I guess is a good thing, but it's just exhausting to ""adult"" if you know what I mean. Sometimes I just wanna let loose and act like a kid and just drop my adult responsibilities.",1
"So I found out I'm all types of screwed up thanks due to my autism/asperges So it turns out thanks due to my high functioning autism and aspergers (before it was mixed I was legit label as both). I'm all screwed up. Now to top off things I have

1. Complex PTSD
2. Autism Burnout
3. Depression
4. Several types of anxiety problems like GAD
5. AND MORE

&#x200B;

The sad thing is all of this can be linked to real world stuff. Like our hard time in workplaces which makes poverty or homeless a real likely for some of us that can't hold down a job due to no fault of our own. How general society treats us. How given countries many of us live in offers 0 help and sometimes even stands in our way. And for us to move to a country with a good or better system, it is impossible due to lack of money and what not.

So to ""fix"" it I have to do one of the following.

* Find a way to change an unchangeable thing like the gov.
* Be drugged up. Like legal or illegal. Most directly can effect how you think and will take what little control of my life away (note the next point)
* Find a way to be OK/happy with things while at the same time we are looked down on society. For example, I can't hold down a good job due to being disabled and having a number of problems. But society talks down to many of us for not holding down a job. But, when we do work we can only work part time min wage, and then society talks down to us because we aren't working full time at a good job. But we can't get in a good job or hold it down. And it gets worse when people find out I have multiple STEM degrees. So I have to find a way to basically being slave labor for some support network so I don't become homeless, that at any point I can become homeless even if it is to include the support network gets tired of me, and I will realistically never have a family of my own or be able to afford one. 10x worse since I'm in my mid 30s.
* Death (which everyone knows... it's looked down on by society to the point church nuts will lie to you, spend 0 time getting to know you, and act like they care or someone cares about you or like this isn't an actual option. But being honest this is an option and I can't have these problems if that option is taken logically speaking. And there is a reason why we have a FAR higher likely. Even more if you're high functioning. IMO it's directly linked to society treats high functioning as if we are normal and almost never get support, vs the expectations of low functioning and there is no societal push for more.)",1
"Does anybody here think being autistic is kind of hilarious? I know this will sound crazy to some, but I've always masked really hard and tried to fit in. I'm giving up because the world is in chaos and most people are messy anyway. The average person is so egotistical and arrogant that they live their life needing to feel superior to everyone around them. Many of them look down on homeless people, people from different income brackets, different races, addicts, different nationalities, ages, etc... all while being painfully average and proving the Dunning-Kruger theory correct. I'd rather be a good person compared to the way many NT people view the world. I feel like unmasking gives the message I live by anyway - that none of this is that important and people should just try to be good people & not hurt others. I wouldn't be hurting anybody by being weird asf, but it *will* make any other ""weird"" people feel better about being themselves. So who cares? Being autistic is like being an internet troll in real life, imo. It's like, if I'm already not fitting in easily, and you're going to dislike me because of my mannerisms and differences, then let me unabashedly be myself to the irritation of those I wouldn't want to know anyway? If someone dislikes me for being socially different, then they're not for me. We'll all die one day, and the Autistic life expectancy is low anyway so what are we doing trying so hard to make everyone around us happy at our own expense? Or maybe it's just me.",1

"Communicating Sigh. I went downstairs to get a drink. My wife was sitting on the couch, with her tv show on. I don’t care and didn’t think anything of it. I went into the garage to refill the drinks and had to step over a mess she made yesterday (and she admits).

She told me, after getting worked up about potential work travel in a few years if I get promoted (yes…), that she was only sitting down for three minutes and would clean the garage now.

I said “Okay”

She proceeded to yell at me about the tone and meaning of those four letters. I explained that I’m sure she was doing something else and I don’t want her to feel I’m redirecting her to a different task. She tells me that it was horrible the way I said okay (and allegedly I had facial expressions) and that she’s tired of telling me when I say something not nice and I say it means something different. Said it is my “responsibility to fix this.”

I’m like 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️

I feel she’s hyper attuned to anything negative. And she didn’t appreciate when I said we’re talking about Potential work travel in like 5 or 6 years. I feel like it’s mountain out of mole hill here. 

But I’m sharing this on this sub because she’s telling me, to me, that she’s not going to give any wiggle room to me on communication, knowing it’s hard for me to make the proper facial expressions and sound and connect with words and terms and watching out for no pauses. We’ve been together 15 years and I feel I give her so much slack (like how I didn’t care she made that big mess yesterday; I certainly never said a word about it), and I’m scrutinized and crucified for everything.

I feel like it’s better to just not share. Not talk. Not be present. I don’t feel safe being vulnerable and unmasked. And I need to unmask to keep my sanity.

I dunno. Not looking for any responses. Just venting.",1
"Anyone here have experience with resolving trauma symptoms that amplify ASD? Wondering if I should switch therapists (autism/trauma) Originally posted in r/askatherapist but figured I would post here too.

**Background**: I'm 25M and had (IMO) a pretty rough early life. I had no friends for most of my childhood, and when I finally did start making friends it was because of a false persona I had created, so I didn't really feel connected to them. My parents also fought a lot and my father was abusive to me occasionally (he drank and smoked pot almost constantly, but I didn't know it until I was older), but died when I was 10. I also have an abusive sister who lived with me when I was a teenager, among some SA incidents, seeing violence growing up, and many other things. As a result, relationships are extremely triggering for me and interacting with people at all is draining and difficult. I have so much anxiety about saying the wrong thing, in addition to deep shame about myself, that I heavily mask my personality by telling lies and remaining quiet. My first relationship was when I was 25 and my first friendship besides my best friend was when I was 24, so I am behind in this way.

I also have an autism diagnosis, which I mask as well. However, I truly believe (and my current therapist believes similarly) that my autism is very mild and does not explain the relational difficulties I have. For a long time, I acted as if I didn't want friendships or relationships, while feeling lonely deep down (which IMO is more trauma based than biological). My therapist is not well-informed at treating trauma, but I have done some ""trauma recovery"" on my own and feel way better about myself and some areas of my life are much better. Namely, I've stopped taking things personally so often and my ""recovery time"" from getting offended is much faster. However, I still have a lot to work on.

**Therapy so far**: Saw a psychodynamic therapist for a year in 2018 for depression that I no longer have, then an autism specialist who used a CBT-like approach from 2019 to present.

I have started reading Pete Walker's work regarding C-PTSD and my therapist and I both believe that this could be affecting me. Pete mentions that the Freeze response is often characterized by ""escape"" strategies like maladaptive daydreaming, ""zoning out,"" and use of sedative drugs (pot, alcohol) and compulsive overeating, which are all things I struggle with. I won't claim to have C-PTSD as I'm not diagnosed, but my therapist and I both think attempting a similar type of recovery process could serve me well.

**My question**: Like I mentioned, my current therapist does not know much about trauma healing and thus most of our recent therapy sessions has been me reporting to her what I have researched and getting her opinion. She has said that she will start doing some of her own research too. I am starting to think that it may be better for me to switch to someone who knows more about trauma, but it's likely that that person wouldn't know much about autism, so... I don't know. Plus, what therapy modality would I even look for? The stuff Pete Walker does seems like a niche type of psychodynamic therapy, and then I might do it and find out that all of this ended up being biological anyway. What would you recommend?

**tl;dr: I have autism and a trauma history and see an autism specialist who doesn't do much trauma work. I am thinking about switching to someone who specializes in trauma, but am worried about the risks. What do you think?**",1

"absolutely hate that I can't even do my relatively undemanding job This is a vent more than anything else.

There are just so many ordinary, basic things that happen frequently at work that I find enormously stressful, for example if I get unclear instructions (and for psychological reasons I don't really understand I always seem incapable of just asking for clarification), or if I have to give an estimated completion date for a project when I'm not really sure how long it's going to take, or when someone expects me to know about something I haven't been told about, or when I'm given multiple tasks at once, etc. At least some of these things generally happen multiple times a day and often bring me to the verge of an outright meltdown.

But these are just normal, basic, fundamental things, that I'd encounter basically whatever job I did, and it's not reasonable to expect other people to change their behaviour to the extent that they would have to to avoid things like this. Everyone else around me seems to be so capable and even handle just normal things and I hate that about myself",1

"What next? Recently diagnosed in UK… I’ve recently been diagnosed by Psychiatry UK through NHS Right to Choose. The report is being written to my GP.

"Spatial ability may be a strength of people with Autism There is evidence that people with Autism, on average, outperform neurotypicals when it comes to spatial ability. Frith (1993) and Baron-Cohen (1997) have discussed the advantage Autistic people display in the block design and embedded figures tests. This relates to the solitary foraging hypothesis (Reser, 2011), which states that autistic traits are associated with ""ecological competence"" (AKA superior hunting and foraging). 

Kell and Lubinski (2013) found that spatial ability is neglected in educational settings. Mathematics and linguistics are a large focus and as a result many talented individuals do not reach their potential. Even standard spatial tests, such as block design, only feature 2D models. I believe that spatial tests can be improved and spatial skills facilitated for, enhancing the schooling experience of many people with Autism.

I have designed a spatial test with this purpose in mind. If you are interested in discovering your own spatial ability, do give it a go. It is completely picture based, and you may find it enjoyable. Use the code CASA20OFF to take it for free. Link --> [https://www.npiqtest.com/casa](https://www.npiqtest.com/casa)",1

"When someone speaks to me, and I hear/understand each word individually, but I don't know what they're telling me... At work, in conversation I'm having where someone is speaking directly to me (all this happens over Slack calls) it's like their words become blurry. I hear everything they're saying word-for-word, but sometimes the words are not creating a full enough picture for me.

There's a full sentence coming my way...and I hear it all. But I'm not understanding.

This happens particularly when I'm new to talking to someone in particular.

But not all the time. A lot of the time I'm fully hearing everything.

I'm not sure what's triggering it yet. All I know is that my brain did not process that information in real time and I'll get to ask them to say what they just said in another way.

Actually I JUST realized it happens mainly when someone is speaking TO ME, or at least when I'm highly involved in what they're sharing (such as when they're speaking to the team I'm in.)

I went to the park and something made me message a coworker about meeting at the park. We talked and not about work. I realized that outside of work, I don’t do anything but talk about work. It felt good to just talk with someone about not work.

I still feel like shit. I want to let the guy from the second job that I did not even start at, what happened and how there is no way I could manage that much. I was very optimistic and excited until it was time and I basically blanked out on life.

I'm feeling so intolerant of this change in my life. I honestly do not care about money enough to do this. My entire schedule has changed and I really don't like it. How do I cope when I'm getting into a career that I don't want?

I'm a chronic full time work quiter. I hate the idea of it. Hours and hours of pretending to be interested and masking the entire time. I want to be back on pool deck where nobody bothered me and I occasionally saved a life.

But I need a higher income. Is the trade off that I'll be more miserable for more money? This isn't freedom, this is capitalist control",1

"I need to vent, here are some things I’d do at my job if I were put in a general management position at my main job 
I would finally have a sit down with my shift managers and assistant managers and go over some things

1. First things first, I would immediately sit down with my shift managers and tell them they are no longer allowed to pick favorites and they don’t get to pick and choose to enforce policies on an arbitrary basis anymore. I consider this a form of misconduct coming from a shift manager and it will now be a discipline able offense. From now on they must enforce the policies on an equal basis.

2. If you are caught using your position as a member of management to intimidate, harass, or bully, you will be immediately demoted and suspended for a week without pay pending a decision to either let you go or keep you around.

3. If the average employee would get written up for something, you will too. Your status as a manager means nothing in terms of special treatment if you are caught violating company policy.",1

"I don't know where else to say this, but I'm sure you guys can understand For context: I tend to have 3 special interests going at any given time. The first two spots are for Transformers and Sonic The Hedgehog, but spot #3 usually shifts around. Right now, it's Vtubers and Vtubing in general. When I found Vtubers, it actually felt like I found others of my kind. I was in awe at how they were able to find love and support from both their fans and other Vtubers for being themselves and it made me want to seek out that same kind of connection (you can probably tell where this is going).

Let me state right here that I'm aware of what a parasocial relationship is and I practice keeping that distance between myself and them, lest I become a stalker that gets the cops on his @$s. That being said, lately I've found that if a group of Vtubers start to talk and laugh and have a good time in general, or if a singular Vtuber starts talking about other Vtubers they know, I get such a sense of FOMO that I sometimes have to turn them off to avoid going into a depressive slump for hours. I'm active where they are and I'm putting in streams (though because I have a full time job, I can only really stream once a week at the most), and I understand that it'll take time for me to gain ground, but part of me is still impatient and pushing for the connection to happen now and it's every bit as annoying as the near crippling feelings of loneliness I get from watching them.

If we never had amygdalas, then humans would be more tamer. This means we would never retaliate against our enemies from all walks of life or do ridiculous things. I understand that being called immature is what the naysayers believes. But, it's hard not to take people's opinions too personal.

"Take great care with how you medicate **This post isn't about soliciting medical advice or providing it, I'm just giving my observation and experience.**

Amphetamines and ADHD medication largely turned me into a terrible human and caused bouts of inhumanity in me.

It's euphoric, and I confused that euphoria with ""wow this is working magic on me.""

I really evaluate how I interact with others on speed and how I conduct myself in public settings, and it's like yes I am disinhibited and that makes me feel like being more social and I have all this energy, but the things I say and do aren't necessarily... I mean at best unbecoming at worst wired and hurtful.

It doesn't really give me empathy, there are things that do (**some of you might know what these are**) but it's more of like taking out a loan for my energy reserves.

I did a lot of prescription speed to get through college, and can honestly say it affected my chemistry in away that I'm just sort of recovering from.

I've found certain GABA-genic substances to be better at giving me energy and for recovery (**burn out**), but these also have their drawbacks in the form of increased aggression and irritability.

Like does anyone else have something that they loved and put a lot of time and energy into that they felt was part of who they are but no longer feel like they can be a part of? I have made this realization that a feel this way with a hobby/special interest of mine. I used to be really into going to anime conventions and cosplay. I don’t go to as many cons anymore which I just save up and go to out of state ones but I no longer cosplay anymore either. I used to love it. It was a way to make new friends.

It felt like I had finally found a space where people didn’t care that  I was autistic. But it ended up being like everything else. The people who didn’t know I was autistic would eventually use my quirks and/or stims and other things against me. Growing up I had quite a few mental health issues(still do but I’m finally in therapy now)and was not medication properly so sometimes I would get into a really depressive episode at a convention or meet up and would vent to someone I thought was my friend and that would be used against me. This didn’t happen very often but it really only took me letting my guard down like once or twice. Eventually people started calling me “extremely mentally unstable” and a “stalker”. Mind you most of these people would preach love and acceptance for neurodivergent people like us, but a lot of people don’t seem to put it into practice. Most of these people were cosplayers. Honestly I really wish I could do those interactions again with what I know now. Maybe I wouldn’t have a large number of people who think poorly of me. Maybe I would still be able to cosplay or think about cosplay without getting severely upset. Maybe seeing the people I once called friends in cosplay wouldn’t bother me either. Who knows?

I can feel emotions directly from observing other people's body language, but I'm unnable to tell if they are real or fake, or if I'm reading them correctly.

I'm incapable of acting my body language, there are LOTS of micro expressions I don't realize I'm doing that just make my acting obviously fake for everyone... Those micro expressions also make people understand things that I'm not feeling...

I also don't know which expression causes which emotion in others, and neither which emotion causes others to perform which action. So, I don't even try.

"How do you even find out what your support needs are? I often see people that are low support needs/high functioning talk about the ""Oh but you don't look like you have autism"" reaction they tend to get from people.

I can't really relate to that, most people are not at all surprised to know I'm autistic, and I only looked into it in the first place when I was told I seemed like I was autistic.

I was thinking about this recently, and it occurred to me that I've just assumed I have low support needs this whole time... But I guess I don't know for sure?

I'm able to get jobs and keep jobs as long as the people in charge don't mind my general social behavior (I don't behave in a way that harms, I just struggle to talk much, apparently my facial expressions aren't ""normal"", I usually need extra explanation, etc).

But I've never gotten past the job interview stage without someone vouching for me, I've had places go from dead set on hiring me to quietly rejecting me just based on the part where they actually meet me in person.

People tend to scare me so much I go through periods of reclusiveness, I've been basically a shut-in since 2020 and it's not letting up.

I'm capable of taking care of myself, I mean I guess I am. Physically I can do dishes or whatever and I know how to do it, but working full time drains me so much that I can't do anything after work. My partner does a lot of the household work on work days, and he goes out to get groceries and such too.

I don't think I'd be surviving or remotely okay if I didn't have him looking out for me. I dunno. I wonder if I'm someone that has more support needs that's been essentially playing pretend at needing less.

But that also feels wrong to think because there's still so much I don't necessarily need help with, like I'm just trying to prove and justify that I have it hard or something.

"How does it make you feel being corrected or fixed by your partner/spouse? I am a recent late diagnosed 50 year old male with ASD L1 who was always a little quirky, odd, weird or unconventional. I found ways to navigate the world unknowing that I am autistic and thinking it was just a severe learning disability and I avoided my weaknesses and played to my strengths.

So this past spring My wife of 10+ years suggested I go for diagnostic testing after reading a Tony Attwood article about the trials and tribulations of being married to autistic husband.  

It was confirmed  yes, indeed I am autistic and have been autistic all my life. I flash through my memories and rehash and reflect now, knowing that what I mistook for personality were really just autistic traits. My thoughts and inner dialogue all fit  in to a DSM-5 criteria and framework. I am working at accepting the fact that being autistic makes me tough to live with and that my traits have had an impact on the lives of my wife and daughter.  

But since my diagnosis my wife talks to me slower,  and uses her teachers’s  voice on me, with some hope of correcting me or fixing me. It leaves me feeling worthless and damaged. I am asked not talk about my fixations, politics, economics, technology or futurism. I am not permitted to participate in choosing what to watch with family on TV. I am no longer allowed to spend time alone on my own as it is anti-social to the family. My prior carefree ignorance is now replaced by being reminded that it is me that must fit in with the family and that I must now work on changing or overcoming my challenges.  

We are in couples therapy with a great autism aware psychologist who helps,  but I feel my wife carries shame and guilt from the sessions as she learns more about how I feel about being infantilized and demeaned.All the while she was hoping to address her needs for normal living,displays of affection and modifying my shortcomings and my lack of perceived warmth.

I am at loss,  I don’t want to be fixed, I am slowly letting my masking down and vocalizing my thoughts  and experiences and becoming more comfortable in what was humbling awkwardness and quirkiness to a mature sense of knowing myself,recognizing my triggers, understanding the energy I give off, knowing that I will always show contempt for authority and the status quo. 

I would like to continue their journey with my wife but her plan to fix me is only pushing me away.  

Does anyone else have people close to them only want to fix them and reduce their autistic traits? How have you addressed it or over come it? Is there any hope to this?",1

the other moved to a different state but she's here to visit her family since december, and i said i wanted to see her. i kept asking until she said she doesn't want to go out with me because she wasn't feeling good, so she wouldn't be a nice person to hang out with. she said she'll text me when she's better, but i've been waiting for over a month. plus, i see her going out to a bunch of places with her family on her stories. 

we didn't have any fight nor disagreements, and when they answer my texts they are always kind and loving. but they don't talk to me if i'm not the one texting first. and i don't know if they don't want/can't meet anyone or just me. 

i don't want to lose them as friends. but i prefer that than fighting for people who no longer care for me as much as i care for them.

should i be straightforward and ask if something's wrong, should i just keep being the one taking initiatives or should i just let them go and if they like me they'll say something?",1
"Feeling bad due to inability to work in-person I'm looking for work and I am unable to work in-person due to various issues like sensory issues, issues travelling and especially social and emotional overwhelm with being in-person at work and seeing and interacting with so many people.

This has recently made me feel very bad about myself and like I am less than those people who can, and it also rules me out of a lot of jobs. It makes me feel like I'm not really good for anything.

I tried to disclose this to someone close to me but they wrote me off, saying they couldn't understand why it was so hard for me. It made me feel even worse, and like I shouldn't be feeling this way in the first place.

Does anyone else have a similar issue?",1
"How to you deal with traveling and flying? I promised myself that I would go on vacation this year as a way to force myself out of my comfort zone. Something I probably share with a lot of people on this sub is that I am really anxious when it comes to travel, and especially flying. I rarely even leave my own neighborhood and I have only flown a handful of times in my life, all short flight within the country, and they have all been miserable. But now I'm going on a longer trip and I think the flight is around 5 hours long

I have read a bit online and even though there is a lot of information out there, it all seems kinda ""vague"". One advice is to get noise cancelling headphones, but what music should I listen to to calm me down and also drown out the plane noises? It also say that I can get anxiety medication, but what if my doctor doesn't feel like it's something worth giving me?

The place I'm going to is a very safe, it's safer than my own country, I am also well aware how safe flying is. These aren't things I'm worried about, but the stress of the trip itself is what is and I want to figure out how I can better deal with it

"Unmasking and asking for help might ruin my relationship I'm not even asking my partner for the help really.  We long ago setup our living arrangement with roommates, we all share mortgage costs, etc. If I'm approved for benefits (may take up to six months ffs) I will be able to continue paying my fair share.

Problem is my partner feels convinced I won't be approved.  He has no serious basis of knowledge for that belief, far from an expert, I'm not sure he even has ever known an SSI recipient.  I'm no expert either, but I'm running out of energy and patience with, well, everything, I can't make it anymore, and I think he really feels baited and switched because when he met me was I was doing good, masking so well I didn't even know I was masking, thought perhaps I had finally figured life out and I wouldn't be depressed anymore, in cycles, like I always have been.

So when I felt into a depression cycle again anyway, a different partner convinced me to consider autism.  In sum, in short order, I was convinced I was autistic, I got diagnosed major depression/general anxiety/""high functioning autism,"" and for the first time I thought with that new addition to my health file I might actually able to satisfy some gate keepers to assistance resources.

I never really tried to ask for help all the many years of on and off depression because I felt being ""just"" depressed and anxious would is largely relegated to a second class health issue and is frequently not assisted.  Now that my partner is so doubtful (and even upset about it) I can't even remember why I thought that maybe being ""depressed, anxious *and* autistic"" might give me a much better shot at assistance than being ""just"" depressed/anxious.

My diagnosis report narrative very well explains why my condition prevents me from working and my partner hasn't even read it, he doesn't want to, though I've offered.  So I don't really value his prediction too much about whether I will be approved; he doesn't seem to be investing much intellect in his judgment, so whatever.  I think it's just he fears that I will someday in the future ask for some help here or there from him -- I haven't even done so at all yet -- and he's just trying to stay several steps ahead of that moment.  Some partner, eh. He's actually fine, he's just very in touch with how selfish he needs to be, and I don't really judge it. I think it's mostly healthy for him to be guarded, as hurtful as it is to me.

As a practical matter, his lack of support in this might lead him to breaking up with me way before I'm even approved or denied benefits.  So like, I was already stressed about the possibility of being denied, but that's like August.  I got a lot of things to stress about between my partner and between today and then.

Severely second-guessing the encouragement I received to unmask and ask for the help I think I need. When I had hope a autism diagnosis would help me request assistance more effectively, I had a week or two of good health, good vibes.  But my partner's doubts--I've been a wreck for a week now, and since we just had another frustrating conversation I'm afraid I got at least another week of this, which probably only makes him all the more disappointed and fearful.",1

And like, I have verbal diarrhoea a lot(!!) which I actually thought was my ADHD until today because I always got told (even by drs) that people with Asperger’s aren’t good at talking to people, but I don’t know how to stop! And because of it people always tell me “oh I’d never be able to tell!”

"Just another weird example of low social status I have been going to a crossfit gym for over a year now. There are limited weight rack slots so sometimes we need to share. I was there early so I got a spot to myself. Someone coming later had no slot so they came up to me. I said I would be happy to share with them. They told me they didn't think that would work as our heights are too different and that I should move(or something along those lines). I gave in and moved to someones spot who offered to share with me.  


But why should I have moved. I was there first. I am 5'10 the person asking was around 5'8 I ended up paired with was around 6 feet. The person who kicked me was a woman but there were other women there she could have shared with. We also both lift nearly identically and the person I ended up with lifts much more so it was much more inconvenient.  


I guess you could just say well she  just happened to be an asshole. But why go after me. I guess I could have argued. But that tends to go horribly. And I have never seen other people argue about spots in the gym.  


Maybe its based on previous behavior but I tend to just keep my head down and work hard. Sometimes make minor chit chat with people.  


I don't know why I am choosing to post this one. These kinds of just strange example of being placed at low social status happen to me all the time and with basically everyone I come across over a long enough time line. Which is why I don't even really have any anger toward the person that did it to me. Because everyone seems to do similar things to me even when they don't to other people.

"The dating market for autistic people is non existent I just came to a realisation that Asperger’s is pretty much seen as a turn off for 90% + of potential suitors. I’m addition to the fact that dating is damn impossible even for “ordinary” NTs who have better social skills.

Any time I have added it into face to face conversation a few dates in (I am extremely good at masking in person) they have immediately ghosted me because they see it as some sort of liability or that I am “not all there”.

I get the; “you are a great guy but it just won’t work out”. Like bro? 5 minutes ago you were sat in my apartment eating my food and now you think I’m weird.

And I’ve said before; “did you even notice I was autistic” and their response is often “I had no idea” or “that’s strange you don’t look autistic”…. As if you can see autism.

Especially now with social media. I feel that unless you are the alpha male that has loads of friends and a huge social influence you are seen as a “red flag”.

The sad reality is that I am never going to be that person. I am quiet. Would rather stay in. And just live a relaxed life that very few seem to understand. 

It is honestly soul destroying. I have a few friends who have struggled with dating and they aren’t even on the spectrum. So when I tell them about my issues they just say; “damn dude, that’s so brutal, you are the chillest person I know”.

I honestly think if people were rejected as much as those with Asperger’s there would be outcry in the media. But because nobody cares, we are almost ignored.",1

If I am lucky enough to get a date, I am very shy and it takes me a while to warm up to new people, so I feel like a date just isn’t enough time, and I have a stutter issue in addition to my Asperger’s makes it damn near impossible.

It’s almost like I need to know the person before I date them, which brings me to my next thing, I had my eye on this girl for a while, but recently found out she is moving in a few months, she is also a friend that has Asperger’s, she is the only other person with Asperger’s that I know down here (which is why I thought it might work)— so I guess I can rule out the “ knowing someone before” idea.

I know I can *seem* selfish sometimes, but now I know that I have nothing but the best intentions for everyone which includes myself.  I just have a different way of showing it because... well idk... its just the way my brain is and I'm tired of trying to adapt my 🔺 brain in this 🔹 world.

I understand, now, that my slight oddness around others has caused misunderstandings and not all misunderstandings can be immediately solved. And that's okay. Its a part of life.

Hi all, when I was 8 years old I went to see someone for 2 days a week & unbeknownst to me my parents were told I had aspergers by that person (i'm not familiar with them and remember very little about them but they were a licensed professional), I then took time out of school to go to a ""workshop"" for socializing & got placed into the special education class at my private school (which I was taken out of after telling my mum about it being annoying (she had no idea I had been placed into the class)).

At 14 I was rock climbing with my dad and he brought it up thinking that my mum had told me shortly after my diagnosis.

I'm now 18 and have started to become more open about it, coming here and reading other peoples posts here about aspergers I do find myself relating to a lot of what is said, however I can't shake the feeling that my diagnosis was wrong & that the qualities that led to my diagnosis are just personality traits.

I'm in Australia NSW and thinking about asking my GP about getting re-diagnosed however i'm wary that it will end up being a waste of time & possible money and I'm nervous about speaking to a professional about my life.

1.most  important,   although i wasn't raised economically disadvantaged i always had a  severe anxiety of my possessions ,the only thing i have control over,  getting stolen. Which now has led me into not believing that my door is  locked after i lock it. I genuinely dont believe that my door is locked ,  i even have a permanent bruise on my hipbone cause i keep smacking them  against the door to check that it is locked

2.i  live in a sucky area  and there is a creepy guy (s) who keep trying to  chat me up and i always see em , and yes it does trigger previous trauma  i even  had a sa nightmare recently

3.  i haven't done any work for school and i am embarrassed and anxious to  ask about what i missed . also having to deal with explaining why i  didn't show up ( i also had dental issues which i am going to use as the reason i didnt show up but it is still hard for me to  talk to people)",1

I hate skirts, dresses or slim pants, they are so uncomfortable and I wouldn't wear them even if it's the only thing I have at home.

"Cognitive Empathy Among Individuals With High-Functioning Autism or Asperger's? Hello everyone. I hope you are doing well. Newly diagnosed Aspie here. Everything, including my past behaviour and traits, makes much more sense now, but I'm still trying to understand it better. In this post I'll describe something that I've always had but others have not, like several other things that made me feel different, but I'm unsure if all people with Autism have it, so I'll explain what it is now.

I always intuitively knew it, but I recently came across a TED talk titled 'Empathy and Asperger’s Syndrome' by Dylan Dailor, who is also autistic, and that's when it clicked in my brain. I have always had empathy for others, but the sort of empathy I have seems very different from other people, judging from observations from my personal experiences and the way the behave.

In brief, the speaker explains that there are two kinds of empathy- Cognitive and Affective. From   
 my understanding, Affective empathy is you ability to feel and experience what the other person might be going through, whereas Cognitive empathy is your ability to think about all the external factors that might have played a role in compelling the person to act the way they did. 

So affective empathy would be more grounded in emotions and dependent on the emotional affect that certain words produce, so maybe that's why Autistic people are lower on it, and on the other hand cognitive empathy requires you to ty to understand the thought process of the person logically, which is also Autistic people seem to be good at. 

At least that's the case for me. He also says that having high-functioning autism means that he is high on cognitive empathy but relatively low on affective empathy. I have some interesting ideas about how cognitive empathy could be increased in NTs and affective empathy in NDs, and how both of them compare with each other, but that's a topic for another day. 

I just wanted to ask if anyone here feels the same, can relate with what I said, or thinks that they are also high in cognitive empathy relative to affective empathy and are able to notice the difference in other people just the way I am able to. Kind of how you can understand everyone and have empathy for everyone, regardless of what the majority thinks.

To be more specific, irrespective of the prevalent social norms and social constructs, if you are able to think about such things with logic and reason, empathize with everyone, and believe that everyone deserves to be loved and that we should have compassion for every being on the planet. Or not, but the main point is that you don't feel different depending on the emotional affect it happens to produce in you and most people. 

Which is why you probably would have the same measure for everyone and are able to be more logical (and also scrutinize your own emotions with logic) where people rely on emotions, and where some even think that logic has no place, which in my opinion is just a result of misunderstanding logic, a very narrow definition of logic, a different definition of ""logic"" or simply a matter of different values, inclinations or priorities.

To be honest, I'm not even sure if that's what the two types of empathy mean, or if that's what Dylan was trying to convey in the TEDx talk, but still it is something that I notice very frequently and believe to be one of the more important topics that, if we could understand, could help us create a better society and be better human beings, ""better"" of course being subjective and open to interpretation based on your own beliefs and values, because there probably isn't one single best thing to do, but that's my opinion and I am open to changing my mind in light of contradictory logical reasons or evidence.

I'm just guessing here what it could be, because I can only talk about myself, and I'm absolutely not saying that any one worldview is superior to the other, because both kinds of empathy are necessary in certain amounts and we need both to be able to understand each other, but I'm curious about what you feel about this, your stance on this topic, and your thoughts on having empathy. Feel free to share any comments you feel like sharing.",1
"[I need your help] Is anyone from the Balkans in this community? **Or perhaps you know someone who is?**

This is really important to me and possibly thousands of other people...

In every local community posted about this, I experienced ableism, so seems like there is no such thing as autism awareness here. The only replies I received were insults about how I'm striving to be something unique and special, unironically coming from the same people who mocked and bullied me in school for being ""retarded"".

The diagnosing criteria are quite outdated over here, and I've only heard about negative experiences with the diagnostic process (and the invalidation of what we're going through). I've never met an adult who has been diagnosed with ASD!

I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me in **reaching out to more people** and hopefully connecting with someone.

"I just realized I have been given social security money my whole life and I am shaking and crying To make a very long and horrible life ruining story short, I was diagnosed with ASD when before I was ever even in school for some reason and was put in special ed my whole life with the slightest exception being a very horrible self righteous inclusion program I was in from the 4th-8th grade despite being what you would call ""high functioning"" and funny enough, once I got into a high school that treated their students like humans and I started using social media, I quickly picked up on social expectations and I barely matched any symptoms which I believe would imply that any symptom I did match was just the result of me being so sheltered and traumatized. So reasonably, I would be very upset at the realization that the money my mom gave me as daily allowance throughout all of high school, came from social security, and when I looked up why that would be the case, I discovered something called SSI which is given to autistic children if they meet severe deficits in certain areas. I keep getting surprised at just how low expectations were for me and the worst part is, they have to be right if I was diagnosed so young, something I could not control had to have been noticed to declare that I could not be in the same classroom as all the potential friends I could have had and that I was deemed that defective. I just want to be normal, why will no one give me the chance to be normal

Edit: for what ever reason, alot of you are solely focusing on the social security aspect and are conveniently ignoring the part where I brought how it was yet another example of me realizing just how little faith was placed on me and my own uncertainty on my identity.

I have also been able to sense attraction between two people. I can almost immediately tell when another person is autistic as well- not because of anything they’re doing, but it’s just a vague “impression” I get. but if someone tells me a deadpan joke I’ll think they’re being serious, lol.

I have only had him back a few weeks now but I am wondering if this has been an issue with any of yall.

"having a hard time keeping my emotions from showing on my face and people think my facial expressions look funny ?? My facial expressions are very exaggerated and show everything i'm feeling. It's very hard for me to hide my emotions. Often I'm making a face at something going on in my head and I also make facial expressions that get read weird (when I'm trying hard to pay attention or concentrating really hard, but also just in general). It's just that i cant hide my emotions at all and everything shows on my face (except for when i'm really overstimulated or tired). The way my emotions show looks off/funny to other people though. Some people say outright that they look funny or weird. Other times i've literally been bullied and people have mimicked my expressions. This applies to positive and negative emotions i cant hide either. Moreover i have a really animated reaction to being startled and i get startled  extremely easily.

Does anyone else have the same problem ?

"What do yall do for work? I'm 27, I started working at 16 out of necessity.

"Anyone else not like the superiority complex by other people on the spectrum? Not to say everyone in the ASD community feels this way, but some do and for me it is puzzling and even makes me shake my head. For me, I am one of the autistic people who wishes they weren't on the spectrum. Not grasping social skills and having restrictive interests led to a lack of formative social experience in my K-12 years, particularly during middle/high school. Not only has it made life feel empty considering I wanted genuine connection with others but also even though I socialize better now I very feel inexperienced than if I had actually had friends and participated in activities in my youth instead of being a homebody. Plus the fact I just got diagnosed with ADHD at age 22 explains my academic difficulties and overall troubles with procrastination and focusing on things. Plus with how dysfunctional my family was, I needed to have healthy outlets or an escape from it all but of course because of these conditions I was fighting a losing battle on two fronts between home and school.

Despite this, there seems to be the idea that I am still better off this way because I allegedly have a unique perspective compared to neurotypicals. This is what I have been told if I was born neurotypical:

>Probably very boring. Part of overcoming the social limitation of autism is watching and learning how ""normal"" people act. When you spend enough time watching people that live their life through trends and media influence, you realize just how soul suckingly demotivating ""normal"" people can be. They don't think, they don't rationalize, they just consume and regurgitate what they're fed. Generally speaking, of course, not all non-ND people fit this mold.

Then there is this:

>Ah great, another autistic sob story. I’m autistic too, and I’ve seen it as a positive all my life. Neurotypicals are, by and large, completely incapable of thinking for themselves, having their own interests, figuring out how to do shit on their own, etc., and it really annoys me to see my fellow autistics making it seem like autism is a curse. Like, dude - you’re blessed with being able to “be yourself” without having to have it hammered in by the media! You’re a unique individual! What’s not to love about that?

Well gee, maybe that is because I genuinely wanted to connect with people instead of weirding them out or pissing them off with my legitimately faux pas habits. And seeing how I was basically a complete homebody in middle/high school(minus church youth group in MS) with no extracurriculars, shitty grades, just browsed Reddit or Youtube at home and walked around campus alone at school saying I was the one who wasn't boring would be very disingenuous. Plus with my desired career goal to work in emergency services, understanding people and proper communication is absolutely essential. Thank God I don't have the sensory issues others talk about or I would be even more behind.

But that is overrated to some. If one genuinely benefits from their autism more power to you. But not all of us are in that boat.And you don't need to have debilitating mental conditions to be unique, plenty of neurotypical people don't abide by conventional norms or stereotypes in certain ways.

"Could Harry Potter-Evans-Verres from HPMOR have Autism? Hello everyone. I hope you are doing well. I recently got diagnosed with high-functioning Autism, and everything makes much more sense now. I also realized how several personalities, real and fictional, whose some specific traits or qualities I had admired also happen to have Autism or at least display traits associated with high-functioning autism, but I never realized that before I started noticing it in myself. This brings me to one character from one of my all-time favourite books, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eleizer Yudkowsky. 

Just like this version of Harry (he's a Ravenclaw in the book), I happen to be obsessed with logic, rationality and the scientific method, and socially withdrawn and eccentric (as people have told me) so he is one of the very few characters I could actually relate with. 

Also the way he applies the scientific method everywhere, even issues related to morality and ethics, and I am pleasantly surprised whenever I decide to give my notes from the book another read and discover that it closely resembles some topic I'd already written about. 

I just wanted to ask if anyone here who has read the book thinks that he might be autistic. Now, it's not as if I care, and it's very uncharacteristic of me to spend my time on such matters instead of learning, reading, writing or doing something more productive.

But I thought that I'd ask just for fun, and to spark a discussion among people from the community who have read the book, which nicely combines elements of fantasy fiction with legitimate science and the methods of rationality, and serves the purpose of both education as well as escapism. I'd recommend it to those who haven't read it.",1

"I feel my parents don’t validate me I was born in a very traditional Christian family. I made a lot of efforts to socialize to have friends and girlfriends.

I’m 31 M currently have a 23 yo gf. 

During my twenties I managed with my efforts to be accepted in one of the best design school in the world. I graduated with success. Managed to have some dates, gfs, and ons. I’ve been constantly out of my comfort zone to live like NTs. I’ve learned a lot of skills to mask, to seduce and attract people.

I’m now building a cryptocurrency startup company based in Switzerland with investors based in Amsterdam, Zurich and Oslo. 

For me all of this is a big success. 

I have 3-4 friends but I’m not sure if they are real or just with me for their interests.

Of course in my life I didn’t have lived the typical christian way. I’m not married yet, I don’t have kids. And for them that’s a problem. Unfortunately I’m not living in a religious way. 

I told them I was happy with all my sexual experiences. To them it like a sin. I have some struggle to maintain a long relationship and I’m doing my best to have the best healthy relationships. 

They always been doubting about my choices and they are still doubting.

They actually live in an another country and when I meet them, I’m just myself but sadly I can’t connect with them. Sad for them my life is not a Disney/Christian  story but my story. 

This makes me sad because they just think God gave me all the success but don’t see the efforts I made…

- taking frequent long walks at work to break up the day
- Listen to music/podcasts/tv shows while working with noise cancelling headphones (lately, I am having an issue where I can’t concentrate on any content - tv shows, movies,books etc.)
- Get up and stretch

I'm currently hitting the gym to be in very good shape, and started talking care of my physical appearence. But, I know damn well that this won't help me get closer to people. I just want to have someone to talk to and joke around with.

"How has anyone here found a partner (gf/bf etc)? The last time I ever had a legitimate relationship was in high school. It lasted only a few months and we didn't really go much farther than a kissing/hugging. 

Since then I've had absolutely no luck with dating. I'm not the worst looking guy.. Actually if I'm taking care of myself I've been told that I'm good looking even. All that has very little meaning when you come across as ""creepy and weird"". At a certain point that ""Oh, he's mysterious and quiet"" always becomes ""Wow, he's pretty strange and my fight or flight is telling me to get out of here."". 

Tinder is a nightmare, hinge is a nightmare, all the dating apps are so neuro-typical centered that I never seem to be able to find anyone I can relate to or that I know wouldn't be freaked out by my ""weirdness"" and awkwardness.  

I've grown up with such a mixed bag on my appearance and how I'm perceived in attractiveness, mostly due to bullying when I was younger. It really screwed up my self worth and self image. There were times when I was younger and at bars that I've had a girl come up to me and ask to come back to their place, while other times being told that I have ""school shooter energy"".  It still amazes me how cruel people can be. 

Sorry for the rant. I just hate that I feel doomed to this weird existence where I'm almost good enough, but not quite for relationships.",1
"Can't stand but also secretly like when NTs share interests? So for ages now there's been an NT I know who is the typical popular, attractive, athletic etc whatever boring things, also some of the highest grades in school. Basically my special interest he also knows a lot about and I resent him for it as it essentially makes me a useless person because he can do everything I can do but also what everyone else can and more so what's the point of me. But I don't think I actually am as angry as I think I am when I tell myself this. I almost think I slightly like it.

"Dirty spaces drive me crazy cleaning does too Im autistic but i also have ocd and cant really tell if its one or the other or an overlap between the two. Im not the cleanest person and i dont clean obsessively but i clean for work and maintain my spaces with my own level of organization. I seem to be okay when i have gloves at work and have to clean my own messes (dishes, clothes etc) but i changes gloves frequently maybe more frequently than is necessary and i freeze up when it comes to messes made by other people. 

I have a strong aversion to washing dishes especially if theres food still on them. I hate dirty water but i just hate dirty spaces in general especially sensitive areas that should be kept sterile like kitchens and bathrooms. Recently i visited my long distance girlfriend for the first time and her house was a sensory nightmare for me. Messy kitchen, messy bathroom, puppy that wasnt potty trained and used the floor as his toilet. I didn’t know how to address it and have been wondering is this is a manifestation of my sensory issues or if im just being “judgmental” and “stuck up” as people describe me. 

The pee on the floor, hair, and food stains just made me feel contaminated and dirty. I felt like the longer i stayed in that space the more i became it and felt paranoid or worried about catching diseases or infections. I also grew up in a few infested places so i was constantly checking for bugs or having tactile hallucinations of bugs crawling around my body. Im confident its bigger than me just being a judgmental asshole but i know i can easily come across that way. I want to bring it up to her and i will but i also know i have to face the nightmare if im gonna keep the space to my standards or be in public areas that arent well maintained. 

Any tips for handling these sensitive conversations or dealing with the stress of sensory overload when in messy spaces would be helpful. Im thinking of having a box of gloves with me at all times or wearing more clothes that cover my entire body so i dont have to worry about something i dont like touching my skin.",1

"Autism makes me want to give up on romance Since I'm only 20 I guess this seems a little dramatic but it's something I can't help but think. Women just don't find me attractive. I have no romantic experience. I'm not ugly so I don't know what it is. Is it my body language? My conversation skills? My stimming? Maybe I should to try to stop stimming so people won't think I'm awkward. I wish I knew exactly what my problem was. I don't think a woman has even flirted with me. Either that or I'm unbelievably bad at picking up signals. I don't usually cry but it's really upsetting for me that women want nothing to do with me and that I must be so unattractive that no one thinks I'm worthy to date.

Maybe I should just stop trying. I tried approaching women in school but in hindsight I think they were uncomfortable because of how anxious and awkward I was. I hate the fact that I probably made them uncomfortable. My mom said I would be begging to be single again if I got a girlfriend and the relationships in my life that I've seen has been nothing but dysfunctional so maybe I should just give up on the idea. I just wish I knew what it felt like to be desired for and to hold hands with someone.",1

"Have anyone here experienced CBT tailored for treating people with ASD? Hi all,

I've previously received mental health treatment for anxiety and depression however have been rather disappointed with the lack of progress I have seen from treatment. 

It was suggested to me by a community mental health practitioner that people that have ASD require tailored CBT to address their specific needs. 

I'd love to know if anyone here has experienced such treatment modalities for anxiety and depression and did you find them more effective than conventional CBT?

"ASD related insomnia (Pardon my poor English) I wanted to come here to ask if anyone else have got insomnia based on their ASD?

I have had insomnia for about ever since I was born. But got diagnosed in 2019, by my doctor, after trying all types of therapy and many types of medications for a couple of years. We tried to get me into a insomnia clinic, but my country doesn’t care for good mental health, so we gave up. So he took an valuation and gave me the diagnosis himself.
I got diagnosed with Asperger’s for about 2 years ago. And after a lot of realization my doctor now believes that my insomnia might be because of my autism. But we can’t really know for sure before I see a professional on insomnia.

But yeah, I wanted to ask if someone are experiencing something similar? And if so is there a cure?",1
"I think my boyfriend is eventually going to break up with me So, I had what I thought was a perfect relationship. He was aware of my diagnosis and I felt like he accepted me with all the good and bad parts of my personality.

But one day I had a meltdown in front of him. It was not because of him, it was certainly not his fault at all. It was something related to work what threw me off. If I had been by myself I would have had the same reaction. I had a meltdown and he just happened to be there and witnessed the whole thing without knowing what to do.

I was almost sure he was going to break up with me that day, but he didn't. 

Since that day things started to get weird. He said that I was too distant and wasn't putting a lot of effort in the relationship, and he felt like I wasn't interested anymore. I felt like I was putting the exact same amount of effort as always. So I made an extra effort to be more invested in the relationship, and two weeks later he tells me we might have to break up because I never texted him back immediately so he assumed I was ignoring him. This took me by surprise because I thought I was making a big effort in giving him attention, but I also explained to him that I have a job, and I have to like… be there, and looking at my phone every 5 minutes is not something that I'm allowed to do. Besides that, I get distracted very easily so I purposefully put my phone in silent mode so I don't have to listen to all the notifications. 

When we started dating, I told him that I'm not good at texting and prefer real life interactions. He was ok with it. He used to be ok with the fact that I responded to his texts 5 hours later and that sometimes I would just send random stickers because I don't know how to react in a text format. It was never a problem before, and I can't help but think that after my meltdown he started to reconsider this relationship because my autism is not just being funny and quirky and socially unaware in a cute way, it also involves other symptoms that are very serious, and he should have been aware since the moment I told him about my diagnosis because he has a sibling that is also on the spectrum, so I assumed he would know one thing or two about dealing with neuro divergent people.

Anyways, he didn't break up with me that day but keeps acting weird and I just think he will come up with some other random excuse to put a hypothetical break up on the table again. I don't want to break up with him but at the same time there's a part of me who wants to break up first and run away because I don't want to be constantly tested and feel like I'm not enough to my partner. I am done feeling like I disappoint everyone in my life for being who I am, because I will never be neurotypical enough for them. 

I just wanted to know if you've had similar experiences with relationships and if you were able to figure something out.",1
"Two days ago I was fired from the best job I've ever had. I was fired on Thursday from my job as a barista at a coffeeshop. I really loved this place and I am devastated.

It was completely out of the blue but I and the rest of my coworkers were regularly treated poorly by our micromanaging boss.

I performed well there. I loved my coworkers and was super fond of the customers, especially the regulars. I felt like I was part of my community. It was the sole workplace where I ever felt comfortable being my authentic self and openly autistic.

I was fired last night because I had taken pastries without paying. Everyone did. I thought that was okay with management, especially considering, with some of the other managers, I had asked them about it before and it was fine.

It felt like a police interrogation. I was treated like a thief, like I set out to do this in flagrant disregard of the rules. I was told to leave and to hand over my store keys, even after I pleaded, apologizing, saying I'd never do it again. No warning, no prior communication that this was a hard policy.

He had gone through the transaction logs over the course of weeks, and through the camera footage throughout the week. It stressed me out a while before because we were aware he was constantly monitoring us. It never felt like he really trusted us. But I honest to god really didn't think that he had an issue with us eating the pastries. He never ever brought it up to me before.

He kept saying I stole from him, instead of ""us"" or ""the store"".

I am shattered. I could hardly sleep last night because I could not stop ruminating. it was the single most degrading experience I've ever had in a job and I've worked some awful ones.

I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to my coworkers or to the customer's who I knew for years.

I feel like he fired me because he didn't like me, or maybe because he wanted to hire a new person who he has to pay less, since I had several raises. I don't know. He definitely singled me out, I know that. It wasn't the only time I felt picked on by him and being held up to a different standard than others; I've also seen him do that to a few people in particular.

It just feels like this was escalated to an unwarranted degree and that clear communication would have solved the whole dilemma. If he told me to never do it again, I wouldn't.

I saw the pastries as part of a survival strategy. Food is getting more and more expensive and the store never matched our wages with inflation. I can barely make ends meet right now. I just wanted to get by.

Now everything is in pieces and I'm scared for the future. I built up a sense of identity here. I felt part of something I could take pride and joy in. It feels so callous that my financial livelihood was ripped out from underneath my feet.

I know I need to act and get on unemployment. I'm struggling with the grief, with the flashbacks this has triggered to every awful encounter with authority figures I've had.

I tried so hard there. I put my all into my work and relished the chance to connect with customers, to find some human warmth beyond merely a financial transaction. I feel like discarded trash.

I know I need to act now and do the legwork I need to do on unemployment and applying for new jobs. I just feel so numb. Executive dysfunction are depression combining forces and assailing me right now.",1

"I hurt a friend and betrayed her trust and i have so much guilt about it despite everyone telling me it's ok Late Last Month, I didn't know if I was coming back to school for the semester mainly due to Finacial Aid (I did) I have a friend who i grew to care about for a year now and I felt like we reached best friend status. Over Winter Break, I started to redevelop romantic feelings for her but I didn't say anything because she was rejected by her crush last semester The first Week of the semester, i still wasn't registered but I was on campus to give her her Christmas gifts. It was The Cure Shirt and a Hot Topic Exclusive Robert Smith Pop Vinyl Figure. Before me and my mom went home, dejected by the Finacial Aid Again, we went to Portillo's and I invited her. We were sitting down at our own table and my Mom was chilling on her own. My mind was still on finances and she told me she's seeing a co-worker of hers. After a month of thinking and contemplating, I thought ""no harm no foul"" I told her that my feelings for her had resurfaced. But I messed up after that. I told her that I trusted her with taking my virginity. That of course made her feel really uncomfortable and she told me it did when i got home. The following week i was able to come back but I realized I had to confront my friend sometime. I already apologized over text the same day of the confession. She said that she's glad I told her but felt trapped but knows I didn't mean any harm and that it's ok and that I didn't do anything wrong Making me think it was just a little mistake. But it wasn't. Later she said that she wasn't comfortable seeing me. a few weeks back i tried texting her to ease the tension i had but i just ended up apologizing again and i spiraled out and went to a friend for comfort and later called the Hotline (if you catch my drift). I felt like she doesn't want me here and probably hates me too. I felt like such a bad friend. last Tuesday i saw her and told her i was going to counseling (which i am more on that in a bit) and how i still felt like a bad friend and apologize for betraying the trust she put into me. I also told her that I never fantasize over her, which was true. All of the guilt was warping other's perceptions of me. I thought everyone hated me and would be better if I wasn't here. And the guilt was getting too much and i even lashed out at my mom. Anyways, when i explain the situation to a mutual friend of ours, who knows both sides. And three different therapists about it, they said that my friend acted a little extreme. The Mutual Friend even believed it to an extent. Obviously, I cant say that to her. But I still know that I fucked up and hurt a person who I really cared about platonically

Tl:DR: I confessed my feelings to my friend and despite her telling me it was ok, she's (understandably) upset with me and all the Guilt has been eating away at me",1
"My first “date” with a girl that ended horribly Hey, all! I have a lot on my mind on past experiences, and how horrible it has been to have Asperger’s. I’d like to share this story from back when I was in 7th grade, as this really exemplifies how hard and stressful my life has been.

Like I said, this all happened in 7th grade. For the first time ever, I had gotten a girl to be my girlfriend. A month after we met, we got to see each other outside of school for the first time. We saw a movie at the theater, then went to get ice cream. It was here that I started doing things that I had no clue would backfire.

At this point, I really wanted to have our first kiss(this would be my first time kissing a girl)and was hell-bent on making that happen. I got my girlfriend to go sit on a hill right next to the ice cream place, although looking back on it, I feel like I might’ve been a bit pushy about it. While I don’t really know for sure if that was much of a problem, what I do know is that it led to what happened next.

While we were sitting on the hill, we kissed 3 times. One of the times I, well, used some tongue. 

Eventually, her mom came to get her, and we went our separate ways. About an hour later, I get a text from my gf, saying that the way I kissed her was “gross” and “not ok” and that she was breaking up with me.

Her friends criticized me like it was such a grave sin that I committed. My guidance counselor did as well. 

It felt so unfair. I had no idea beforehand that anything I did would lead to this. I still have many questions to this day. Why couldn’t she tell me she didn’t like that without breaking up with me? How did everyone except me know that this was not ok?

It amazes me how harshly people in this world can be judged despite lack of intent to upset anyone.

That experience, along with many others over the years, has contributed to me questioning my self worth at times. Dating hasn’t gotten much easier in the years since. I’m now 22 and I still just can’t get a girl easily.

She feels sympathy but I feel annoyance when each of us are put in the position of having to comfort the other.  What is my problem(s) and how can I fit it?",1
"Does anyone else feel like their inner monologue hates them? It’s like I have two sides of me, one that does stupid or awkward things, and then the “reasonable” part of me that’s smart and does the right things. I feel like these sides are always fighting in my head, like I’m always screaming at myself how stupid and bad at everything I am. The reasonable side wants the unreasonable side to die. It’s not like I want to die, just that part of me. 

I’ve always felt like this and it’s been really bad recently. Sometimes I catch me talking to myself in public, mouthing awful stuff towards that side. I get really anxious when this happens and usually I start laughing to try to relieve some of the awkwardness for myself. Of course then, I realize I’m laughing for no reason in public and have to play it off. 

I hate it so much, every time something minor happens, like I say something awkward, or a girl I like doesn’t text me back, my inner monologue starts screaming at me about how much of a worthless loser I am. It’s gotten to the point where I have to excuse myself for my friends sometimes because it just gets too much. I just want to yell at myself to shut up.

It sucks being just “normal” enough to tell when I’m humiliating myself or being stupid. I’d rather have no inner monologue at all. I’d rather be lobotomized.

"how do you deal with not being ""normal""? I'm aware of how edgy it sounds, but it's basically the point of this post.

It's my birthday in a few days and I've never been the party animal. I never enjoyed dancing at parties since the way I dance is just really odd and mechanical so that's already a nono. I'm just not a fun person in that sense, but I keep seeing people around me having their parties with really lovely, fun people and I can't help but be so mad at myself I cannot _physically_ do what they're doing. I just can't get out of my shell at parties.


I have a friend and a boyfriend I'm gonna spend my birthday with, but there's also two other guys I'm not that close to but they're really nice and we get along well. Problem is, they enjoy partying and drinking and all that, which is fine, but I don't know how to please them.


I also never throw parties because it's a huge responsibility. What if they don't have fun? What if they wanna drink and I'm all quiet and boring and I'm ruining their mood? What if they want to be funny and it happens that I can't physically laugh (because I've been in so much trouble because i can't physically laugh at stuff even if they're funny)

My ideal fun night is just sitting at a table with these people. Talking and sharing funny stories because these people are so fun to be around and I'm just awkward.


What do we even do? We go somewhere and drink? I hate drinking and I don't enjoy spending time with drunk people while I'm sober.
Do we just eat? They're gonna find it lame. I know I should ""find the right people"" and all that, I really know, but for once I want to feel like there's people out there who enjoy my company and don't think I'm just a smartass who does old people activities. No, I'm not old.



Any suggestions? How do you find the balance between your favorite activities and other's?

"Friends not reaching out after a natural disaster I lived in Turkey for several years and was living in Istanbul when the 2016 coup attempt occurred. that was the most terrifying night of my life, and the handful of friends who called to ask if I was okay I viewed as close friends.   


Six and a half years later, my wife's family was affected by the recent earthquakes. Two friends of mine have said they heard nothing about it, and I believe them. But of the friends who called me in 2016, none have called now. Is this simply because I've moved back to the States since and it somehow doesn't register? Might they genuinely be unaware?

"How do you come back from burnout? I have not been doing okay in adult life and all it’s pressures. After completely destroying my soul working in an office job for 5 years, my brain literally started shutting down and I started to get extremely irritable every day after forcing myself to work for a few hours. I felt like I was banging my head against a wall just trying to make a living. so i quit. i tried to take some time off and get back to enjoying life again. But the brain fog didn't improve. I cant seem to get a good night's sleep anymore (I haven’t in 10+ years.) 

After a few months off i had to dive back in to find a way to get income again.

I can't think of a job that I would enjoy doing and I can’t stand the idea of working my life away 40 hours a week in any job and having no energy to do anything I want to do outside of that. My soul is constantly rebelling against the idea. 

All my friends have moved away and I haven’t succeeded in finding new ones. Constantly trying to be social to make new friends and failing is exhausting, especially when you have to work to live which is already so exhausting.

I was recently diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger's, and my doctor prescribed some medications to increase my ""social and emotional awareness"", and reducing my ""neurotic tendencies"". I talked to a few other people who have Asperger's, many of them from this sub who were very helpful in answering some questions I posted here not too long ago. 

And I realized that  ASD is not something that needs to be treated and there are no medications specifically for Asperger's. I also currently do not have any other comorbidities such as anxiety or depression, so I'm a bit confused, and I'd like to ask if any of you received any similar medications when you were first diagnosed. 

I believe that if I just be myself- and I'm getting better at it each day, being more at peace with who I am and harnessing my strengths instead of thinking something is wrong with me, especially after I got diagnosed and I learned that I am just different- I would eventually find similar people and be more confident as I am, without needing to pretend or conform in any situation where doing so is not required and unnecessary or irrational.

I currently do not have any problem with managing my emotions, nothing like anxiety and depression, and even though I am socially isolated, it's because of not being able to find like-minded people and preferring to be alone than in groups, and because I am unable to understand and be understood by most people, who happen to have very different preferences, interests and levels of motivation, things that make much more sense now after I came across ASD.

Just to be clear, I do trust the doctor, and I believe that he has good reasons to do so, but I like being a critical thinker and understanding why I am doing what I'm doing, even seemingly small and insignificant things that most people do not think too deeply about and that I over-analyze using logic and other decision-making tools. 

And this is something related to my own health, so you'd understand why I'm trying to be so cautious and understand the purpose of these medications, if anyone has taken similar meds, if the meds have any serious side-effects, and if I could try therapy and other psychological or behavioural tools instead, before starting the medications, which currently have been prescribed just for a month.

I intend to start taking them soon because as I said, even though I feel like I should know why I'm taking them and if it'd be a good decision to do so, but I am myself not a doctor and nor do I expect to come across many professional doctors here, so I'll have to take a leap of faith and place some trust in the professional who is an expert in this field, just like we do with scientists when we can not realistically verify the credibility of each and every new scientific discovery that is published in journals. But I thought there's not harm in asking, so I did.

I could always just stop if I feel like they're having some significant side-effects, and there is no harm in trying unless they have some permanent or long-lasting negative effect on my brain, but I estimate the probability of such an event occurring to be very low and hence such a situation to be unrealistic simply because the doctor is a professional and expert in autism. It's just my brain that won't let me rest and sleep peacefully at night until I know everything there is to know, especially if it regards my very ability to acquire and process information, and think clearly.

I'm just posting the names of the medications I've been prescribed, and I'd like to know if you happen to have taken them and have any comments. L-Theanine, Venpower, Neuron Forte, Citinova, DHEA.",1

"Update: I told my boyfriend that I’m autistic. Check my account for the original post.


More about to best friend situation: 

My best friend told me that she liked a boy and told me it was N. She then told me that her and N had a failed talking stage and were kinda friends. I then accidentally fell for N because we had most of our classes together and talked frequently. My best friend was extremely supportive since they never dated and she was over him and she helped us get together. Anytime I send my friend a message and text my boyfriend, they open the messages at the same time, and this happens often. 

Yes it was extremely crappy of me to get with N since my friend liked him and I’m aware of that. But my best friend is genuinely extremely supportive of me and loves that N and I are together and apparently they ‘always talk about me’ (their words)

Now, the update.
 
N wouldn’t talk to me at school at all. He usually always talked to me but since I told him I didn’t like to be touched, he hasn’t talked to me, not even a text. I gave him a quick kiss after school and that was it.

What should I do?",1

"I could make a list of all of the people who have “ghosted me” or rejected me in my life so far here and it would include dozens of classmates, dozens of co-workers, and perhaps 200 people on dating sites And if I ever bring it up, it’s because I’m not confident enough. Sure, my depression and anxiety keep me from driving far from home and I don’t like going out to bars, etc. I have trouble sometimes having long, interesting conversations, too. That doesn’t stop a lot of people from having partners. Something else must be going on. Sometimes it’s my height (I know bc some women told me) and the fact that I’m only good at the initial aspect of flirting and have trouble keeping it up over the long-term. It just seems corny after awhile. I’ve had several girlfriends in the past. But usually several years apart. I’ve had a few flings, also years apart.",1
"Serious question, is this burnout? I’m currently trying to seek a therapist for this but I’m uncertain if this is some type of burnout. Basically a couple months ago I was laid off. This sent my whole routine and future up in the air as I was faced with the unknowns. I had too much time to live with my own thoughts, and started becoming very insecure in my relationship with my boyfriend, whom I currently live with. 

I became very paranoid and almost obsessive about certain things he said to me in the past, etc. I would confront him each time in hopes of obtaining instant relief, which I usually did get. However, this was only temporary. Thankfully I was able to get my job back, but the obsessive thoughts and rumination have not stopped. It’s gotten to a point where my boyfriend said I need to see a therapist, and now I find myself internalizing my emotions more. I feel more irritable, anxious and depressed in general. Today the emotions got so bad I ended up squeezing my arm so hard it left a decent size mark. 

I just feel worn out and sometimes empty inside. I feel like I want to run away from society.",1
"Jobs Wondering what sort of jobs you’ve found have been the most enjoyable and allow you the greatest flexibility around your autism and therefore your needs.

I’m 18, always been told I’m intelligent, but never really felt like I’ve shown anything extremely advanced since I was in pre school/Montessory. 

My main problem is my focus and attention span, which I believe is caused by my undiagnosed ADHD, and is a large part of the reason I think I’d struggle with most university courses, unless it was some thing I was extremely interested in. 

I just don’t know what to do, so thought I’d turn to people like me who have more experience. If it requires Uni, ideally something without insanely high A-Levels, I should be able to get to BCD, maybe BCC, maybe even ACD/C if necessary, but ideally it’s an apprenticeship of some sort.

"Having a tough day. A cashier I work with looked at me and said “Hey, get over here! come over here NOW!” I told her “No, I’m not talking to you if you’re going to give me an attitude. You’re not my boss. I’m nearly 40 years old, not some child you can boss around.” I told my dad and my mom and they both thought I over-reacted. My dad asked me  why I did that. It honestly deeply hurts my feelings that they don’t understand my side of the story and think I’m being rude/immature when I try to stand up for myself. It makes me feel like I’m to blame for things. I’m not perfect, but I have a right to defend myself. Don’t I?

I feel I should just never say anything to anyone anymore at times. I mostly leave with a bad taste in my mouth. I’m the “disrespectful” one. I’m the one who should have “let it go”. Well, I do let things go the majority of the time. I just don’t want people to walk all over me.

"I, a grad student in Biotech, e-mailed 7-8 clinical researchers last week, hoping to impress at least one of them enough to get into a PhD program…one responded with a brief “I’m not accepting students at this time” and the others ignored me 
I don’t understand. I don’t want to give too much away on here and have anyone potentially use my ideas without my corroboration or permission but I had a “lightbulb moment” and my understanding of what shared neural mechanisms I believe are likely at the root of the vast majority of the symptoms of Autism became something I strongly felt warranted further examination in a laboratory setting. 

The idea, of course, didn’t originate entirely with me. But I recognized the broader implications of some relatively recent studies and how they supported the already fairly well-established “connectivity theory” of Autism Spectrum Disorders. They also supported another, less well-established, less well known theory. 

So here I am. Knowing I could make a positive difference in the world. Finally feeling motivated to go to work on an important problem. Being ignored, as always, by the people who (I feel) need to listen. 

Perhaps my idea isn’t as ground-breaking as I believe it is. I don’t know.",1
"My baby-cousin's growth is starting to seriously worry me. Am I overreacting? What do I do if my feelings are confirmed to turn true? From first glance, my NT cousin looks like any other kid. She is social, she plays games etc. However since she was little she always was a little ""shy"": Even with relatives, she refused to talk on the phone. Meeting someone new, she would become nonverbal & hide behind her mother's legs and outside, she would rarely show interest in other people. She also had always been a ""realist"": she always preferred educational shows over fiction shows. Even her pretend-plays were simple stuff like ""playing house"", or ""playing doctor"". Nothing more.

But that's okay. Some kids are a little more shy. Some are more the sciency ""no-nonsens"" types. And at first, those things indeed weren't really problems.

In general:, a lot of the stuff I thought of as ""oddities"", were mostly stuff I realized I projected: The only childhood I knew was my own. I was an incredibly outgoing, curious, book loving and hyperactive child -so seeing any child without a special interest, without bursting energy made me a little worried at first. And every time, I was told that this was okay. This is just how some kids are. And I calmed myself with it...well, until now.

As time goes on here, her ""traits"" are starting to get...concerning. 

From being ""simply realistic"", she is now developing an incredible hatred for anything ""not normal"": In its ""lightest"" form, its just whenever a show comes up with fictional ""non real"" aspects. At best, she gets incredibly confused. I tried to recently show her ""Spirited Away"" and she just got irritated about all the things that ""couldn't exist"". When I tried to jokingly insist that a certain monster existed, she nearly had a screaming fit. 

In its strongest form, she is having fits about people. Being autistic, I have a tend to rock back and forth. I tried to explain it to her numerous times, but she still gets insanely angry at it. One time, she even climbed upon the sofa and tried to physically restrain me. I first thought it was funny, but when I saw her face, I realized how serious she was being in that moment. Other times she gets angry at people not doing sth. the ""correct"" way.

Despite that, she also tends to jump into various extremes. Now tbf, that'd might be another kid thing. However, she again, tends to take it very...far. For example: During a dinner, she suddenly announced that she wasn't going to eat meat anymore, because a animal died for it. Okay. Fair enough. But then she continued: Yelling at us how we're (her mother and me) murderers for eating meat. I remember how baffled I was when she said that, because...I mean...the kid's 8yo. You'd think you hear this type of stuff at age 14yo, but nope. In the end, this also seemed to be just a short phase, as at the end of the dinner, she quickly re-changed her mind and ate the last meat. Which -again, is a kids thing. But the way she jumped to such an extreme end to directly call us ""murderers"" was very odd (and -no. This is not to start a debate about that topic).

I'm not going to lie, it seems probably ridiculous what I'm feeling rn. But the more time I'm trying to spend with her...the more I'm starting to feel afraid. Like. I don't want to call her anything. I want to firmly believe/hope that she is just a cranky child. She will grow up. She will understand. But...

Listen. I'll be blunt. I know how cruel children can be. I've seen it with my own two eyes. This special mix of not-knowing, but also ""insisting"" is how a lot of bullying can start as early as Kindergarten. They grow, not realizing that their worldview is subjective. That their words hurt someone. Especially NT children are the biggest harm to ND children a lot.

I know it's probably just my CPTSD to a degree. But I slowly find myself harder and harder to love her. The more red flags I see about her behaviour, the more I fear what type of human she might become. What if she's already hurting other children? What if she's already hurting another ND child, like I was? What if she grows up to hate me and see me as ""deranged""? What if she will escalate into an extreme field?

Right now, she has no idea that I'm thinking this. I happily pretend everything is fine. I never yell at her, or call her anything. But I generally don't know how to deal with this situation.",1

"Has anyone else turned asocial? I have spent a huge amount of my life catering to others but I have developed myself alone.

I planned eventually to leave my hermit life at some point and go back to interacting with other people. My mental health has gotten way better, I have learned very important things when it comes to socializing and I have been overall preparing to interact and connect with people even to the same levels that neurotypicals are capable of. 

I just happened to meet other autistic people and people on campus have been more friendly to me. But I'm not socializing with them, I do not interact with them because I don't want to.

I'm not even coping at this point. I have the opportunity and the resources to have a social life. Actually, the healthiest social life that I could have asked for, since now I'm more self aware, I can spot toxic people easily and set boundaries. Yet I have zero drive to do so.

What do I do now? I have no idea.

I see people here suffering from social anxiety and the autistic guys I met wishing to make a minecraft server with me. I also see neurotypicals that want me to interact with them and maybe tell them what have I done last weekend or go for a drink. I used to have strong desire to meet new people and have genuine friendships. Now I feel like people bring nothing to me. Not in a depressing way or through hate.

You see, I'm also asexual and aromantic and I know what it is not to be attracted to people in certain ways. I enjoy spending time with people but I don't feel like there is something inside me that is pulling me to actually want to spend time with them. I can tell that I used to feel this way years ago because I wanted new friends but now it feels like there is no social desire and I have only realized this by integrating again with society for the first time since 2019.

Have I reached nirvana or some other shit?

Am I the only one that has gone through this, or there is maybe more of you? Anyways, if anyone is interested in the specific things that you have to do to remove your desire to be with people AMA or I'll try to make a tutorial idk.",1

"My partner's implicit communication feels like gaslighting My husband (NT, N47) of 20 years and I (ND, F44) are going through a difficult time and I have noticed that so much of our tough conversations feel like gaslighting. When I looked at it closely and from every angle ;) it seems like this is the pattern:

\-He tells me something about himself, ""I've always been this way, it's who I am.""

\-At a later time, I bring it up, ""What can I do if you say that's just who you are and you can't or won't change?""

\-To which he respond, ""That's not what I said,,..."", and proceeds to say something much different.

He's an honest, compassionate guy, and for the longest time I could not figure out why he was changing his story so much; it felt like gaslighting, and make him seem really shady, which he isn't. Then it occurred to me that I think what is happening is I was listening to and believing his actual words, but when I said them back to him, the literal meaning wasn't what he meant, but some nuanced unspoken intention I didn't pick up on...maybe? Honestly, as I'm typing this I can't even really make sense of it because it is so bizarre to me that he assumes the first time he said it, that I would know the secret, invisible REAL meaning behind his words? I'm not implying any malice on his part, or intention, but it has been endlessly frustrating!! And of course because I am hyper-self aware and self-examining, I end up being the one to recognize what is happening, doing the work to bridge the communication, and try to find a way to make sense of all this.

Is is still gaslighting if he doesn't know it's happening and when to him, his story didn't change, just his delivery?

"Co-workers I’m hoping for some ideas. I’ve been working at the same place for almost 5 years. I was diagnosed as an adult, several years ago. I do not have any other diagnoses, but my former psychiatrist suggested c-ptsd and I take sleeping medication for insomnia. No one in my office knows I have ASD and in this country it is not understood, so I don’t tell others. However I am NT passing (at the cost of much stress).

This last year two new coworkers were hired. One I sanctioned as a part of the hiring process, the other I didn’t meet until the first day. It is a small office (4 people including me) and was a very intimate team in the past. I liked my previous co-worker and my manager. I am not close outside of work and have my own friends (some ND folks mostly). 

It has been a really hard year. One co-worker was mean from the get-go. She ignored me, greeted others without greeting me, intentionally excluded me from group conversation, talked over me, interrupted me to monopolize whoever I was talking to. No one knows why. Meanwhile, she deeply befriended the other co-worker, who I have to work closely with. This co-worker accused me of using a “tone” and talking down to her in training. From then on all year she has ignored any comments that are positive towards me, and talks mostly about her own accomplishments in meetings together, excluding any part I took in it. She also says she doesn’t understand me like all the time. I think on purpose? These people are older in their mid-late thirties and we are teachers at a small private school. They spend any time my manager isn’t in the room planning going out dancing or clubbing together (think 3 people working, 2 planning their weekend together, in a tiny room). They also talk about upsetting topics (anti-trans, anti-lgbt, wrong information stated confidently) 

The worst part is my manager, who used to be more friendly, hasn’t done anything and chats happily with them despite telling me she sees what’s happening. She tells me I’m “being too nice”?!?! And apparently avoiding conflict as much as possible was the wrong way?! I don’t like conflict and I just want to work peacefully.

Is this common? I haven’t dealt with this kinda stuff since middle school. How can I not be too nice but also stay professional. I’m changing jobs for unrelated reasons and I’m scared of it happening again.

Of course this is all my perspective. I cannot see if I’ve been an asshole to them unconsciously, but at least according to my manager I’ve been nice?",1

Even with the very RARE occasion that someone seemed genuine about being my friend but I was obviously very bad on reciprocating back. Fuck, it's just lately it's been bothering me that I had no REAL friends growing up. Sure I was cool with some people and classmates were generally nice to me but it was all mega surface level bullshit. I'm talking REAL FRIENDS.

Not just you'll only hang out if I initiate, I rarely hear from you if I don't say anything and pretty much the only way I'll ever see you is in the forced environment where I met you in.

"Mirroring someone's verbal stims Hello there,

I've been wondering about what it feels like if someone repeats your particular verbal stims as a way of connecting (?) with you, if I may say so. The context for my question is this:

I work with a young autistic person (early twenties) and they use many verbal stims. At first they'd ask me for information (collecting facts about an expression, making sense of the expression they've observed somewhere), then I noticed that the phrases were usually coming up at the end of the session as a ritual. I'd announce that I'm leaving for the day and we'd go through this routine of a physical goodbye (handshake and a hug), and then this happens: we look each other in the eyes and repeat the few phrases in question (they're out of context if we're thinking about saying goodbye) at the same time, sort of as a ritual. I have asked the individual about their own feelings regarding this and they say it feels ""good"". To me, it feels like ""I'm here, I'm engaging with you in this shared ritual"". In no way do I intend to be insensitive, but I don't always realize I'm being rude, so I'd like to ask about your experience - has this ever happened to you? What does it feel like?

The ritual repetition kind of feels like a closure, it grounds me and gives me a sense of stability. The meaning of the words does not matter, what matters is the sound of both of our voices, the sense of togetherness and shared experience. It feels like ""thank you, see you next time"". I should note that I myself identify as autistic. I have not heard a more detailed description from the individual I work with,  other than ""good"", but they always smile when engaging in this ritual.

&#x200B;

Edit: I guess the reason for my question is that I worry they may be conditioned into compliance (thus saying it feels good), but on the other hand, they're the ones initiating this ritual, I never initiate it as to not pressure them into it. Thanks! Really hoping for some input.",1

Anyway, fast forward to today. I work at Sam's Club; alot of the times, I would see those I went to school with. Well today, I saw a group of people I knew from middle school. Ngl, it made me feel some kind of way. I felt bad that alot of people I went to school with is still in contact with one another, hanging out with each other; meanwhile, I'm just existing, not hanging out with those I once knew.

At my age, I feel like I'm missing out on life; whether it be socializing, romance, living my life, going out somewhere, the whole 9. Today was just another example of that. While I have socialized and hung out with a few friends before, it wasn't consistent. Besides, it's been a long time since then.

I wish I had a social group where I feel like I can contribute and feel like I belong; to be a part of something genuine as opposed to being just there. Whether it be a co-worker, a new group of friends, or if there's still time, those that I knew from middle school or high school.

I always felt like I missed out on my youth; today was just another reminder of what I have missed.

Pardon me if this comes off as too complainy, whiny, or too thirsty, I'm just venting right now. There might be come contradictions in this post; feel free to point them out.

Thank you for reading.

As a person with the condition I've always said that I don't know how to do something just cos I did it before. Will do a task but when I must to do it again  I sometomes say don't know how to do it and people will say I've done it before so I know how to do it. But I just have no clue what I'm supposed to do.  Just because I've done something before doesn't mean I know how to do it again and then I'm so afraid to do anything because I i may not know how to do it again. My brain is different to mainstream people trying to make me be just like them they think it's something like controlling thing like I know how to do everything but I'm just trying to make them do it because I'm lazy and that's really not true.,1

I like that we’re both coming into this without many pre-conceived notions about each other, but i am starting to worry about it regardless. I can be awkward around new people, and i’m worried that conversation might taper off/i stumble over my words/etc. i don’t know why i’m so concerned with making a good first impression with someone that i don’t even know, but i am lol, thanks for reading through this 🤝",1
might lose my job in the next week or so Hello friends fellow aspie here. I have been working in IT industry for the last 4.3 years. Recently I switched companies due to some issues at work. I am not able to understand the code base of the new company. I might lose this job in the next week or so . Just preparing myself to handle the situation when it happens.,1
"Impostor syndrome Even though I have been diagnosed twice with aspergers (at 6 and 13 years old), I sometimes feel like I don’t belong to this community. This feeling comes from seeing other people struggle with things I don’t struggle with myself. I personally don’t have much sensory issues, or at least that’s what I thought. I recently saw a [video](https://youtu.be/8ZZ5FSfFVog), and after watching this I learned that I actually do have sensory issues, mainly with sound. I just didn’t have anything to compare it to before, so I thought that this was how it is like for everyone. Who knows with how many more things this might be the case. I’m only 17 and still figuring things out about myself, but sometimes I just feel like an impostor when a fellow aspie has a problem I can’t relate to. I’m fully aware that not everyone on the spectrum deals with the same issues, but even knowing this it doesn’t make it any better for me.",1
"I'm so tired of not being able to do things I want to preface this by stating I work a job that has me in office for 9 hours a day 4 days out of the week and then 6 hours on the 5th day. There is no modifying this and the pay is extremely good (I do have an end date to this job but until then, this is my situation). Anyways, yesterday was tiring. I got a flat after work and it took 2 hours to fix it and get home (long story). Anyways that threw my whole schedule off and I knew that I would need to be gentle with myself today.  


Well at work I was. I made sure to take things easy on myself, laugh with my coworkers, and just overall have a good work day. And the work day was great (Other than a brief stint of getting lost picking up the catering but after that it was back to being great). I got home, gave a lot of attention to my cat and my sister asked if I wanted to play a game. I said sure, give me half an hour because I wanted to do a few chores.  


I should have known better because as I'm doing the chores I feel my anxiety rising because I realized I'm hungry and I don't have much time left before it is game time (I have massive time anxiety). But I want to finish the chores so I keep at it. But my cat keeps bothering me and suddenly people start texting me and I can feel it coming but I ignore it because its been so long since I had a full fledged meltdown and I thought I could stave it off.

Wrong. 

I finish the chore and go in the kitchen to maybe make myself food. I can't. The meltdown is starting. I feel it. And I cannot stop it. Everything is suddenly overwhelming. I have to tell my sister I can't play with her and her friends (And I do tell her why, she is understanding) and then all of my energy for anything else is gone and the meltdown comes in full force. And I'm left sobbing on the floor, ashamed that I can't just be fucking normal. That yesterday is still affecting my today so badly and that I can't do a simple set of chores and play a simple game and make myself some food.

I am making very simple food now (frozen pizza) but my head hurts so much (Unfortunately my meltdowns do consist of hitting my head or punching a wall. I absolutely hate it and I can't seem to control it). I'm suddenly so exhausted and sad and angry. Why do I have to be like this? I hate this. Hate. Hate. Hate.",1
"Self expression as a means to communication  

I've been struggling to figure out how to make new friends. While I recognize that small talk is necessary, it often feels like a chore to me, and I've tried many things suggested in books without much success. I think part of the problem is that small talk doesn't feel genuine to me, and I much prefer talking about things that matter to me, like personal development, philosophy, and learning about the life of the person I'm talking to. When it comes to my hobbies, like playing the piano, I can talk about them, but I often feel like I can't elaborate or express myself fully.

Recently, I had a conversation with a friend who suggested that I could share my hobbies in a more expressive way, such as playing a piano piece on my phone. This got me thinking about how self-expression could make small talk more engaging and less of a chore.

I'm curious to hear from others on the spectrum who can relate to my struggles and how you learned to be more expressive in social situations.",1
"Burnout I went shopping yesterday and I really enjoyed it. But later that night I started becoming really anxious (almost to the point of having a panic attack which I haven’t had in months) and I still am today. My PRN meds aren’t helping at all.

"I meet the outdated Asperger's criteria in the DSM-4. What happens next? I had my very long five-hour examination today. When he spoke to my mother, he focused a lot on asking about my childhood development and seemed surprised I walked and talked earlier than my sister. I was always the smart, intellectual kid who knew many different things about certain subjects. However, the Autism criteria in the DSM-5 specifically mention that symptoms must be present in the early developmental period. Well, as I said, I did everything very early and mainly only had very fixated interests and routines and spoke only about the same things I enjoyed. I'm concerned he's going to hyperfocus on my early development and mark me off as not autistic since Aspergers isn't a diagnosis in the U.S. anymore. Sigh! I never even mentioned Aspergers since I know it's been merged with autism, but it has me wishing I did.

He also asked if I had agoraphobia when I mentioned shutting down in public and avoiding places that make me anxious. I don't have social anxiety, but I know what upsets me. I made sure to make an effort to let him know I have friends I enjoy spending time with (honestly, I can't just sit around and not leave the house all day), but I have a social battery.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Thank you in advance.

"I told my boyfriend I am autistic. I am not good at communicating in general, so I wrote him a front and back note. It went into detail about how I don’t like to be touched very often and about certain behaviors and stims I have. He seemed to be pretty understanding and texted me later(after school)after I gave it to him. He apologized for being so touchy and I told him just to ask. But he’s texting one of my best friends about it whom he used to have a crush on. She knows we’re dating and helped us get together but he’s ALWAYS telling her about our relationship and stuff like that. And I don’t know exactly what they’re talking about.

I feel like I’m just overthinking about this whole thing and I shouldn’t have told my bf.",1

"Using fashion to camouflage myself into society? Hello beautiful people out there🙌

So im a girl in my early twenties, and i noticed i have this weird tendency. At first I thought I was simply a shopaholic. Which i found weird but it's not far from the truth. After some ""self digging"" i concluded my self-esteem could be better. And at last i had a conversation with a psychologist who asks me ""what would happen if you gained weight? Why would it be bad?"" To which i got teary and told her ""i guess i wont fit into my clothes anymore"". 

All of which sounds very vain, which i am aware of. But im starting to realize after that talk that I use fashion/clothes to mask my insecurities (like most probably) and mainly mask the fact that i always feel like i stand out... It's difficult saying exactly why but i tend to feel out of place at most gatherings. So before events...new things...new meetings with people(or just one) i plan ahead. I plan funny stories that will make me seem likable...i plan what to eat in the given situation...i do a mini google research on how those i will meet look like...and lastly i pick the perfect outfit, with matching nail polish and accessories. 

Like everything will be fine if they(the strangers)  just gave me a fair chance. And I feel the need to ""trick them"" into thinking im ""one of them"" and maybe after they speak to me they will realise that im both humoristic, reliable and trustworthy.

 Like... writing this makes me seem both privileged... obnoxious...and just overall weird. But i cant be the only autistic person, who goes against the stereotypical comfortable dressed person and actively chooses impractical outfits simply to get a slight chance of fitting in at first glance. 

Hope to hear from someone in here. Have a nice day everyone 🌸

(Fun fact: Online shopping might be a bit of  a special interest. It would be so funny to write someone who relates to me. I can be shown an article of clothing on a model on a picture and tell my friends from which shop the model models. Or which brand shoes a or dress if from without seeing the brand symbol/name based on small characteristics between different brands. We are not talking luxury brands but just ""normal brands"". I will shop at a thrift shop with my hands and select the good quality fabrics and check lables to be reassured of my initial thought.)",1
"I'm tired of people. My dad discussed with me about the fact that I did stay the last week basically inside my bedroom. I'm a female, and I'm on my 20's. I'm still in college and I have a job where I talk to people almost daily.

This week was a holiday in my country and everyone did go out to celebrate, but I decided to stay at home. I was on my period and I spent all this time with my fiance on facetime, doing stuff together. My house is kinda big, and I like small spaces, so I feel uncomfortable outride my room. My dad says that I'm depressed because I isolate myself, but honestly I'm depressed because of people.

I'm tired of having to deal with people around me that are about my age, but aren't interested in almost anything that I am, or how shallow they want their relationships to be. There's no real connection anymore, and I am fucking tired. Every guy I talk don't want friendship, want always something more and they throw shots at me even knowing I'm not available. 

Today a guy that works on my building and it's on his 50's or did put his arm around me and he did put his hand on my waist, and it was really uncomfortable to get out of the situation. I don't have any friends, and honestly i can't find the energy to go and meet people. I don't think I want friends right now. It feels just so superficial, all the time. My dad and my step mom always have something negative to comment about me. About me being too isolated. 

I just want to lock myself away, with my fiancee and a bunch of animals. I miss quarantine. Not the stress of COVID, but being able to focus more on my stuff and not wasting energy and time going on a bus full of people to go to a work that I can't stand it anymore, but I can't quit currently, and interacting with shallow people.",1

"Too often, the comorbities are the main focus rather than the autism itself I think people often try to come up with unnecessarily complex reasons why we do the things we do and it’s kinda strange. Like, everything is supposed to be a sign that I’m on the nth layer of unconscious anxiety. It’s a really stressful way to analyze behavior. 

Anyway, I say this because I think professionals often try to treat the anxiety rather than the autism and it simply isn’t as effective. Years ago, I was really upset about being rejected by a group. I thought about it a lot. Sure, calming anxiety and reframing things and whatnot helps temporarily. What helped permanently, though, is asking a social science forum why groups typically choose to reject members. I got some good answers that made sense in relation to my experience, and voila, the rumination was gone the next morning. I didn’t need to be told to get over it or to calm down, I simply needed basic social norms to be explained to me.

Weird, right? I feel dumb even saying it. But it’s the truth. Treating the autism (explaining social norms) was ultimately more helpful than treating rumination or anxiety ever would have been. 

I understand that we really don’t have good autism treatments out there for adults yet, but I would love for that to become a thing rather than just treating the effects of being in a world where you don’t understand the sociocultural norms. If we could treat that and understand them, I think a lot of comorbid issues would go away overnight, much like one of mine did years ago.

Sorry that this may seem a little scatterbrained, as this isn’t as topic that is much discussed, so there’s not a great way to write about it yet.",1

"Questions for People with High-Functioning Autism or Asperger's Hello everyone. I hope you are doing well. I just got diagnosed with high-functioning Autism or Asperger's, though I know the latter term is now outdated. It actually explains a lot about my behaviour and why I felt so different from others.

I have some quick questions for y'all just to get an idea of how many people with ASD actually share some traits of mine that I very rarely come across so I could get an idea whether it's just a small minority within ASD or if it's common among people in the community. 

As an individual with high-functioning Autism, 

1) do you like analyzing everything that neurotypical individuals don't and use logic everywhere and try to be as close to perfectly rational as humanly possible, or consider yourself more resistant to irrationality than the average neurotypical individual and are bothered by how illogical and irrational people are at times?, 

2) are you highly motivated, driven and passionate about one or more topics and inclined to enjoy setting and working on ambitious goals?, and

3) Anyone here who is NOT gifted, or at least doesn't consider themselves gifted in mathematics and programming, or isn't confident in their abilities in these domains? This may be a stereotype but I'm not sure; at least I don't consider myself gifted in those subjects, though I am above average in a few other topics.

Also were you prescribed medications when you were first diagnosed?

Here in the UK all they can say is I have autism. They can't say what kind because it's discrimination but I suspect it's aspergers. In the past I have struggled with work as I always reach a point I get too overwhelmed with everyday life and always end up taking too much time off which has led to disciplinary and even been laid off. During this time I've also suffered with mental health problems on and off. 

Now I don't work. I haven't done for 3/4 years. I claim UK sick benefits and this pays enough for me to get by. I'm actually really happy just sat in by myself away from people. I feel at peace.

"Overstimulation - How does it affect you? Question is in the title - I’m trying to work out if my experience is overstimulation or just plain old anxiety.

An example for me is leaving the house in the day. My heartrate shoots up, I get hot and sweat, I walk really quickly (like a motor is driving me), my vision blurs/eyes glaze, my hearing reduces, I become hyperfixated on how I look e.g. where my eye gaze is, my facial expressions etc. It feels like everyone is watching me. I feel disassociated like I am floating and in a game. Super sensitive to loud noises I didn’t anticipate. I’m super conscious of what I wear, presumably to blend in and I am even more reluctant to leave the house if I don’t look my best.

I presume the road noise, the light from the sun, the heat, being seen by others/the chance of bumping into somebody I know etc. is actually what is making me feel like the above, but I’m not sure.

To contrast, I enjoy walking at night when it is quiet, cool and dark and actually as close to relaxing as I’ve got.

"Feelings of stress/tension Hello, I work in a career field that causes me a lot of stress/tension and possible anxiety. I have to interact with people all day long. On bad days I feel a lot of tension in my chest and just a general feeling of stress. I liken it to feeling “pent up”.

I like to workout and do BJJ. I workout prior to work and then do BJJ in the evening. My mornings workout kind of prepares me for work and sets my mood and BJJ helps me wind down after work. 

My issue is I only get that stress/tension release from drilling and rolling at the end of BJJ class. However, often times I don’t get to roll because I’m not assertive or good at approaching people and initiating the process of rolling.  Due to this I often times am left on the sidelines observing and then leaving class more pent up than when I got there. I don’t know why I feel so pent up and why I can’t just approach people. I suppose this is more of a vent because the obvious answer is I need to just buck up and approach people but it’s hard for me.",1

"I did something dumb, even doubt my autism because of it I went in an exchange in another capital with my class , and we were staying in a hostel with the whole class. Now I met someone online who also lived in that capital and we started to date during my exchange time, only I dumped my class for it 3 times ( not participating in group activities) and I’ve damaged the teachers trust badly because of it, which is understandable ( being terribly late, or going while I would actually have dinner in a restaurant with my class, skipping them). I know autistic people have no hard time complying to rules, which I agree with, except when it comes to “love”, I’m seriously able to not mind ruining things for myself. I just do not understand why I just damaged everyone’s trust( I understand why but not WHY I did it, I feel so bad afterwards), I’m thinking it might have to do with narcissism. Thoughts?

Edit: I added why I do not understand why I did it. I cancelled planned dinner with my class and  arrived extremely late (4 hours), while we were supposed to function as a group ( which I hate) I damaged the teachers trust, mind you I’m 22 and childish as hell.

"Need advice on a couple of questions about dating and dating apps… 1. For those of you dating or in a relationship, when did you know it was the right time to start looking or being involved in one? I’m torn because I desire companionship and I haven’t had a “real” relationship since middle school (long story, potentially triggering so I don’t think I should go into details), so part of me feels like it’s time to get over it and move on. The other part of me isn’t sure I can handle friendship or dating right now with school coming up again soon, and just that I get drained even from simple online conversations.
2. What’s your opinion/experience with dating apps? I’m on Hiki right now (for those who don’t know, it’s a dating app specifically for Aspies), and A) I’m not attracted to or not compatible with a lot of the people on there, and B) the ones that I am attracted to or compatible with either live 500+ miles away, and/or are 10-20 years older than I am.",1

"Had a horrible conversation with a psychologist This is a follow-up to another post I made on here. Basically, I (16m) was diagnosed with autism, but I’m not sure if the diagnosis was accurate. I felt really bad because I felt like it was being pushed on me and based on a lot of wrong information that was slewed by my mom’s reporting of events.

I talked to the psychologist who diagnosed me to try to figure things out. The conversation was horrible. I went in thinking that I wasn’t going to be argumentative, and I wanted to be open to learning from her and getting a better understanding of the situation, but she actually was the one who was extremely argumentative. She didn’t have anything positive to say about me, and she was very condescending the whole time (for example, asking questions like “oh you’re like this, do you realize that?” and always acting like she’s 100% correct about everything).

One of the main reasons she gave was that I “couldn’t have reciprocal conversations”, which is completely wrong. Her evidence was that during the assessment, I didn’t ask her questions, but that was just because I assumed it was an interview format. I always ask my friends how they’re doing, and I’ve had people in my class specifically complement me for how good and easy I was to talk to.

I’m still figuring everything out (although I wish I was given more room to), and I don’t want to let one shitty person affect my opinions, but it is hard not to associate the diagnosis with her.",1

"Is this what a parent is supposed to do? I was thinking about some things as I am making notes to bring up in therapy next week. I was wondering if your parent or step parent did this or if they are supposed to do this. So I am almost 26 now and have my own insurance now but when I was about 18-19 my step dad would constantly talk about how much I would cost them any time a medical bill came in the mail. He would always show it to me and tell me how much I cost them. He would even come to the place I worked at the time and show it to me while picking up a drink he would order all the time(I used to work at McDonald’s). I was told that this was for my own good and to teach me how much it cost to go to the doctor but it has only caused me to fear going to the doctor among other things. For fear of wasting their time. I feel like an annoyance even if I have a legit reason to go. Hearing “look at how much you cost me” over and over didn’t feel like it was good parenting but I’m not a parent so I don’t know for sure. There is also the fact that any time something goes wrong with my car or something(I’m not fully independent yet as I haven’t graduated college and do not own the car I am driving)I freak the hell out. My parents don’t seem to understand why but like, my step dad used to scream at me for every little fuck up I had, or he would “give me a REAL reason to cry”. I pay for stuff for the car but I still panic every time. Is this supposed to happen? Has anyone else experienced behavior like this from a parent?",1

NTs could literally do anything and get credit for it, yet I do exactly the same thing and have to complete it on my own because “I’m a capable adult”. Yet somehow everyone else doesn’t get this treatment.

I also hate the fact that at work, people just assume I’m some kind of super computer or intelligent just because I’m autistic. It’s so damn tiring.

Even if it is the simplest of tasks, or a work task. “Sorry I’m busy” etc. Yet when they need help and I don’t provide it, people are first to accuse me of being in the wrong or being ungrateful and lazy. I’m not being lazy, I’m literally just doing what everyone else does. Yet when I do it, you pick up on it. When somebody else does, they’re off the hook.

It’s such a double standard.

I’ve also noticed that in general, NTs are so impressionable on other NTs. To the point where you are almost living life on easy mode.

"Anyone else have or had helicopter parents? I feel like along with aspergers, this was another thing that set me up for a difficult adult life.

I guess she didn't want that to happen to me but she doesn't understand that her being overprotective was equally as bad. In some ways even worse. Being raised this way really fucks up your adulthood. I'm still trying to shake off any dependency I have with anyone cause that's how I was when I was younger and it's something I still struggle with in my late 20s. I also feel so immature in behind with most people my age. Hell I even know people way younger than are more mature and put together than me. I get I have to accept my share of responsibility in this, but people also gotta understand this is all I knew growing up so its extremely difficult to just shake off.

"Dating an Aspie with avoidant attachment I started dating an Aspie May 2022. I love him very much and I think he loves me though he hasn’t said but we’re not together anymore. He’s undiagnosed though he recognizes that he is has Asperger’s. I’ve learned about Asperger’s through my own research not through him being self aware and sharing with me. He broke up with me after 4 months of being together the day before traveling the world together. We’re both travelers. We are no contact for the most part but about every 2 months one of us breaks it. His pattern is asking to be friends, then agreeing to go to therapy together, then saying he has no feelings for me anymore, asking to me friends again, and when I try to work with him it’s always an excuse that leads us to being no contact again. Yesterday he emailed me saying that we can’t be friends because we both know it would lead to more. He expressed that he thrives in isolation and wasn’t made for social interaction and that he has hurt me by involving himself. He’s also expressed that im kind and fun and he feels safe when he’s with me and he doesn’t have that in his life. 

I think I understand what’s happening but do aspies truly thrive in isolation? I thought this was just a response to intense childhood trauma. And the fact that he has mentioned he’s very lonely tells me that he is not thriving in isolation if he is craving connection? 

Any insight would be helpful. We’re back to no contact. This sucks because I love him so much and I’m willing to work on things but he seems to think this is his default and there is nothing to be done. I don’t want to invalidate what he is telling me either. I don’t know if it’s all true or if he is just scared and unwilling to work on himself and on our communication. 

I’m gentle with him and I know I’d be a great partner to him. But I obviously cannot force someone to want to be with me.",1

For me it was metal, with my greasy long hair and band t-shirts, I allowed myself to be however I liked. In the metal community, degeneracy, autism and weirdness is actually encouraged. When I was a metalhead, I actually faked being extra autistic because then my true autism would get a pass.
And when people asked me ""why are you being so weird?"", I answered them ""because I'm a metalhead, we're supposed to be like that"".
And whatever I did that was weird or autistic I channeled it out on being a metalhead.
It shielded me from all shame of being an autistic, but I was basically treated like a dog.

We were still close despite this because our social difficulties. Eventually I told him and cut him off leaving him ghosted pretty much. Later he reached out to me and I accepted because at this time I was no longer a people pleaser or door mat. I became cold angry and bitter. We had an argument over an online video games because I to begin with was irritable from having a bad day from work and didnt want to play. Then he says he never wants to play again with me and becomes extremelt judgmental and critical as he always gets. Then i try to defend myself and he keeps throwing all these labels like narcassist, and im child like etc and i told him of my aspergers and my struggle with stress and depression and he pretty much told me  I was full of crap. I admitted I have to work on aspects he brang up, and said hes right but then he says holy shit youre a narcassist. It feels like Im trapped and cant even defend myself.

"I never realized how different people's lives are socially Recently a friend of mine was fired on the spot from his general manager for breaking a $30 piece of equipment. Totally insane I might add. Next day, all of his coworkers and other managers boycotted the whole day to bring him back. Not only did they succeed on rehiring him but everyone pitched in to pay for the equipment he broke AND they increased his pay. One of the managers even cried that he was gone. Obviously I'm happy for my friend because he deserved it and honestly not even jealous about it but I was shocked to hear how lovely people treat their other coworkers on the job.

When I quit from my job, I learned that my manager purposely gave me crappy hours so I would quit and that my friend that got me the job knew about this but didn't tell me. He didn't bother to maybe tell the manager to not do that or at the very least tell me to look for another job. And with the way my coworkers talk with each other, I doubt my friend was the only one who knew about this. So no one stuck up for me and which is really disheartening because I knew some of them from high school and the rest were around my age so we got along really well. Even when I quit no one even asked where I went or that they'll miss me. Not a word from anybody.

And the third is the natural language AI chatGPT, which If you combined the three, could have a system that listened to 

1.	    What people were saying. 
2.	Captions it in real time. 
3.	and feeds it into chatGPT that could then give you three options to reply with subtext and sarcasm detection.

"Ruminating on past mistakes? I have an issue where I ruminate and fixate on past mistakes and it makes me upset and kind of depressed. It’s not even really social mistakes.

For example, I remember in 3rd grade myself and a classmate told the teacher we wanted to study over recess and she let us and we stole imaginary money (paper slips) to use later on in class auctions. 

Another example I had a girlfriend in high school and she was a really bad person (I wasn’t a good person either back then either) and I stayed with her for way to long because I was afraid to be alone because I didn’t have friends. Her family hated me and they beat the crap out of me one time and were going to shoot me.

"am i on the spectrum? Ever since i was a child, I have had troubles interacting and playing with anyone and my middle-school classmates always thought that i was weird or ”different” and i never quite understood the reason why. Thats why i was always a target for bullies. I had a few friends whom i sometimes hung out with in kindergarten and middle-school, but i mostly enjoyed my own company, playing videogames. I have always been emotionally and sensorially sensitive thus i get easily frustrated and want to be by myself. I don’t think that i’ve ever had difficulties learning in school but i have had very low attendance rate my whole school career, and i think the reason to that was the fact that being in a classroom full of people made me overstimulated. In highschool i was like everyone else (at least to the public eye) and didn’t even know who i was. (Looking back, i can’t even recognize myself). Now I’ve been observing myself for a few years and i’ve noticed that i get overwhelmed really easily, i have sensitivities to certain textures and i really need my alone time not talking to anyone. I get burdened waaayy too easily (compared to anyone else). Thats when i need to be alone in a complete silence. The only person who i can be 100% myself with, is me. I have noticed that i always had different fixations, noise sensitivity,  poor eye contact and abnormal postures ever since i was in kindergarten. I dissociate whenever i am in a mall or any other buzzing environment full of people, sounds, smells and lights. Once i accidentally bruised my whole arm on accident when dissociating. I acknowledge that it doesn’t necessarily mean that i am on the spectrum and it can be related to something else.  I don’t know if this matters, but my older brother has been diagnosed with mild aspergers when he was little.",1
"The poker chip shuffle is my ultimate stimming tool God I can do that shit for HOURS. It is so satisfying, the way it sounds, the way the chips click together, the way it feels between your fingers, the way it can be so incredibly smooth if you get it just right.

I'm not an avid poker player, it's very on-and-off, but god damn [shuffling poker chips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyuFV7y_W08) is like my ultimate fidgeting/stimming tool. It's the perfect lightning rod for my mind.",1
"How do you all deal with disruption to your routine? I am on the way to work (I live in London) and one of the London Underground lines is suspended. I have to take a much longer route to work and I will still be late.

Anyone else need blackout curtains for your bedroom? I love having them. I absolutely can not tolerate the sun in the morning or any sort of light. For me to sleep it has to be pitch black in my room. Anyone else got them?,1
"How do you deal with the “friend zone”? I honestly hate using the term but it’s what applies in my situation. I’m really good friends with a girl but I have a bit of a crush on her. She has a boyfriend, but she does know my feelings and is fine with it. I accept that the relationship may not advance farther than friends, and I’m fine with it. I don’t want to interfere with their happiness. I just feel kinda bad because I don’t know if I’ll find someone like her. It sucks and I’m just trying to figure out how to cope with it because I like being friends with her.",1
"The Happy Ending Hollywood Movie Does it feel like with Asperger’s, everyone else has a Hollywood type esque life, meeting their spouse in their 20s and 30s, nailing that dream career and you’re thinking what the hell is wrong with you, missing all these ‘normal’ milestones",1
"Dealing with the jealousy of not being as functional as other people? VENT+advice please I’m 16F. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s and depression. I’ve been in therapy for long, but I feel like I have something standing in my way of progressing. I am very low functioning when it comes to social stuff, I miss out on a lot of social cues, I’m socially awkward, I actually have no irl friends who I have stable contact with, and just 2 online friends. 

I desperately want to become more socially available, because I’m lonely. 

But before I make any progress on improving that, I have a horrible problem with jealousy. I’m constantly spiteful of how I think it’s unfair I’m so bad at socializing. 

Every time I see someone having fun, I feel extremely jealous and often angry. 

When people around me say stuff like “I have social anxiety, and it makes me awkward” and then I see them have friends and connections, I feel angry, because I compare myself to them and think they don’t know the true struggle of being “actually awkward”. 

Same goes to my autistic friends from group therapy, I always thought my asperger’s can play a big part of why changing my habits is so hard, but then I see them having friends almost effortlessly, and it makes me even more jealous. 

I don’t understand why me specifically. I know it’s wrong to think of them this way, because they experience stuff in their own way and it’s not their fault, and our experiences cannot be compared. 

But I still feel the way I do. What makes it especially hard is that I feel very hopeless about improving my skills and I don’t even know what exactly I’m doing wrong. 

I just want to know how to healthily cope and understand my emotions. If you have similar experiences, please share!",1
"Do you have difficulty planning for the future? I'm trying to apply for jobs, because I hate my current one, but I just find it all so overwhelming, like, I can't deal with the idea of changing anything on a permanent basis. I've been doing a dead-end job I hate for three years basically just because I can't cope with making decisions about what I want to do next. Does anyone else get this? How do you deal with it?",1
"A new government forms in your country, they say they want to improve society for people with Asperger's. They take a poll to see the most popular ideas and they will 100% implement the 5 ideas people with Asperger's want the most, no matter how crazy. What would be your top five suggestions? It can range from specific and practical things like schooling methods, labour laws, rules about city design, rules about the layouts of shops, certain rules in traffic/public transport etc., to more abstract/general things like a desire for society that has ""social schooling"" or more social flexibility, a society that is more focused on logic/efficiency than emotions/traditions, a society that is not based on money, things like that.",1

"I can't stand the whole ""become an extrovert/don't be yourself"" trend. They don't say those words exactly but they imply it and I see either all over places like Tik Tok/Twitter/Reddit. You'd think with the rise of social media, people would be embracing being introverts but nope. People like everything else, use it to embrace their egos. Feel like if anything, the stigma about introverts has gotten worse. For our generation (Millenials and Gen Z) to be talking about boomers, we sure do double down on some boomer views sometimes. This especially affects us with aspergers since the majority of us are introverts. Just something I thought was annoying and idk if anyone else here noticed it too.",1
"Is an aspie thing? Always follow my strict social and moral rules but I’m sick of people abusing my code. I break sometimes and feel (very) bad after I don’t know if everybody here have some kind of very strict moral and social code to follow but as long as can remember of my existence I always try to be nice and follow this set of rules, mostly based on common sense (or my vision of).

Is a error that I keep repeating (is a signal of madness btw), to trust people and expect they to act as you do. Never happen. The NTs are more flexible in their morals?

What I can see is that normal people always bend the rule and they really use my moral compass to abuse my will.

And usually their behavior is masked by a nice moralist shit talk and lessons about the life and universe.

Is so fucking annoying this hypocrisy and I note everywhere, specially on workplace. Usually the Paladin of virtues and wisdom are the worst.

Today, like sometimes, I bend the rule too. Let’s play their game, right? Break some own mind created social rules that in my opinion put the society under control and for what? Nobody follows, just me.

When I have to break then I feel very bad with myself in the same time knowing that everybody will break too in the same position. And no one is going to help you. 

Another issue with this ""code"" are the terrible social protocols created by the variables of the puzzles and mazes of this social rules.

Today is not a good day for me. Sorry about the wall.",1
"About non-verbal autism This is more focused towards the classical description of autism rather than Asperger's, but I'm curious about the subject and I couldn't find a satisfying answer on the internet.

Many autistic people are non-verbal, specially when young. What I'm curious about, out of pure ignorance, is why.

I mean, what exactly is going on inside their brains that don't allow them to express themselves verbally? I know it's not related to intelligence itself cause many of them are even geniuses. So, is it something related to anxiety, some part of the brain that doesn't develop as quickly as NTs, or something else?

PS: I don't mean to offend anyone with the question. I apologize in advance if it's rude or something.",1

"I always need to think and find the correct words before I can speak Others (mostly NT's) seem to answer questions instantly. They can also tell about themselves and their projects instantly. They can also hold a presentation, flawless: just generating it out of their brain, without  pausing to think. I have to overclock my head with tension to achieve this and my speech will become really fast because of it. 

How to acquire the instant memory access ability?

 When I speak, I first have to fetch everything from my brain, then form a sentence based on the fetched model, then validate it and then I can speak the sentence. Otherwise it will come out wrong, if I try to speak instantly. 

Then I have to pause, and then do it again. I can't fetch everything at once like they seem to do. It takes a lot of energy. 

Holding a sentence while first listing to others seemed like a good solution, but it is also energy draining. I also loose the sentence sometimes.",1
"How can I support my niece (9F) who was diagnosed recently? Hi, everyone. My niece (9F) who lives close to us and often spends time with us was recently diagnosed. She struggles a lot with social interaction, which is one of worries since her school is now transitioning from virtual to face-to-face classes.

How can I support her? When you were younger, what type of support did you wish you have? Any practical tips that we can start implementing? 

We really want to support her and set her up for success. Unfortunately, where we’re from, talking about these are still pretty taboo causing very limited resources for us. :(",1

"Having aspergers feels like living life in spectator mode I always forget that I exist. Like I’m mentally there but not physically.

Someone else who feels like this?",1
"How to appear more physically confident? Hello.

Throughout my years in high school, my friends always thought I had low self-esteem. However, I do not have low self-esteem. I started to become more aware of my actions to figure out why people thought I had low self-esteem. I discovered that I lower my voice because I have a really deep voice, and I do not want to sound intimidating. I also discovered that I fidget with my fingers, but I feel that I've improved in controlling it, but sometimes I do it unconsciously. I looked up ""How to be more confident?"" and found out that most of the answers and tips are things I and other autistic people struggle with. Things such as eye contact, facial expressions, voice, and fidgeting.  What are some tips you can share as an autistic person?  Thank you for your time.",1
